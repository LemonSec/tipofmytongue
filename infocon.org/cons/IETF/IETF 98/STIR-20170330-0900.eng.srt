in flight and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now managing</font>

60
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate freshness and then we will</font>

begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flogging on trying to move out</font>

discussion of stir certificates um

68

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,240
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> base I know but that the freshness</font>

part just the yeah yeah yeahs no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no my</font>

81
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three documents that are</font>

82
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,969
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much done at this point</font>

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,520
thankfully that's our secret e47 for

84
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">this passport and then certs are</font>

85
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">seaboard corbis and passport they kind</font>

86
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,878
of are the over the wire bits on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

87
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,138
wire component of stir and certs is what

88
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,599
we think we need to do to try to

89
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,589
articulate how protocol interacts with

90
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,760
trust anchors and so on next slide the

91
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,010
good news is<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're pretty</font>

92
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">much done with these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sense</font>

93
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,240
that um you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

94
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,610
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working class</font>

95
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,070
call we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg and now</font>

96
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,290
all developed issues are clear there's

97
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,910
still a little bit ly not to do and some

98
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,370
of that cleanup is actually on certs on

99
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,010
the certs draft so we're gonna talk a

100
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,180
bit about that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is at</font>

101
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,829
a point now where we can pull the

102
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,810
trigger and these when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

103
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hold certs at</font>

104
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,518
least for a little bit to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

105
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,589
we get this stuff taken care of

106
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,810
last-minute fixes yeah so um you know

107
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,490
because Chris and I were doing this

108
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,810
separately and then Sean was doing some

109
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,220
passes of store service and i was at

110
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,779
4474 bisque we had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:25,949
synchronization problems across the

112
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:27,540
drafts oh sure so one of the main

113
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:29,189
synchronization problems we found anyway

114
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,810
was just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bear syntax</font>

115
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,089
especially the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were talking</font>

116
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,399
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone numbers the last thing</font>

117
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we wanted to do when we embarked on this</font>

118
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,730
mission was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come with like yet</font>

119
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,160
another syntax or telephone numbers and

120
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,060
that's part of the reason why 4474<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc</font>

121
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,980
took this approach of doing

122
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,319
canonicalization instead we basically

123
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,560
just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn out a process that you</font>

124
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,969
can use to turn telephone numbers as

125
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,609
they are rendered through formats like

126
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,649
RC 3966 they tell you RL format that's

127
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,440
commonly used for sip as well into

128
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,360
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will look clean and we'll</font>

129
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,630
probably end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up resolving to the same</font>

130
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,180
bass string of numbers no matter who is

131
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,449
a gap you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is uh looking at what</font>

132
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,589
the original of turn out to be so any we

133
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,030
want one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we've come up</font>

134
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,980
with on this that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on the list</font>

135
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,110
recently is this question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether or</font>

136
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,670
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> p NS can include pound or star and</font>

137
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,080
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something where we had at one</font>

138
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,180
way in one draft by the way in other

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">graphs we need to get that fundamentally</font>

140
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,109
synchronized but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> only even came</font>

141
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,270
into this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition to</font>

142
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,040
canonical izing the from that is the

143
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,230
calling party<font color="#E5E5E5"> number we're also</font>

144
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,110
canonical izing the from are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two the</font>

145
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,330
called party number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the called party</font>

146
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">number in a lot of instances can end up</font>

147
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,050
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> markup like this that's messy and</font>

148
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,210
like actually discarding that markup

149
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,069
discards semantics that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

150
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,040
preserve and so it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

151
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know kind of corner case that</font>

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,329
we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up eventually saying okay like</font>

153
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,240
we'll have that be part of what we

154
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,640
capture in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> search document as well I</font>

155
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,860
don't know is mr. hammer in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

156
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,800
room or it's not in the room is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he think</font>

157
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,900
I see him there I mean you know I'd know

158
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,469
Mike for a long time I know he knows his

159
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,510
numbers yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what we've got to</font>

160
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,850
rust from your interaction with him so

161
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:19,800
what do you think we we need to tweak on

162
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,720
us um I guess we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it through a</font>

163
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,030
working group last call we've now gone

164
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,360
through ITF last call with the pound and

165
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,100
the star included even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though range you</font>

166
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,660
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have a number that has a</font>

167
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,400
pound or star in it you say and 19

168
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,339
consecutive numbers following it doesn't

169
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,260
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense I don't think the</font>

170
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,520
certificate issuers going to do that

171
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,439
right so this is why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> brought up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

172
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,329
distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between what is in the two</font>

173
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,710
and what's in the Frog correct see we're

174
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,090
really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about ranges</font>

175
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,430
of numbers these certificates when we're

176
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,440
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Authority probably signed in</font>

177
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,569
front right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only that is</font>

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,290
the car comment that was received

179
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,120
yesterday and so and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's okay I</font>

180
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to trust the</font>

181
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,390
certificate issue or is not to do that

182
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,209
otherwise we have to have different

183
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">asn.1 for the two places yeah that's the</font>

184
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,730
choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I like I say I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

185
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,010
okay like some again the corner of a

186
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,570
corner case like deep down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're</font>

187
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,370
doing this like diversion stuff that

188
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,870
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been looking at I can maybe see</font>

189
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,310
cases where that would interact with

190
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so I mean I I don't want to dismiss</font>

191
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,060
it out of hand but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same time I</font>

192
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,660
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a sense you could do</font>

193
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,089
reasonable things with this

194
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,650
would not not run afoul<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that so</font>

195
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,780
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice so does and they wouldn't</font>

196
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,400
think we need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the take the step to</font>

197
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:43,240
define in range a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not</font>

198
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,920
include start out let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin the</font>

199
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">night all right so no one raised their</font>

200
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:53,380
hands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> would the minute taker make</font>

201
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,300
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is included</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks we did</font>

202
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,740
a few other things I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did write</font>

203
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,810
that are probably good like you know

204
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,430
getting the syntax or passport claims

205
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris and I had an exchange for that</font>

206
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,870
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a ski or utf-8 and it's kind</font>

207
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,520
of confusing because of course we're

208
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,410
inheriting all this from JWT and

209
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,300
passport jadi buti is in turn inheriting

210
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,740
the ship jws and when you fall it's like

211
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,020
turtles all the way down they came in

212
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,610
find where you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody to find the</font>

213
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,490
semantics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sudden say that JSON</font>

214
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,370
generally could be utf-8 or utf-16 or GF

215
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,440
3 2 and so basically said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine</font>

216
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,340
we'll put a restriction and ness like

217
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,840
when you're registering claims your

218
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,850
passport they ought to be like asking

219
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,070
right and this is not an unreasonable

220
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,830
like everything is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JWT registry</font>

221
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,120
already is within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii range I you</font>

222
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,770
know again except for some like

223
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,500
internationalization cases where people

224
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:41,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have really weird claim names</font>

225
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,790
for that I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could conceivably</font>

226
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,790
imagine it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really more the</font>

227
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,250
values I think then the claim names that

228
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,160
need to have that you know the UTF

229
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,220
whatever in it so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put that</font>

230
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:01,689
constraint in is just a ski Oh mr. Schad

231
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:05,890
you have a concern with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jim</font>

232
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,400
shot um<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we talking just the peg or</font>

233
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,449
we talkin<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I useful just the tag</font>

234
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,890
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the value needs to be</font>

235
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,780
internationalized school yeah so we're

236
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it's basically like a Diana</font>

237
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">constraint for us when you're</font>

238
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:20,350
registering the tag name for the claim

239
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:25,030
name we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a ski for</font>

240
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:31,450
this that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a yeah emoticons in this n</font>

241
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:33,760
thumbs up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pizza Pizza yes anyway we also</font>

242
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,930
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix the date text a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

243
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how we interact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the i-80 and</font>

244
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords to the date in</font>

245
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,350
the sip header that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

246
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:48,700
Ben I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think made about this that we</font>

247
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,650
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get cleaned up um and also</font>

248
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,330
been was concerned I think justifiably

249
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,819
it sounded too much like we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

250
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,170
standardize reason phrases we kind of

251
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,060
had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> text and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was too strong</font>

252
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,040
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we rolled that back again but the</font>

253
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,660
stuff that we did in response I see most

254
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,620
of it was like small small stuff like

255
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,910
this but now we're gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font>

256
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the more substantial issues I just</font>

257
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,089
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure everybody here is</font>

258
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,340
aware out before we go forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font>

259
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:15,519
the trigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this so next slide okay</font>

260
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,519
[Music]

261
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:30,209
yeah this now works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is an</font>

262
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,249
interesting one so this might require a

263
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:34,169
little bit of a back story so a little

264
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:36,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways back we thought we were to have a</font>

265
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:37,709
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of assurance indicator that was</font>

266
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,539
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in the circuit itself it</font>

267
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,329
kind of gave a sense to you of how high

268
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:44,249
the confidence was in the attestation of

269
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,449
authority control assignment whatever

270
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,859
you want to call it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

271
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,238
words were perfect right but whatever

272
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:50,609
the relationship is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were binding</font>

273
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,410
these telephone network resources to

274
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,519
these certificates we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

275
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,259
be handy to have like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

276
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,989
assurance something at us was interested

277
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:01,139
then when ads decided to migrate that to

278
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:02,879
a claim in<font color="#E5E5E5"> passport instead of actually</font>

279
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,439
having in syrup we still thought it

280
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be useful in the serve to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

281
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:10,228
to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feature that would let you</font>

282
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:12,899
say passports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are signed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by this</font>

283
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:14,729
cert can are constrained only sign like

284
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this level of assurance for example</font>

285
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:18,149
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we imagine that there is an loa</font>

286
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:20,129
claim that's called you know that

287
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,959
appears and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pastures called loa and that</font>

288
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,549
loi can have three values high medium or

289
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,079
low just pulling this up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half I've</font>

290
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,839
christened<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure can't articulate what</font>

291
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,089
you're actually doing we could then put

292
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,879
this thing we call the JWT claim

293
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,829
constrained into the surf would say for

294
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">passports signed by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sir if there is</font>

295
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:40,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">a claim of value confidence it has to be</font>

296
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,600
low right and this would be something

297
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,910
the ca could kind of levy on the search

298
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,799
were issued to make in this would depend

299
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,499
on again who you were issuing certs to

300
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,519
and what role they have in the network

301
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,410
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to turn this</font>

302
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,209
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generic capability because we</font>

303
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,499
thought you know that's useful for this

304
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,449
but I could also imagine let's say we're

305
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:59,369
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see nap and I want</font>

306
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to issue you a sir and let's</font>

307
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,069
imagine it's an individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> T answered I</font>

308
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,469
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room that</font>

309
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:05,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is no such</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> animal</font>

311
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:10,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the moment you know if I issue you an</font>

312
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,209
end user sir and it has this scene am

313
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">claim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that suppose represent the color</font>

314
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,659
name I could put one of these gave you

315
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,839
give your key claim constraints and it

316
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:21,209
says you know if Shawn Turner is going

317
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,888
to sign any passports with this if seen

318
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,079
em is present it must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the value</font>

319
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:27,599
Shawn Turner this stray so that's

320
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,200
basically the concept behind this russ

321
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind enough to patch this up for us</font>

322
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,100
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran into a couple of problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

323
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,689
this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is key review one</font>

324
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,070
them was that we kind of first<font color="#CCCCCC"> grazed it</font>

325
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,289
like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> both a blacklist and a</font>

326
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,350
whitelist like okay we're gonna phrase

327
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:45,730
this so you know if when we issue a sir

328
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,959
we can list here's the things that

329
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,940
you're allowed to use here's the things

330
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,260
you're not allowed to use well I mean it

331
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,030
turns out that those having both the

332
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,620
wait list in the bad list ruins all

333
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,149
these good like additive permissions

334
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,010
properties we tend to like in designing

335
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,090
security systems like this so we

336
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,220
devolved it down to something that is

337
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,280
merely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a white less in other words if</font>

338
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,270
jdid claim constraints is present<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

339
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,530
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then there are no</font>

340
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,629
constraints you can put whatever claims

341
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,700
in you want but if its present then you

342
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,770
were restricted to using just the set of

343
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,909
claims that it specifies now of course

344
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do assume that all of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baseline</font>

345
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,450
claims that are defined in the passport

346
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">specification are automatically</font>

347
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,610
whitelisted so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really for</font>

348
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,020
extensions like<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

349
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,080
that's the model we ended up with I

350
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works Sean I had like a bad</font>

351
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,789
merge<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in that 13 that came out so we</font>

352
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,379
we put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that still had some</font>

353
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:37,299
exclude text in it so we actually

354
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,770
managed to tear all that out now in the

355
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:41,260
version we just issued this week I think

356
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be clean this is exactly</font>

357
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">right yet so there's one last thing I</font>

358
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,220
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people feel</font>

359
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,950
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in on this so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way the</font>

360
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,659
text reads now when you define a<font color="#E5E5E5"> genuine</font>

361
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">key claim constraint you end up defining</font>

362
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:57,100
like I said both the claim name for this

363
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,280
claim name like seen em you must have

364
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,809
this value right a sign for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it something</font>

365
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,360
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4cm it has to be Shawn</font>

366
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,908
Turner it strikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it could also be</font>

367
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,530
useful to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JD OT claim constraint</font>

368
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:10,630
that merely authorizes the use of a

369
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,450
particular claim without stipulating any

370
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:16,570
value for it so in other words you know

371
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,419
maybe I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C nams when</font>

372
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,918
you sign with this sir right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

373
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,539
care what CM value you put in because

374
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,309
you're like colored right you're an

375
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:26,650
enterprise and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got like 10,000</font>

376
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,820
you know numbers you can sign for there

377
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,350
and you might have different scene ends

378
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,299
prettyful ones of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to have</font>

379
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you 10,000 different search for</font>

380
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,080
these see names I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you</font>

381
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">know anything that Cullen's enterprise</font>

382
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,289
assigning they can put whatever CNN they

383
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,610
wanted it the syntax day doesn't

384
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:45,040
actually allow that so what we could do

385
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,918
Russ<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you know how to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this no</font>

386
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,510
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make it so that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value part of</font>

387
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,760
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually optional right</font>

388
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,290
define g2g give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> claim concerns</font>

389
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,710
you have to say what the claim is that's

390
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,510
like mandatory for it but the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

391
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,950
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we either can include</font>

392
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:05,379
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so the way it's defined right now</font>

393
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,290
if the extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not there you're not</font>

394
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,220
constrained in any way right second

395
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:15,550
thing is if you put a constraint in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

396
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,940
providing a list of values our field may

397
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,700
may contain so in like the example

398
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,140
that's in the document is confidence

399
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,140
which you know it's allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have high</font>

400
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,620
medium low you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could tell that that</font>

401
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:35,560
particular issue or must use low that

402
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:38,229
issuer of JWT's must include high so

403
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:43,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're only authorizing them</font>

404
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:46,900
to issue tokens with high so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

405
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,690
current approach if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were just there</font>

406
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,980
is no mechanism to say you must include

407
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,550
a JWT of a particular claim yeah how do

408
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:00,400
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism</font>

409
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:03,040
that says you may include because the

410
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,000
lack of a constraint already says you

411
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,590
may include it right so that the one

412
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,360
again maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a corner facing the</font>

413
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,409
can't hear is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one where there is a</font>

414
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,090
claim I want to allow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signer to sign</font>

415
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,860
for passports that this claim in it but

416
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,270
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily want to say you that</font>

417
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,000
there are specific values I know about

418
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:27,160
beforehand you have to attach to it no

419
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,440
constraint gives you that already well

420
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,900
not necess no because it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for</font>

421
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,450
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to give Cullen like</font>

422
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,610
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lets him do see nams but</font>

423
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,140
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for somebody else have them</font>

424
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,760
not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seen handsome we do</font>

425
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,760
not have a mechanism that does that

426
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,710
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we must have introduced that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

427
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,050
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you how to do myself I can put</font>

428
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,520
know is my David she claimed constrained

429
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,659
and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only claim that</font>

430
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,520
you're allowed to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> its null and</font>

431
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,620
therefore you can't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNM or divert or</font>

432
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,389
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that that is a hack</font>

433
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,929
there's a workaround but I mean the

434
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,910
point is putting one

435
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,890
just put one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the claim</font>

436
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,320
constraints field necessarily you can't

437
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,660
do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other claims right that no</font>

438
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,750
you're not saying anything about the

439
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:18,350
other claims um supposed to be a white

440
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">last right instead I don't know it's a</font>

441
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:26,179
white list of values it has nothing

442
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:31,970
about Ramon of names of claims that are

443
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:33,920
not listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we need to venerate</font>

444
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,170
so if you have if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a requirement</font>

445
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:41,750
this document doesn't do it um I suspect

446
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,650
that's a requirement but<font color="#CCCCCC"> pressing ok</font>

447
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">come on yeah Chris one per second we</font>

448
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:51,980
would need that for specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

449
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jackie which we cannot determine High</font>

450
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,500
Prairie what the value would be yeah you

451
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">could make the argument further notice</font>

452
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,780
but you could say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of three</font>

453
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,030
values but well so i think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

454
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably for a ridge ID you use this</font>

455
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:13,360
mechanism so do you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mandate</font>

456
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:16,850
the inclusion of a claim of that name

457
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,639
mandate right any claim that doesn't

458
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,679
contain would be like if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

459
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shake the extension you must have</font>

460
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,970
them a test them or a je claims set of

461
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">these so when we spoke at soup if that</font>

462
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,110
wasn't a requirement well it's like the

463
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,389
point is you but it is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

464
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:40,459
separate file yes like you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

465
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,870
use no I'm just it so this is chris you

466
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,520
you have almost every profile rate for

467
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">shaken you can just say this is required</font>

468
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,940
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> she's shaken right i mean you</font>

469
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,280
have a whole separate layer like plugs

470
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,760
in on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all this right so i'm in</font>

471
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,850
through um true but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

472
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,320
mechanically network that right so this

473
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,889
is so like i said i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font>

474
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:05,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't real quite have this yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i suspect</font>

475
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's talk about this a little more um</font>

476
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,419
just as note taker so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand what</font>

477
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,699
I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> written down yeah um I'm</font>

478
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,510
hearing ross also say this really can't

479
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,580
be used as a white listing

480
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:24,240
in which you were envisioning it because

481
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:29,790
you can't say constrain it to this and

482
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,260
no others that's correct yeah i mean it

483
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value of that again</font>

484
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't anticipate possible</font>

485
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,580
extensions you know we wanted to have

486
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to look more like an additive</font>

487
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,929
model but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid is a</font>

488
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,740
model where but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a</font>

489
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,030
model where<font color="#CCCCCC"> cas can ultimately deal with</font>

490
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,610
entities they're generating search for

491
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,500
that they want to disempower in some

492
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,030
crucial ways because they think they

493
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,460
have a different status in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

494
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,399
right and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have I think a</font>

495
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:01,500
flexible tool on it unfortunate maybe

496
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:06,120
for disempowering people heading on any

497
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:10,980
I've won this since I'm not employ Evie

498
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,070
screams syntax is there a way to do

499
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,040
while carving on without not right now

500
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,899
like right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now by not constraining it is</font>

501
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,149
wild card yeah but but I mean if you

502
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,630
wanted to say you have to have this tag

503
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:27,240
which you use any value if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

504
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">a value for star okay right right that's</font>

505
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,180
on saying right yes we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

506
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,990
something like that but it's a special

507
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:37,140
piece whatever she knew you would have

508
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to thank mr. specific but I suspect it's</font>

509
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,080
unavoidable anyway I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

510
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,730
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plank for cut into 17 now so is</font>

511
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,080
that that would where I'd allowable<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

512
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure there's some way to do this in</font>

513
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah isn't that one we also have some</font>

514
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,260
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there must be wayness and I</font>

515
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:05,220
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say so this plums everything</font>

516
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:08,879
would a list of claims of a particular

517
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,570
name or list of names must be included

518
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that adequate if then you also have</font>

519
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current mechanism which says if this</font>

520
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:24,629
claim is present it must be one of the

521
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,890
following values um prolly I mean it

522
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,540
feels like we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to collapse</font>

523
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,400
those into one mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratan having</font>

524
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,560
like two separate lives no no

525
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,500
be in the same extension if they're just

526
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">read a separate fields and how to do</font>

527
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,210
that with one a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-line change you know</font>

528
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,460
to do with one line change<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russ then I</font>

529
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're done Oda said that sounds me</font>

530
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,400
I will get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font>

531
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,380
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the search bigger in a way</font>

532
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,420
that's annoying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we do want to</font>

533
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep these things real small I'm sorry</font>

534
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:56,190
this how about I write up a slide this

535
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,610
recognition kind of excited for this

536
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:04,740
thanks so are you referring so I'm

537
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:07,110
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of an example here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bass</font>

538
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,020
claims can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered as well right so</font>

539
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,540
like for example telephone number would

540
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:20,330
be well so we have a ridge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> desk all</font>

541
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:24,210
are automatically white as they have the

542
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:28,530
policy heart covering covering that the

543
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,420
policy would I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that's not</font>

544
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,960
intention not that's not intended this

545
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,720
is only for retention claims it's only

546
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,730
for extension claim yeah yes well or we

547
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,830
could include the it's how were we

548
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,810
describe it but the base<font color="#E5E5E5"> three should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

549
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,970
there right I mean you can't exclude one

550
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,830
of them I mean TN auth Lestrade provides

551
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,320
the property already this is a telephone

552
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">number for which yeah right yeah so I</font>

553
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it think about it it's like similar</font>

554
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah we're just trying to find</font>

555
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,760
ways that we can a flexible extensible

556
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,710
mechanism we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to say we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

557
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,840
put other restrictions on what passports

558
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,910
signed by the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> or allowed to</font>

559
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,139
a task so it's very similar to jan was

560
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,970
kind of our starting case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

561
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,990
this is a attempt to<font color="#CCCCCC"> genera size that</font>

562
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,510
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to me I unfortunately I</font>

563
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,270
didn't catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I was imagining</font>

564
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:21,780
this to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a you must have these</font>

565
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:23,940
canoes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so go well we can</font>

566
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,730
yep we can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specific line in</font>

567
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">lenguin than having both there but okay</font>

568
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,060
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cook good examples so that the</font>

569
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,780
former again was would be things like

570
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,850
loa<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right where if L away</font>

571
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,610
is gonna be present you know you for you

572
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,350
you can only issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of love yeah</font>

573
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,000
that's that's that that was the

574
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,678
that's where we started on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

575
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they said this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know this was the</font>

576
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,470
attempt to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and turn it into</font>

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,740
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be useful for other</font>

578
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:57,090
extensions we anticipating other than ly

579
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:58,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still not quite well you</font>

580
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,799
mentioned Christine I'm an example as

581
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,780
one possible we went to enforce that

582
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:08,120
they commit you're in this particular

583
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:12,030
sub case way understand requirement is

584
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,928
want to enforce a plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> or Cena but you</font>

585
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:17,700
obviously don't know for example exactly

586
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:23,880
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> value this thing is going to have</font>

587
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:26,400
some possible what is the value what is

588
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,850
the value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they clean it</font>

589
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,710
essentially impact this that's what I'm

590
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,649
still trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand well is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

591
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:37,590
you can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something I knew I</font>

592
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:41,700
don't know in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these fields to I</font>

593
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,799
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um to see nominalism yeah I</font>

594
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,659
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to imagine again an</font>

595
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,100
instance where something more like an

596
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,350
enterprise right where you're delegating

597
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bureau carrier I have a business</font>

598
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,789
relationship with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cullen's</font>

599
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,918
enterprise and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Collins enterprise</font>

600
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:57,870
starts emitting bizarre or seniors like

601
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,179
our business relationship compensates

602
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,678
fat right in some way but I have I've

603
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,210
explicitly delegated the authority for

604
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,500
selecting that to Cullen but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

605
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that for Adam so I don't</font>

606
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,250
trust Adam right so an issue Adam shirts

607
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,470
I want the search to say he can't do see

608
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,850
now put any values of that so let's go

609
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:17,789
in with distinction yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

610
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:21,539
why to see if I summarize because it's a

611
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:24,030
whitelist only model if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

612
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:28,400
to be do anything you want model we put

613
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:31,408
yourself we have to numerate be

614
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,260
explicitly that which now means we have

615
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,120
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do that understand well</font>

616
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,150
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to see because i think</font>

617
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:43,289
i've certainly lost in the weeds are

618
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:45,809
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> my seriously so again the</font>

619
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:48,600
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why wouldn't the wild</font>

620
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:51,120
college or the value that please work I

621
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,530
mean again this is purely semantics or

622
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,879
syntactical question about how we do

623
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send that one Russ is the</font>

624
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,999
expert in that are ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you can</font>

625
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,259
put a star in it

626
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:00,209
and networks nascent of what I think

627
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're done found that's just the oh I</font>

628
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:05,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regreses our expert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

629
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:06,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Russ's our expert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

630
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,859
whatever Russ says is the right way

631
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:10,349
syntactically do that Miss and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

632
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:12,149
we're gonna do it that much my I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

633
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,319
know myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

634
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:14,339
talked about this thing we have a plan I

635
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,839
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could probably move on to other</font>

636
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:22,259
stuff oh I've had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so long have</font>

637
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:33,899
you see love I put it somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

638
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:36,149
this looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes this is</font>

639
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,619
another issue that was non-trivial that

640
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,748
we dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with enough Adam thank you very</font>

641
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,149
much for actually taking the time to

642
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:43,619
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4916 that connect identity document</font>

643
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:48,119
and compare it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we were doing in</font>

644
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:49,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">passport and RC 4474 abyss we knew that</font>

645
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,609
there might be some interaction here

646
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,289
over in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP Randy working group</font>

647
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,789
which is not meeting this week we

648
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,549
actually need to use connected identity

649
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:58,589
because we want to have both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the end</font>

650
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,699
the end points of a call be acting as

651
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:01,829
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication service and</font>

652
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:04,829
verification service roles of our secret

653
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:06,329
474 bez and that does require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kinetic</font>

654
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:09,779
identity to work for reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get</font>

655
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:12,569
into their kind of complicated but Adam

656
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,119
rightly pointed out that the this led to

657
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:17,219
necessarily some fixes we needed to text

658
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,139
about retransmissions that's in 4474

659
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:21,539
best the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could retry a</font>

660
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:24,688
request that had failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

661
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,429
a somewhat useful property<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

662
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:29,549
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we originally decided we wanted to</font>

663
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:31,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this when the earliest networks that</font>

664
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:34,289
we try to send any of you sign request

665
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:36,989
through bounced it because the date was

666
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:38,729
being written and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay well</font>

667
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:41,579
what we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

668
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:43,649
to move from the compact for a passport

669
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,809
full form a passport in those instances

670
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:50,279
so that the date can be recovered from

671
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:52,079
IT by the blowing party and that led you

672
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,729
us introducing all this text about ways

673
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,438
you redrawing a retransmission and

674
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:57,629
repairable errors all that is really

675
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:59,759
good the text gets complicated though

676
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:02,188
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> precise ways thats if does</font>

677
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,719
loop detection and moreover detects this

678
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,729
condition called spirals when you do

679
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:07,319
suspension for<font color="#CCCCCC"> king when kind of things</font>

680
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,399
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy server and sit end up</font>

681
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,589
looking back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and go somewhere</font>

682
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,830
else we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of work and set to</font>

683
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,750
try

684
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,269
fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the years there are other</font>

685
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,279
RCS or we address this behavior and so

686
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:19,860
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is added some 4474</font>

687
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">bist text that said pay attention to</font>

688
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,879
that here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the places where you can run</font>

689
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,559
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there is a should and thirty</font>

690
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,630
to sixty one in particular that we're

691
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,158
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of overriding in this and saying OK</font>

692
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,590
and since you probably don't have to do

693
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,970
what that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> says because otherwise</font>

694
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,029
you might think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a loop when it's</font>

695
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,169
not there really is it Scott its kind of

696
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,700
down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weeds what that is so I'd</font>

697
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:39,870
say we read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the text you're interested</font>

698
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,090
it's all in those sections about

699
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,100
retransmission in authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> service</font>

700
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,959
and verification service behavior but

701
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,990

706
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:09,540

707
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,970

709
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:16,379
stable but those tweaks which is good

710
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,580
some of the tweaks again and if you had

711
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,940
to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in store search for</font>

712
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,549
them as well so those those are really

713
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,869
good to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think now</font>

714
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,909
first nurse are just more maybe than

715
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:35,040
just weeks let's talk about what we did

716
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:36,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a little bit on the next I was</font>

717
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do these all's like separate</font>

718
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerpoints originally but then I just</font>

719
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:42,089
was like I read the agenda and realized

720
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was just believe me so just one</font>

721
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:49,529
PowerPoint next<font color="#CCCCCC"> leg so this document got</font>

folks like Steve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Farrell surly professor</font>

724
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,790
at trinity college or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

725
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we have those blocking points now</font>

726
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,160
resolved and actually made some very

727
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,069
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> points these are important things</font>

728
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,868
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address in dixon us there is</font>

729
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,369
one thing still outstanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Becker</font>

730
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,480
wants to have some better text in there

731
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,210
about tea and range arithmetic

732
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,250
boundaries he has sent me that taxed and

733
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,680
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it into a 14 or do it in or</font>

734
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,080
48 it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a one-sentence</font>

735
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,899
tweak that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there are some</font>

736
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,650
other major changes that are still

737
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,650
warrants and review and discussion

738
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,250
yea though this talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the</font>

739
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,500
past like four months I'm looking at you

740
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Mary over there you add us people</font>

741
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:37,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">well this like OC ends speeds alts bids</font>

742
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots fault yes so so we kind of you know</font>

743
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,799
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Addis figured out and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your</font>

744
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,270
problem right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what and OC n is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

745
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,619
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all identifiers is there</font>

746
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,329
specifically to telephone network that

747
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:49,060
you use to identify who carriers are

748
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:51,359
there not ITF identifiers and there's

749
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,859
this organization called<font color="#CCCCCC"> nikka right the</font>

750
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,098
carrier group that yeah neca that does

751
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:58,750
this they assign them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their format</font>

752
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">as define these out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of specifications</font>

753
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,400
and like they're really important though

754
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,410
for us in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that we do want to</font>

755
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,820
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the basically the</font>

756
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,490
subject of a certificate that we issue

757
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">could this be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the carrier's an</font>

758
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,250
identifier of the carrier that is

759
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,570
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went through a million</font>

760
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">iterations of us trying to figure out</font>

761
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,380
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way to do that was</font>

762
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,000
eventually lighted on OC ends but then

763
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,530
people started asking harder questions

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,869
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay networks sure like North</font>

765
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,420
America right but like what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

766
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:26,890
actually do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know in Europe</font>

767
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,300
what do you do for this and like each

768
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:33,190
specific and after like a lot of going

769
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,660
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maypole yeah</font>

770
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,369
we've introduced new concept it's called

771
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,560
service provider codes this came out of

772
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:41,349
at us basically this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

773
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASCII string and reassume probably for</font>

774
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shakin profile that it will conform</font>

775
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,560
to OC ends and with a lot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lucy ends</font>

776
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:50,050
do but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave the door open to</font>

777
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">other profiles of sep other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poster</font>

778
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,160
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use these identifiers</font>

779
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,690
to specify something else it's a bit of

780
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,848
a blank<font color="#E5E5E5"> check in the sense we really are</font>

781
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,800
saying somebody else has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to work</font>

782
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:01,180
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we left in some text</font>

783
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,099
indicating it's probably something like

784
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">ocms that we're dealing with a senate</font>

785
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:11,380
say any of one of it questions and we

786
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:14,319
just not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued Wow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implicitly says</font>

787
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,740
let's assume I'm basically I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

788
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:22,380
you document nobody except the US and

789
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:24,879
maybe one as a pretty functional system

790
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,329
except in the mobile space yeah football

791
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,720
spaces international that's not an issue

792
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:34,250
landline space just<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing seems to</font>

793
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,029
have yeah so

794
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,940
there are two issues namely one is is

795
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,850
there ever a possibility because it is

796
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,870
not despite the physician ocn that we

797
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:51,080
wander into whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> canadian or mexican</font>

798
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:54,049
territory accidentally and now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

799
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,750
thought was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nico or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CN is now</font>

800
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else something you don't</font>

801
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,840
recognize but it is a money look at

802
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:06,590
distances<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

803
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">talion carrier code and no it's not</font>

804
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so I</font>

805
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,990
I think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a</font>

806
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,700
pretty good one actually which is again

807
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,899
all these regions have a they're going

808
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,339
to have their own specific trust anchors

809
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,710
this you a test these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other</font>

810
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,540
words things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that neca attests and maybe</font>

811
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,400
some surgeries he actually find<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

812
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,020
Steph I'm of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trust anchor and so</font>

813
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,250
when you go to whatever other country

814
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,680
even if they happen to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers</font>

815
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ours right then</font>

816
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,799
they'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different trust anchor</font>

817
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:34,190
that's I took metric documented just so

818
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I do that if you have a string that</font>

819
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I've always undefined it's always</font>

820
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">good to know what for namespaces got it</font>

821
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:46,040
yeah I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and your second one</font>

822
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,910
is that goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile one</font>

823
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,730
should we worry about that namespace I

824
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:56,690
mean I kaylene well because I mean again

825
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:59,720
because that is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest to</font>

826
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:04,240
me international namespace as as we got

827
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:06,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">old document said is actually the pseudo</font>

828
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,399
kill you so don't actually have wireless

829
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:13,430
operation is getting these ones because

830
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,810
best if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I so I don't know if</font>

831
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,569
that's aI don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could boy about</font>

832
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:21,799
it now but at some point I suspect that

833
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:23,990
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a helpful thing</font>

834
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,480
particularly because of what wireless

835
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,359
roaming and other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

836
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening real i wonder i mean i guess a</font>

837
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">screw gpp picks this up obviously it</font>

838
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,810
which i understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are I'd be happy</font>

839
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work with them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that I</font>

840
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,930
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing and maybe maybe</font>

841
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,240
Christopher you know right i mean are we

842
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,069
going to run afoul of anything by making

843
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,779
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just asking I mean is there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

844
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be in that inner fire space</font>

845
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,460
that we're not thinking of right that

846
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:54,289
that might be outside that you don't

847
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,839
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah I got it too so again I we</font>

848
00:39:54,289 --> 00:40:00,200
make you just a ski I assume in Brooklyn

849
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:02,630
down together if you only wanted I can

850
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,740
introduce you get in the North American

851
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,789
station because you have the wireless

852
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:13,758
world I or is if we ever get to mobile

853
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:15,650
area code for that it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

854
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:18,529
syntactically distinguishable but it

855
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,059
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad idea to look at the</font>

856
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:22,490
number of characters in the string to

857
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:24,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide whether it again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

858
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,720
the gist mayor whoever I will be signing

859
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,579
for the you know the mobile codes for

860
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,230
that right and in it there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

861
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,670
different entity that is the trust

862
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,019
anchor for it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that has to be the</font>

863
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,130
differentiator but you're you're right

864
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:39,439
to point out we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that in the</font>

865
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:41,480
stack so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah so the service</font>

866
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,180
writer code concept came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> addis</font>

867
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,400
and that's because even with ananas we

868
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,169
actually couldn't agree on this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

869
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,410
know that it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose the end for north</font>

870
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,269
america<font color="#CCCCCC"> even right oh really shave it I</font>

871
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,129
should even say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kidding me I oh</font>

872
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:58,758
yeah no I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not kidding you I'm actually</font>

873
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,769
I'm not I'm serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're for</font>

874
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:02,029
people that said company code is the

875
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:04,038
ultimate authority that depends upon

876
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:06,499
which ad is document you're using in

877
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,539
which taxonomy in which organization is

878
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:10,788
is managing the things fun day this

879
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:15,829
isn't in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack right this is on my</font>

880
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:18,529
slide very little in the IETF specs it

881
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:21,499
needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii string is</font>

882
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:23,569
sufficient and very generic term is all

883
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:26,839
that you need and let it needs to move

884
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:28,910
up some layers away from IETF internship

885
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:30,259
oh I really this we have no business

886
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:35,420
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this man this is all are you</font>

887
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:37,069
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine with me anything else about</font>

888
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,170
this one and the sooner I can get her

889
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:40,579
whistle in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the happier I'll be I'm just</font>

890
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get out of everybody else's</font>

891
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:52,339
way on this so yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so okay</font>

892
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,410
bring a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple slides per second to</font>

893
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:57,739
repair a problem during the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do</font>

894
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,259
a little bit of a juggling nah that's

895
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:02,940
fine

896
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,680
[Music]

897
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,499
I'm sure I could look at what my next

898
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,980
slide is and we could start talking

899
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about anyone</font>

900
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:28,230
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this we get into the hard</font>

901
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,680
one which is freshness I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> rific</font>

902
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:34,410
addressing this a lot of oh we could

903
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,149
just was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some bob marley already</font>

904
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:43,680
coming in is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a being streamed</font>

905
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:47,070
already web RTC yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> today yeah um</font>

906
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,169
so a lot of the concerns that we've

907
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:53,520
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to get freshness in</font>

908
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:56,670
particular here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the data that</font>

909
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,680
we're potentially revealing when we

910
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:02,220
perform real-time status checks

911
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated certificates and Stephen had</font>

912
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,919
a number of points of discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

913
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,510
this but the main one was ocsp and i'll

914
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some diagrams to explain is being a</font>

915
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,170
bit it's a protocol to use kind of in

916
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,609
real time for relying party to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

917
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,500
to verify that it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still</font>

918
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,450
valid when you get it score certificates

919
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like all these things can</font>

920
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:23,730
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them and because we are doing</font>

921
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,799
things with tiens they're kind of fancy

922
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,320
telephone numbers we made some further

923
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,610
tweaks to ocsp and unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

924
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,890
those tweaks do make the information

925
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ocsp reveals more interesting</font>

926
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,859
especially to the purpose actors as we

927
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,390
call them to too pervasive monitoring

928
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,010
systems there's kind of eavesdropping on

929
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,859
the internet you can gather a lot of

930
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,330
metadata from that and although there's

931
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,340
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text about using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OCS being</font>

932
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">confidentiality like you can apparently</font>

933
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,470
do it over HTTP and thus do it over to

934
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,480
us that might help a bit there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

935
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:56,730
ton of bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> idiots that's revealed by</font>

936
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,890
bath itself so we can and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

937
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,720
better slide um but you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

938
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,029
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know how to yeah and</font>

939
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,629
so after a lot of deliberation what we

940
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:11,010
basically done is fun to this the text

941
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,150
about freshness we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

942
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,260
discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there about yours</font>

943
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,760
approaches it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it uh</font>

944
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we're ready yet</font>

945
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,020
without some operational experience and

946
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,120
maybe some further thinking about it to

947
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,480
stipulate that any one true way to do

948
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,220
this anyway so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is by far the</font>

949
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,540
largest change to the store<font color="#E5E5E5"> shirt</font>

950
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">stocking the came out of eyes to your</font>

951
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,779
view we removed a lot of tax that used

952
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,630
to be in there that explained exactly

953
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,950
how you do with this with ocsp

954
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,300
that's now all in a separate document

955
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,740
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna talk about but you know</font>

956
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,970
people should know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be</font>

957
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,799
cool with that people think is

958
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,129
desperately important that we do is to

959
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,060
forget freshness at this stage I'm gonna

960
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,980
make an argument that I think

961
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,450
certificate freshness matters I don't

962
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it matters so much we can't go</font>

963
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,509
forward with the store<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort sake without</font>

964
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,840
it though I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really is</font>

965
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,670
something that we can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do some</font>

966
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,320
useful implementation work if we don't

967
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:07,190
quite understand this perfectly yeah so

968
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,690
provided no one in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

969
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,520
it up and cry and say that if we don't

970
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,100
get this right now we shouldn't proceed

971
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,870
that is our plan we did as well leave in

972
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,870
this approach of providing a TN off list

973
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:20,089
by reference instead of doing it by

974
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,350
value within the cert and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

975
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,550
gives you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same properties</font>

976
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,779
to prep this freshness in other words

977
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,400
you get a cert and rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than having</font>

978
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,440
like this literal block that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

979
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,440
the use of the spcs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> its the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> circuit</font>

980
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,810
is valid you could instead have a this

981
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,370
URL right that will be signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CI</font>

982
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,259
so you know it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL and you'll be</font>

983
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:38,299
an HTTPS URL so you know that it is

984
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,560
everything is properly secured for you

985
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,360
to know you're talking to replace and

986
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,940
when you do reference that you will get

987
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,460
this TN office object back from it and

988
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,840
so if it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll be getting the</font>

989
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,160
fresh version of it right now

990
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,660
unfortunately that has exactly these

991
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,670
kinds of properties that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some ways</font>

992
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,960
steven is worried about because the

993
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,670
relying party is the one that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

994
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,410
doing this and go it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> reveal some</font>

995
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,820
metadata kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about who is receiving</font>

996
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,649
calls and who they're talking to you

997
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,150
because of it depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly how</font>

998
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,070
this is architected there still is

999
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:09,290
useful metadata that can be mined from

1000
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:12,050
that so we left<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in maybe it's</font>

1001
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,880
better I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know um but</font>

1002
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,960
everything else has now been punted out

1003
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:23,090
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about those</font>

1004
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:25,130
punted approaches now I think okay yeah

1005
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:27,020
so we have two new documents haha that's

1006
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,430
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun right yes when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought we</font>

1007
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:32,090
were done we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two more asserts</font>

1008
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:33,290
related documents so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean the most</font>

1009
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,900
important thing I guess to communicate

1010
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,470
about why we're in this predicament and

1011
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,910
why freshness is important first<font color="#CCCCCC"> our is</font>

1012
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,859
the idea that once we especially be

1013
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,330
started talking about tiens themselves

1014
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,130
being effectively the subjects or

1015
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,040
certificates and especially range<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1016
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,550
blocks of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TNS suddenly you enter into a</font>

1017
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,470
new

1018
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,240
world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really matters to relying</font>

1019
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:56,359
parties whether or not assert is valid

1020
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,399
for a particular TN and you know we've

1021
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,470
since the start of this kind of agonized

1022
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,210
over this and approached it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

1023
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,580
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways how we kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of resolve</font>

1024
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,010
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of when you're relying party</font>

1025
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,980
and receive a call it's been signed for

1026
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:12,650
a particular TN<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this doesn't apply</font>

1027
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,440
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spc side of this</font>

1028
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,570
you know how do I know in real time

1029
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,000
whether or not that number hasn't been

1030
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:22,070
ported or or you know whether it has

1031
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,410
been some other structural change that I

1032
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:27,710
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of and that it requires</font>

1033
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,910
some some some either means of expiry or

1034
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,860
some means of real-time status

1035
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:33,200
verification that is going to let you

1036
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,680
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telephone numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

1037
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,549
within the scope of the authority for

1038
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:43,040
for that certificate and you know again

1039
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,680
if you're only doing spco<font color="#CCCCCC"> addis for the</font>

1040
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,029
moment is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pcs I think</font>

1041
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,140
should you then not care about this can

1042
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys all go to sleep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> during this</font>

1043
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,810
well let me try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince you not</font>

1044
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,950
because some of the approach this

1045
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,330
actually I think have interesting

1046
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:59,509
properties and you may still care about

1047
00:47:53,330 --> 00:48:00,680
them next one so there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bunch</font>

1048
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,940
of ways we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can enumerate your approach</font>

1049
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,169
certificate freshness that are familiar

1050
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry there are things like</font>

1051
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">crls there's protocols like SCDP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

1052
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,300
is not used like at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if you</font>

1053
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,860
want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about crls move approaches</font>

1054
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> crls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're welcome to write a draft</font>

1055
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,670
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the main approaches I'm</font>

1056
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,810
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in focusing on anyway our</font>

1057
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:21,530
jest ocsp and short-lived certs

1058
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,060
initially we'd say these have very

1059
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,280
different kind of privacy properties

1060
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,720
kind of the stevens point but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1061
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,030
think once we delve in and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1062
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,049
a bit more there are ways to skin both

1063
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,850
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sort of look very very</font>

1064
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,170
similar in terms of what information

1065
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">they leak and how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all comes</font>

1066
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,760
together I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I think a strong</font>

1067
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,840
preference myself or other of these yet

1068
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,970
so I'm not here to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

1069
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,890
recommendation actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think but I'm</font>

1070
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:44,509
here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is we probably need to go</font>

1071
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,549
down both these paths a little bit more

1072
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually do some specification work</font>

1073
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,180
and understand them a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more before I</font>

1074
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,380
be prepared to make a recommendation and

1075
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,850
definitely want to see this get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in</font>

1076
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,650
the field people do something with it

1077
00:48:52,850 --> 00:49:00,560
before we make a recommendation around

1078
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">neither of these next so I mean the</font>

1079
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,350
classic real-time credential validation

1080
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,640
story looks

1081
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:07,819
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

1082
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,670
typical stir in band picture where there

1083
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,870
are signers there at that intermediary

1084
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,490
you can imagine that intermediary and

1085
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the left is in Norfolk and</font>

1086
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,229
authentication service it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ultimately</font>

1087
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna emit signed requests that have the</font>

00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,120
headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our secret person before</font>

1089
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:25,340
bits and passports inside of them and

1090
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,750
then when those requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it down</font>

1091
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,430
to the verification service or

1092
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,050
potentially two end points there is

1093
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,520
going to be the staff credential

1094
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,680
validation that's going to occur you

1095
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:38,380
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term validation totally</font>

1096
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:41,480
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> real real time very good um it's</font>

1097
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it is happening at the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1098
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,100
sip requests are landing I have a

1099
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:49,010
separate picture for stapling if that's

1100
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">yours I that's great I just won't like</font>

1101
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,820
get it on the record in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web we've</font>

1102
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:57,170
tried this and it was not suitable for

1103
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:01,310
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> times it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun girls okay fair</font>

1104
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,810
enough the idea is anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1105
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:06,410
can make ocsp servers that are also

1106
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,850
going to do real-time validation but can

1107
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,170
you elaborate this is that i don't i'm

1108
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:11,710
not getting what your actual point debts

1109
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:15,410
oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean so so like in the web on</font>

1110
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:17,000
getting gear HTTPS connection and you

1111
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,589
really would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check whether the</font>

1112
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">certs been revoked before you accept the</font>

1113
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:27,050
TLS capture to do that check you cross

1114
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:30,650
with choc SP server and you're blocking

1115
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:33,940
at TLS connection and the HTS a request

1116
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:38,000
why all that ocsp can ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> bizzle and</font>

1117
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can get the Firefox staff look like</font>

1118
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,660
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail like some of the</font>

1119
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,580
double-digit percent of the time sharp

1120
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:47,600
and they time not after multiple seconds

1121
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:49,520
and like OCS Peter small the web pki

1122
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,390
infrastructure has not been able to

1123
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,550
deploy a CSP servers that are

1124
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:58,370
significantly performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have</font>

1125
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:00,170
validation please okay so look like if

1126
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,670
you're if you have tolerances and you

1127
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:04,070
can build<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ocsp infrastructure good</font>

1128
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,320
enough like maybe yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1129
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:09,860
in principle<font color="#E5E5E5"> workable but in practice of</font>

1130
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,240
the rod but but you know least agree

1131
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,920
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture at least the</font>

1132
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,060
intended architecture of Rosie SP and

1133
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,020
how it is supposed to work with this yes

1134
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,660
i'm going to show the stapling

1135
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,089
architecture like two slides

1136
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,288
but this is the classic notion of how

1137
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:21,578
the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is supposed to work right the</font>

1138
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:23,380
relying parties when they receive

1139
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:25,119
requests in this case signed requests

1140
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,220
they go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and check in real time hey</font>

1141
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,079
got this request signed by the cert in

1142
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,430
our case we've added the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrinkle of TNS</font>

1143
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,380
to it rights that say okay I got this

1144
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,910
request for this calling party<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

1145
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,190
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

1146
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,509
third say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that telephone number</font>

1147
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,460
and the scope of authority of the circle

1148
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:44,740
sign correct and you do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of as</font>

1149
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:47,230
a dip at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point yes exactly so your</font>

1151

1156
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,039
that unless you pay up your lights are

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go out that type of stuff right</font>

1158
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,589
they have a problem I'm people don't

1159
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:16,900
they gave them people get permission to

1160
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">be called at some point they change</font>

1161
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,829
their phone number they block have

1162
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:24,240
people calling plan whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to</font>

1163
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:28,210
be and then they call and then the

1164
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,770
unwitting next Oh know about my shoulder

1165
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:33,150
that number gets really upset because

1166
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,680
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fun and so there is a</font>

1167
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,539
emerging and something existing

1168
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,690
real-time infrastructure that is

1169
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:44,200
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> pub/sub when we would talk</font>

1170
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:48,010
pops up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tells people</font>

1171
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:51,069
when the last time one way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

1172
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:54,069
instant that this number<font color="#E5E5E5"> was reassigned</font>

1173
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:56,950
to somebody else doesn't say who has it

1174
00:52:54,069 --> 00:53:02,109
just simply says they were as a transfer

1175
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:05,919
or entity seen ama send in effect then I

1176
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:08,440
to that number so wonder if in practice

1177
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,869
where carrier-based validation doesn't

1178
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:14,920
work for so bad information is available

1179
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:16,990
or two masks haulers obviously and

1180
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,109
carriers they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly there's a</font>

1181
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:23,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">pimply consortium of entities and major</font>

1182
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:25,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">failures of you know I met a group of</font>

1183
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">edom and that so if wonder if in</font>

1184
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,370
practice what people will do is much

1185
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:33,360
simpler

1186
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:35,400
they look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data boys may have</font>

1187
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,310
changed since the most likely one is

1188
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:42,570
porting which is exactly hmm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

1189
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:44,370
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was ordered I do different entity</font>

1190
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,320
not just different carrier because I

1191
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,839
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've dusted the carrier</font>

1192
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,870
board give him a trust model that we

1193
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,730
have is not a high priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in a</font>

1194
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,609
sense that in the unlikely event that

1195
00:53:53,730 --> 00:54:00,420
losing carry your science for get a

1196
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:04,440
number that is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> invariably going</font>

1197
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,020
to be a mistake but not malicious for

1198
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,280
any number of reasons yeah it's unlike

1199
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,750
it actually affect our threat model are

1200
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,420
preventing personation<font color="#CCCCCC"> probable calling</font>

1201
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:14,040
about yes and so a more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is</font>

1202
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number has been completely</font>

1203
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,860
reassigned to somebody else yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1204
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,530
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some bad some</font>

1205
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:25,830
entity that it is not the same category

1206
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">as the other one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mm-hmm even though I</font>

1207
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,160
have my doubts that this actually the

1208
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,960
matter in fact is<font color="#CCCCCC"> polluting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that aside</font>

1209
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,600
so I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what were</font>

1210
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,300
people who is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> OCS be or we vocation</font>

1211
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,670
of us they'll simply do a if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1212
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,160
has changed since<font color="#CCCCCC"> these certificate has</font>

1213
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:45,510
been issued if it's a per number

1214
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:49,049
certificate then something is amiss um

1215
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:50,760
yeah sure I mean again I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a</font>

1216
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,430
lot of the same properties right as the

1217
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">crl what in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of in there people</font>

1218
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,660
push crls<font color="#CCCCCC"> midway chrome instead of ocsp</font>

1219
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,360
write effectively they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> constant</font>

1220
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">push updates a crl like it's a pub sub</font>

1221
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:07,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">um and so we all got doing in a sense of</font>

1222
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:10,430
you to show additional overhead 0 yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1223
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it's not i'm giving difficulties</font>

1224
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm all for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> punting yeah we planted in</font>

1225
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,610
the dots we have punted we're now

1226
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,850
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is i'm just curious</font>

1227
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">as but we'll find ourselves in the case</font>

1228
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be one of these</font>

1229
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">things nobody ever uses simply because</font>

1230
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem but in fact is</font>

1231
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,710
over time being at least until<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1232
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,120
signing model changes dramatically until

1233
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,120
you have per user signing and

1234
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:43,469
not well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one hundred percent</font>

1235
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:45,359
in agreement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1236
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:46,650
shortlist search because they also have

1237
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,558
side effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> poppies I think are</font>

1238
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:51,119
significant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different from this</font>

1239
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,559
so I mean I wouldn't go as far to say I

1240
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,670
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

1241
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,289
about freshness because of that because

1242
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,640
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we look at the short-lived</font>

1243
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:58,049
search approach when I get to that in a

1244
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,489
couple slides we'll talk about

1245
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:01,589
properties it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are also</font>

1246
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:06,829
useful for reasons that are that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1247
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:06,828
covered by that and tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me one time</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your original concern name of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy issue is if you can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1250
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:18,960
model that is conceptually somewhat

1251
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:22,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're essentially at least up</font>

1252
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,329
subsequent minh co l or something like

1253
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:27,359
that that avoids many of use privacy

1254
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:29,450
issues because it removes is no Colin

1255
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:32,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">commission at that point it is simply a</font>

whoever had it the number no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer does</font>

1257
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:38,579
which tells you essentially nothing yet

00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:42,479
you know because viewing or pension

verifying parties is orders of magnitude

1263
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:54,900
smaller we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have browsers doing at</font>

1264
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,969
the moment yeah then we do want the

1265
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:00,779
story arc easy azon yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know but I</font>

00:56:56,969 --> 00:57:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean forward for the next you I there a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">happen where you care about the</font>

1269
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,160
liability in real time and all of these

1270
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:14,999
other things we have a failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an</font>

1271
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:19,229
option is if you operate attend a second

1272
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:23,160
step length scales is a pub sub model or

1273
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:25,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">acol might actually be quite far more</font>

1274
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,629
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> fizzer muy avoids be real</font>

1275
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,140
time aspect in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to worry</font>

1276
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,789
about it don't have a privacy platform

1277
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,700
and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have date we already have a</font>

1278
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:40,380
dating carriers already<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracked this</font>

1279
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:42,239
stuff yep I'm round like i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said i could</font>

1280
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine there being a draft which I've</font>

1281
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,390
not written yet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be about</font>

00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">serials for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this yes it would work again</font>

1283
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:49,319
kind of like the crew model good for

1284
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:50,700
this you just assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're</font>

1285
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:52,740
creating so much venue operation

1286
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,960
environment around this especially to

1287
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,939
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shaken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah you could</font>

1288
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,190
you could define a centralized kind of

1289
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,690
crl push that would probably incorporate

1290
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,829
not just that it you referring to you

1291
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:05,730
but I've added some other data as well

1292
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:07,140
um that would you know just be sent down

1293
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:10,410
to the carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> stars what he said yeah</font>

1294
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:13,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Crispin yeah Chris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went I can't help but</font>

1295
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:15,180
bring up distributed registries photos I

1296
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,619
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking is the modern use case is</font>

00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys thinking I was like well we</font>

1298
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,470
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a modern system that like</font>

1299
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,480
spread the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> around yes but no I</font>

1300
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what you're going to get to and</font>

1301
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,500
all that's why i'll keep my comment sure

1302
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,410
it is short-lived so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna get to</font>

1303
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,800
show probably a good practical

1304
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:34,230
short-term solution because that's no

1305
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,690
you just do some nice caching

1306
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:38,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-emptive caching type of necklaces</font>

1307
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">and stuff like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and hopefully you</font>

1308
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:45,000
have a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of scamming this up</font>

1309
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:50,400
to yeah i'll let you compete yeah thanks

1310
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:53,550
yeah um no I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might capture that</font>

1311
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,869
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> investigate what crl thing</font>

1312
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,970
might look like that might actually be a

1313
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:58,200
thing to fund over to modern you should

1314
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about modern sometimes as well here</font>

1315
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,000
but not the second next slide let me

1316
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:04,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to go through real quick I</font>

1317
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,380
think we probably already talked about

1318
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,419
most of this but I mean interesting

1319
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">about ocsp is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> although it has all these</font>

1320
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,890

1321
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:16,589
party is the one who has who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1322
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:18,390
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ocsp dip of course in the web</font>

1323
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:21,150
space today people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this now</font>

1324
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,560
with stapling or instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

1325
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,930
party on the terminating side from the

00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,029
OCS PDF it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> back performed on the</font>

originating side by<font color="#CCCCCC"> signing entity and</font>

1328
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:31,560
that eliminates a lot of the privacy

1329
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,480
concerns as well and doesn't require you

1330
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,950
to take that real-time hit in any place

1331
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,170
during the call processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

1332
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,210
course on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the originating side you can</font>

1333
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,829
go acquire a staple for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that</font>

1334
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,329
you have whatever you want it whenever

1335
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:44,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need it and all that staple has to</font>

1336
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:46,290
say is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> valid for this particular</font>

1337
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:49,140
number which this call is being placed

1338
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:51,180
and because of that you know if I just

1339
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,009
if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cullen and I have my 10,000</font>

1340
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,899
numbers my enterprise I can just

1341
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,339
randomly choose the times that I go

1342
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,829
acquire my staples for these every three

1343
00:59:56,339 --> 01:00:01,020
days or whatever stagger it out so

1344
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:02,310
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no metadata that can</font>

1345
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,990
usefully be gathered from that other

1346
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,529
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know Cullen Cullen owns</font>

1347
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,939
these numbers

1348
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:08,100
and even that we could probably

1349
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,850
eliminate by just doing this over<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1350
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:13,110
TLS as well so what that so what one

1351
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,339
thing I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we were</font>

1352
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,260
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we would probably</font>

1353
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,700
actually need a way and sip to carry the

1354
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">staple that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something we've</font>

1355
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,000
defined today so it would be like some

1356
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,490
of our new protocol work we probably

1357
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,020
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a head or I imagine that</font>

1358
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,490
would actually to carry the staple along

1359
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,680
with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this we don't have that</font>

1360
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:31,169
now and that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be something</font>

1361
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,240
that's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do for sip in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

1362
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">or like some other applications do that</font>

1363
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:40,200
use certs around sip so next slide you

1364
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:42,089
know what that looks like is much more

1365
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,220
like this like you know again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1366
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:46,050
authentication service side it goes and

1367
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,730
just gets its staple and it's a

1368
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:49,380
short-lived thing right these staples

1369
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,500
you get them that to be valid for some

1370
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,060
very limited period of expiry and you

1371
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,650
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somehow carry that along</font>

1372
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,880
with the signed request and then nothing

1373
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the terminal side</font>

1374
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,910
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes any performance hits</font>

1375
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:08,670
privacy problems really<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to go back</font>

1376
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:09,960
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so short-lived credentials</font>

1377
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">like sort look certificates of course</font>

1378
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,530
begin to look exactly like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1379
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,240
this gets down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core we've now</font>

1380
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,500
skin like the two approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1381
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">end up looking more or less identical</font>

1382
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,310
ones going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is see stapling pretty</font>

1383
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,589
much you're doing the same thing you do

1384
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,990
when you do short<font color="#E5E5E5"> left certs which is</font>

1385
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,490
the authentication service side is going

1386
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:29,250
to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and acquire from biological</font>

01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">authority a short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lead cert use that and</font>

1388
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:33,000
turn to sign the request it would

1389
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,590
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to then stick that</font>

1390
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-lived certain some fashion into</font>

1391
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP traffic that goes across we know</font>

1392
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,780
how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few different</font>

1393
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,430
ways of doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again the</font>

1394
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,900
relying parties don't need to then go do

any further check with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logical</font>

1396
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,290
authority will receive it because if

1397
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,970
they trust the trust anchor and they

1398

01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last slide in fact is</font>

1401
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:59,730
that you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different party creating</font>

1402
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:03,870
the credential this one the person who

1403
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrote sir wrote this short in the OCSP</font>

1404
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:08,549
stapling model you usually have an RA or

1405
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,230
someone else doing it an and so why

1406
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:16,140
design in to a protocol an extra party

1407
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:17,940
asking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web pki people that well</font>

1408
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,629
historically this and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> business-wise</font>

1409
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

1410
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:23,519
that if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting from scratch I</font>

1411
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,598
would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing a model that had</font>

1412
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,799
one less<font color="#E5E5E5"> party that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more stable</font>

1413
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:30,480
now I'm starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear people saying</font>

1414
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,150
they like this a short-lived certs idea

1415
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,140
better on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocsp idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sucker um yeah</font>

1416
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:39,660
so so next slide the idea for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1417
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,220
issuing search begins that expire soon

1418
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,598
we you know it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth saying</font>

1419
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:45,029
what we think short-lived means in this

1420
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,819
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means hours or</font>

1421
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:49,589
days not months or years probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1422
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:51,808
would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap something more</font>

1423
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:55,410
specific around that that would be part

1424
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:56,670
of the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would do and I mean</font>

1425
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:58,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">really this seems like a no-brainer</font>

1426
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:01,470
right the only hard part of it is

1427
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:03,569
figuring out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way for you know the</font>

1428
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:06,209
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> services to get these</font>

1429
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:08,220
certs that they need on a short-lived

1430
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:10,140
basis and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know historically has been</font>

1431
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,240
hard enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do sort of get enrollment</font>

1432
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,680
and actually get certificates provision

1433
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:19,649
down into the systems that need them

1434
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:21,390
next slide but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days some people</font>

1435
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:25,890
are giving this some thought and we have

1436
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:27,390
this uh this<font color="#CCCCCC"> acme snake oil that barnes</font>

1437
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,799
and people like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are selling these</font>

1438
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:30,529
days that all the cool kids are using

1439
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:35,130
things like let's encrypt generating

1440
01:03:30,529 --> 01:03:41,339
tens of millions of certs doing this in

1441
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right and yeah i mean so this is</font>

1442
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:43,769
just based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion you kind of</font>

1443
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,390
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you're the</font>

1444
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:47,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">authentication service you're acting as</font>

1445
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:50,490
an acne clan you have like an account

1446
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:52,200
with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIA the CIA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows all of the</font>

1447
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,390
names for which you are authorized for

1448
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,819
you shoot certificates and you can you

1449
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:58,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of prove to them how</font>

1450
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:00,329
you're authorized to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that</font>

1451
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:03,209
could involve neca if we're talking

1452
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:05,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way carriers approach this and</font>

1453
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:07,349
if we're talking about weaker certs that

1454
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,538
are intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cater to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end users there</font>

1455
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:10,980
could be weaker proofs we have some

1456
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:12,839
preliminary thinking about what some of

1457
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:16,589
that might look like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have begun</font>

1458
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:19,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">to circulate next one the really</font>

1459
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting thing about this approach I</font>

1460
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:22,890
think is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like Justin end</font>

1461
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,269
user approach this this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1462
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,160
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the cause of the most</font>

1463
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:27,660
confusion when we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> shirtless</font>

1464
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">turrets we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having search</font>

01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen dude individual tiens in this the</font>

1466
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:34,590
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea behind Acme that you is in</font>

1467
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,080
administrative entity can have an

1468
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:40,290
account right with your CI basically and

1469
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,000
have a a set of names right for which

1470
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,710
you are authorized to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued</font>

1471
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,480
certificates that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just request</font>

1472
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,580
as needed means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're a</font>

1473
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,130
carrier with millions and millions of

1474
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,330
numbers under your authority you can go

1475
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,290
as you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and get these</font>

1476
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:54,150
short-lived search for just like one

1477
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:56,850
number like on a per call basis that's

1478
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">what how you want to do it right and so</font>

1479
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:02,160
what a cert for an individual TN means

1480
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,690
is not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cert for an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end user it</font>

1481
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,240
merely means I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to reveal</font>

1482
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:08,220
anything else to you other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

1483
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a cert valid for this one number</font>

1484
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,879
right I don't have to if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

1485
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,830
like revealing my<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPC's or anything I</font>

1486
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to and I constantly hear from</font>

1487
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,370
carriers who are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this man you</font>

1488
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:19,529
know I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1489
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:21,509
like analytics after the fact be able to

1490
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:23,120
ascertain like what my number<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranges and</font>

1491
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:25,890
things like that looked like like this

1492
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,470
system is designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide carries</font>

1493
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:29,879
precisely that property give you all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1494
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid freshmen stuff in the same time</font>

1495
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,600
provide this property that you can just

1496
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the fly to the degree that</font>

1497
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,190
operationally you feel it is necessary

1498
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:41,129
to do so retrieve these disposable

1499
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:44,040
instruments that let you you know n

1500
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:46,380
avoid all of those sorts of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1501
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:50,220
carrier business privacy concerns about

1502
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,990
your network in your utilization I think

1503
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really useful property even for</font>

1504
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:56,399
shakin like networks and the fact that

1505
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,859
it gives you all this freshness kind of

1506
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,300
stuff straight up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1507
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really powerful and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compelling</font>

1508
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,030
approach and I think we should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1509
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,430
try to build it outta bed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1510
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:06,840
specify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed and it dovetails with</font>

1511
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:08,370
other things we want to do with Acme and

1512
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,350
other things we want to do just it

1513
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:14,490
seemed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> general security practices</font>

1514
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:18,990
or emerging as best practices today next

1515
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:21,750
slide yeah Chris so maybe maybe I'm

1516
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:24,000
asking a question prematurely but that

1517
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:26,430
solves the acquisition part right not

1518
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,900
necessarily the distribution part you

1519
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:34,020
mean how people then acquire the sir

1520
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:36,870
except New York so I think unless I'm

1521
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:39,600
missing something I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so RC</font>

1522
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:41,580
4474 bits already has a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

1523
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:44,100
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir I'm using to sign this</font>

1524
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,720
request right so into if you're asking

1525
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,049
in terms of distribution how you get the

1526
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,910
search

1527
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:51,960
relying parties it's using the standard

1528
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:53,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">meknes since they're in 4474 pets so I I</font>

1529
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,310
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we that's pretty ill</font>

1530
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,750
it's unlike ocsp ocsp we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1531
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:59,880
need you to find like a new header it's

1532
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:01,500
like how do I carry this staple we need

1533
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,690
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some capability to carry the</font>

1534
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:08,010
staple um I think we actually got that

1535
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:09,750
covered well it'd be nice yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1536
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:13,260
this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve it but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1537
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:17,790
referring to like smart caching

1538
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:20,390
mechanisms another new sauce problem it

1539
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:24,060
does set it'd be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

1540
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:26,100
public to you both so you wanna yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1541
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:30,290
mean we could define caches and thing

1542
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,290
you know realities that are it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1543
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:36,120
sure definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again I there's a</font>

1544
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:40,590
modern story in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well what a</font>

1545
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:42,359
shocker um so what do we do well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1546
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to say let's explore both a</font>

1547
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,680
bit and see what story is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I'm not</font>

1548
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:50,250
hearing all the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go to</font>

1549
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,540
bat for doing this ocsp hear what

1550
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:59,490
everyone like to go to bat for doing

1551
01:07:51,540 --> 01:08:02,940
this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocsp here oh I would just note</font>

1552
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:06,149
that um ocsp<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not necessarily imply</font>

1553
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:10,170
the live ocsp you could do stapled ocsp

1554
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:11,970
at the Constitution<font color="#E5E5E5"> on its semantically</font>

1555
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:16,440
mostly the same as short-lived certs

1556
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:18,260
yeah I had a couple slides about that is

1557
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,818
ends unlike what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

1558
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,799
yeah if the external thing you're

1559
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:24,299
relying on those not have a certain of

1560
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,939
course you're relying parties to give a

1561
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:28,350
little big that<font color="#CCCCCC"> already holding what</font>

1562
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">button just like saying literally</font>

1563
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:36,510
verification but schnitzels<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly the</font>

1564
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">same yeah like I said we have to a</font>

1565
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,569
little work right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we don't</font>

1566
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,310
actually know how to like do OCSP

1567
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:45,359
stapling<font color="#CCCCCC"> moset they'd act like to find</font>

1568
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:48,720
some new stuff right yeah you need a

1569
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,210
little bit of her yeah you know a couple

1570
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred points like I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I I'm</font>

1571
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,609
perfectly content to try both and see

1572
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:59,309
what works but I was actually floating

1573
01:08:56,609 --> 01:09:02,130
that in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his anybody here saying</font>

1574
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:04,960
does anybody here think that that that

1575
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:06,850
ocsp is better than doing this with

1576
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,040
short the turrets with acne and that we

1577
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:13,150
should because that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely need</font>

1578
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,830
to go down the ocsp pack<font color="#CCCCCC"> halogens I mean</font>

1579
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,689
no in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I think it's quite the</font>

1580
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,880
opposite even though they might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1581
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:20,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar or OC because we might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be even</font>

1582
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,870
slightly better technically speaking I

1583
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:25,779
think from a pragmatic way of what

1584
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:27,099
people are willing to implement you have

1585
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:28,719
to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> shortland sir you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1586
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,130
implement a lifetime on the certs anyway

1587
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,450
and what that lifetime is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't change</font>

1588
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">your code and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we used to end up with</font>

1589
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:36,040
shortly of<font color="#E5E5E5"> search be much easier for</font>

1590
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to get their head around an toi</font>

1591
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:43,600
chua and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think despite my raising</font>

1592
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:49,710
these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> options like I altima tlie</font>

1593
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:52,900
improperly rear yeah more right yep

1594
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:54,069
Chris went just if it wasn't obviously

1595
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:58,269
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share of those services</font>

1596
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:59,950
probably the preference for me okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1597
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:03,670
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people over on the outer side</font>

1598
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:05,019
who were you know mary has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACME draft</font>

1599
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:15,220
now it's pretty good indication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1600
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:17,200
she's thinking yeah okay um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when we</font>

1601
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:20,190
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide let's do some real</font>

1602
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,570
time protocol design you hit no kidding

1603
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:35,559
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always how you get the real</font>

1604
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:43,120
quality stop yeah so it's time I'm do

1605
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:45,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sure um so I guess the sense</font>

1606
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room that we want to get is do</font>

1607
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,350
people want to proceed with ocsp

1608
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:55,360
short-lived sorts or something else so

1609
01:10:50,350 --> 01:11:00,910
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the short-lived certs</font>

1610
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:03,070
is the right way forward come now if you

1611
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:08,200
think ocsp is the right way forward hum

1612
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:10,719
now and if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else is</font>

1613
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,490
that we don't know what is is the better

1614
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:16,850
way forward hum now

1615
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:25,400
okay thank you know hums from the

1616
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:27,860
governor okay so while John was talking

1617
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,710
I tried to throw a quick syntax together

1618
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,530
that would solve what i heard is the

1619
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:36,080
evolved requirements it's one slide so

1620
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,059
you mail this to the list and the guts

1621
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,030
of the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just mailed to the list</font>

1622
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:43,010
for the remote attendees because i don't

1623
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:49,540
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one slide has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been posted yet</font>

1624
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:49,540
11 i'll upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the end of me ok so</font>

1625
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:57,830
the part at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top has two pieces both</font>

1626
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:59,780
of which are optional and the coop under

1627
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:00,890
it says one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the optional things must</font>

1628
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:04,099
be present or you shouldn't have done

1629
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the first part is must</font>

1630
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:12,920
include and so if that is present you

1631
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:15,710
must include<font color="#CCCCCC"> iat orage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guest and</font>

1632
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,590
whatever else is listed there if it's

1633
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:22,790
absent you still have to include iat

1634
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:24,950
orgy desk<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i think that is what i</font>

1635
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:32,030
heard is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> varmint for the first part</font>

1636
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:36,590
and the all's it is is a sequence of I a

1637
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:40,610
five strings that name the claim names

1638
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:42,830
that must be present the second part is

1639
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:44,870
the permitted values if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is</font>

1640
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:50,110
present it does what the current

1641
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:50,110
constraint does it says the named claim

1642
01:12:52,870 --> 01:13:03,410
if it is present must contain one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1643
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:09,920
values listed so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives us</font>

1644
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:11,690
both parts and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you shaking at</font>

1645
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,100
gym<font color="#CCCCCC"> demestriu the syntax up because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1646
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:16,099
didn't run it through the compiler don't

1647
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:18,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dare agreeing on this Wyatt this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1648
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of bike shedding the Wi-Fi string</font>

1649
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:23,019
instead of asking string or even utf-8

1650
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:27,099
strength why why prevent them from using

1651
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:28,989
characters we like yeah yes the sawing

1652
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:31,419
shedding it's not about your because

1653
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:33,449
that was that is what is in the draft

1654
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:39,189
that has been through the last call

1655
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:40,869
sorry I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I understand</font>

1656
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:43,479
but so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a mistake that far</font>

1657
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:45,429
don't then this is by<font color="#E5E5E5"> chatting don't go</font>

1658
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:47,799
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah there's this way Simon</font>

1659
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:59,349
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a secret</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i 85 scream get</font>

1660
01:13:47,799 --> 01:14:02,139
this far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll double bike shed I because</font>

1661
01:13:59,349 --> 01:14:04,779
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier the values would be</font>

1662
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:07,629
utf-8 and the second part seems to be

1663
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:10,029
but values not tab well that's true that

1664
01:14:07,629 --> 01:14:13,119
I did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah the values do need</font>

1665
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:17,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be right and that's that's I could</font>

1666
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:21,879
have screwed i sit that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1667
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:25,709
so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's true yeah we do</font>

1668
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:25,709
because we do want these values actually

1669
01:14:31,589 --> 01:14:38,889
like a nice communion with the real or

1670
01:14:36,729 --> 01:14:41,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">even a person's name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> escena right i mean</font>

1671
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:42,999
we're company names yeah yeah we want we

1672
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:45,699
want these to actually be international

1673
01:14:42,999 --> 01:14:48,938
high school yeah well that's that's the

1674
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:54,219
biggest change<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've made all day all</font>

1675
01:14:48,939 --> 01:15:01,809
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

1676
01:14:54,219 --> 01:15:04,989
current document says I does anyone

1677
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:07,419
think we should preserve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i5 as</font>

1678
01:15:04,989 --> 01:15:10,209
opposed to moves to you we need the i5

1679
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:12,249
to be in the header they say the i-5 we

1680
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:13,989
need thee so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i-5 strain needs to be</font>

1681
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:16,239
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the header name is right</font>

1682
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:18,308
they claim the claim name yes the claim

1683
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:21,068
name would remain I a five different

1684
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:23,260
value the permitted values in the

1685
01:15:21,069 --> 01:15:25,809
current document rio5 strings as well

1686
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:27,869
and the proposal is to make them utf-8

1687
01:15:25,809 --> 01:15:30,639
nation they need to be adjacent and

1688
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:33,518
never mind what format strings is the

1689
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:35,289
overall proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I liked it as everyone</font>

1690
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:38,290
else likes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're good without yeah I</font>

1691
01:15:35,289 --> 01:15:44,269
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get there for you</font>

1692
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good um one last thing for me and</font>

1693
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:49,130
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else we need to</font>

1694
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:52,960
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people keep telling me that</font>

1695
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need a way to do scene am and to do</font>

1696
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,250
diversion for call forwarding and this I

1697
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,500
have some graphs about this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1698
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:02,900
not generated a ton of this discussion

1699
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,000
but if regulators and people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1700
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:09,620
are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1701
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably do them so yeah I'd like I mean</font>

1702
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:14,540
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some kind of charter</font>

1703
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:16,699
ish discussion here in a minute you know

1704
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:18,110
I the charters old the milestones are

1705
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:19,759
really old there's things in the

1706
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:22,280
milestones that like we said we're going

1707
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do we never did and stuff like that I</font>

1708
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:26,630
think we should adopt some stuff like

1709
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,980
this and do whatever process structures

1710
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:31,370
are required to get these things adopted

1711
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:34,610
because people seem to need them Chris

1712
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:41,239
month plus one for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also feel is</font>

1713
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:43,250
important in yes yeah yeah these two are

1714
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:44,989
no-brainers right i mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just we just</font>

1715
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:46,610
need to have these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody</font>

1716
01:16:44,989 --> 01:16:49,309
is asking us why we didn't put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1717
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:52,280
base right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well hope I'm</font>

1718
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:59,239
in anybody think these are terrible

1719
01:16:52,280 --> 01:17:07,580
ideas we shouldn't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sit for me</font>

1720
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:11,000
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all right one second so we had</font>

1721
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:14,179
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the hour our working group</font>

1722
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,660
session in Seoul agreement in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font>

1723
01:17:14,179 --> 01:17:20,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we should add milestones towards</font>

1724
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:22,940
approaching a piece of what John was

1725
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:25,610
talking about earlier exploring the

1726
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,889
integration of acne and stir and the

1727
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation today reinforced that there</font>

1728
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:33,500
is appetite in the room to work on that

1729
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:36,830
problem any comments on that anybody

1730
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:40,300
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rush the mic in all right so we</font>

1731
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:42,620
also had agreement at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to add</font>

1732
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:45,620
whatever we needed to do to the Charter

1733
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:49,640
beat milestones or text that this group

1734
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:50,870
would work on passport extensions we've

1735
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,510
reviewed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter</font>

1736
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:55,760
turn in between and we believe that we

1737
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:58,160
can do that just with milestones that we

1738
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do charter text surgery to</font>

1739
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,730
do the passport extension stuff though

1740
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,160
it's our intent to just start to work

1741
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:07,540
with the 80s to lay down milestones to

1742
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:10,220
do passport extensions as they come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1743
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:14,480
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> just proposed a couple that there</font>

1744
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:16,940
seems to be energy to work on interest

1745
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,580
on taking on does anybody here have a

1746
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,919
problem if we approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed is about</font>

1747
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:27,019
dropping n milestones or these two

1748
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:29,030
particular extensions if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

1749
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,440
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea let me just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put and turn</font>

1750
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:31,849
this into a sense of the room home if

1751
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:35,690
you think it's a good idea we start

1752
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:40,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on this as a group um now if you</font>

1753
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:43,339
think we shouldn't come now so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1754
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:46,400
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80s to straighten out the</font>

1755
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:49,370
milestones get rid of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Croft add what</font>

1756
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:53,480
we just talked about if you don't see

1757
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:56,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happen in the next you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know two or</font>

1758
01:18:53,480 --> 01:19:02,419
three weeks please make some noise on

1759
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:05,240
the list so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the crop</font>

1760
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:07,910
one of the crust he says that we never I

1761
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,219
never started anybody was like a privacy

1762
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,470
analysis draft for this I you know I

1763
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,690
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we were helped us put</font>

1764
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">on our plate and by degrees at the time</font>

1765
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:18,019
a new charter there's like that this

1766
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,180
looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of things and with</font>

1767
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:22,070
your privacy meiosis up I might suggest

1768
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:25,160
that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to find somebody help</font>

1769
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:27,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this to do that I have a</font>

1770
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:31,070
couple people I'd like to guests for

1771
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:33,470
that so I mean it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so brother</font>

1772
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:35,330
that rather than sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes get a crop</font>

1773
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:37,640
yeah right maybe that's something you

1774
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:40,309
know I look at the stuff that's even was

1775
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,690
not me sure we came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so I me</font>

1776
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,220
know things about it yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1777
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,809
I'm the person to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've</font>

1778
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing on restaurant right so is it</font>

1779
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:49,370
me should say whether or not this is

1780
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,840
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually as a privacy screen so</font>

1781
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:53,530
let's find somebody actually at the time

1782
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,530
all right

1783
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:03,379
in the spirit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but I won't do</font>

1784
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:07,280
recently there's been a lot of interest

1785
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:10,699
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern i should say about emergency</font>

1786
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:14,239
calls roofing issues location screw

1787
01:20:10,699 --> 01:20:16,549
frame rate of things but Amelia

1788
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:18,949
locations were paying particularly as mg

1789
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:21,159
and the one starting to take off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1790
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:23,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder if there's any interest in</font>

1791
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:26,540
discussing up today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's informing</font>

1792
01:20:23,659 --> 01:20:29,059
and possibly so people might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1793
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:32,989
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at how we can</font>

1794
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:36,829
solve our old location signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

latest novel type of things I in this

<font color="#E5E5E5">context so that you had to bite or</font>

alternate approximate location or the

<font color="#CCCCCC">purported emergency call it so I'm</font>

1802
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:59,360
curious if<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any interest enforcement</font>

1803
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:01,250
yeah definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> in John again I think we</font>

1804
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,659
look at this a little bit and yeah yeah

1805
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,190
this is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a classic case</font>

1806
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:05,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I think you do a pass / extension</font>

1807
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:07,909
probably a more structured extension

1808
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:10,579
right they would allow you to capture

1809
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:12,888
the necessary location fields and so on

1810
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:15,349
but i think it's similar to see down

1811
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:16,790
like imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raid you read</font>

1812
01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:19,909
actually be the CM<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph there's kind of</font>

1813
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:21,739
a first and third party story the words

1814
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a story for how you generate the</font>

1815
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:25,820
passport object when first part is a

1816
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:27,380
testing the color name and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1817
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,969
a way to do it as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1818
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,860
station<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate a password for that</font>

1819
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:33,409
I think look you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar</font>

1820
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,449
right you probably probably have both so

1821
01:21:33,409 --> 01:21:36,949
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a list of games offline do</font>

1822
01:21:35,449 --> 01:21:40,009
what he hath you the generating the

1823
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:43,000
third party at station so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

1824
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:43,000
pretty straightforward

1825
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:52,469
Chris mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yeah that was a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1826
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have another issue that we're starting</font>

1827
01:21:52,469 --> 01:21:57,330
to look at that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font>

1828
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:00,630
valuable just going to get some feedback

1829
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it it's it is more service provider</font>

1830
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:07,710
specific but it's the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1831
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:09,719
validating a service provider validating

1832
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:12,390
telephone numbers coming from the

1833
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,580
customers that I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we service</font>

1834
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">provider themselves providing</font>

1835
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:31,050
credentials so I may provide some Sexton

1836
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:35,549
on that good<font color="#CCCCCC"> crescent but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want ya</font>

1837
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:39,690
I'm actually thinking using identity

1838
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Heather and swapping some mechanisms</font>

1839
01:22:39,690 --> 01:23:02,610
like that Michigan does I think thinning

1840
01:22:47,489 --> 01:23:04,169
I've been good all right when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we charted</font>

1841
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:07,349
this working group we identified a

1842
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:10,410
couple of large chunks of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that we</font>

would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack and we had in the</font>

1847
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:22,710
the small things we've been talking

1848
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:26,250
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> out-of-band still stands in front</font>

1853
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:40,380
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also like to suggest that</font>

1854
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,700
schedule against quick has deprived us a

1855
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:45,270
couple of you people who answered

1856
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:46,410
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways yes definitely so yeah</font>

1857
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,660
that one that was an unfortunate

1858
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:50,750
conflict but we couldn't argue that it

1859
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:55,800
was a fatal conflict so here we are

1860
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:58,620
armed some of

1861
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,480
the primary some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker in particular</font>

01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:05,010
was a major contributor to that he is

1863
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:07,410
not very busy if you believe you have

1864
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:10,380
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cycles and are willing to</font>

1865
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">take on being a driver in the form of a</font>

of work we have lab right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to do out</font>

realistically you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1883
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:06,110
interrupt right he's a virtual interim

1884
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:10,980
to accurately big into this for a day

1885
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:13,320
between now and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we do that</font>

1886

will come out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with an entry good</font>

1889
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:22,110
parts of that we're understanding better

1890
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:24,870
at this point still a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it we don't</font>

1891
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:27,480
yeah but I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot was blocking</font>

1892
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:30,030
frankly on the basic stuff inserts being

1893
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,589
stable the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of turn that we did</font>

1894
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:33,840
two roads in the last four months

1897
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:43,800

1898
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:45,720
better now where we need to get to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>
