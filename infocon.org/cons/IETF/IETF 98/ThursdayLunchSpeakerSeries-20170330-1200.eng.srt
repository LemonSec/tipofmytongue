1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,910
in the plenary we were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,000
something useful a<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,879
of the interest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IPF crowd and I</font>

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,830
mean regarding 5g that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,210
you know as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned getting a lot of</font>

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements there's going to be a lot</font>

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of work actually in the IPF going on in</font>

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,239
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 months and we thought that</font>

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know I'm cellular security would be</font>

10
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,970
good but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only basically talking</font>

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,980
about what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing regarding 5g but</font>

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,839
also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of historical background you</font>

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,660
note of you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> security was in</font>

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,550
previous cellular systems so as usual we

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,709
try to organize these things with idea

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,809
first and and Joan is actually involved

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,550
in the security groups here so we

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it was a basically no good</font>

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:53,290
arrangement so John please yeah thank

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so low that nice introduction so</font>

21
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,560
this will be about sellers security it

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,989
will be about network<font color="#CCCCCC"> security only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,049
about the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer if you think</font>

24
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:09,370
your Wi-Fi network then you know what

25
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:13,060
this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will be about 3gpp</font>

26
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,850
cellular systems only used to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:21,940
of competing standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now with LTE</font>

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:25,889
and 5g its<font color="#E5E5E5"> GDP only so this presentation</font>

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,780
will be in basically into<font color="#E5E5E5"> pouch one</font>

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,260
historical patch going through how the

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">security 20 PP seller systems have</font>

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:41,020
evolved from the analog bagni systems to

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:45,970
gsm 2 3g and 4g and the second part will

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:48,399
be quite focused on young quick story of

35
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:55,689
some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry is</font>

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:02:01,450
driving in 5g so starting from the

37
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:04,020
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been one</font>

38
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">generation cellular system each ten</font>

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,170
years so first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> key systems they were</font>

40
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,510
launched in around nineteen eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

41
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,510
complete analog and the

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,920
basically new security conservation when

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:24,620
they weren't made the analog she could

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,730
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily it's dropped on them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:32,150
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ordinary radio that could turn</font>

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,590
in the right frequency and basically the

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:40,010
cha-ching was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> patron sent its ID in</font>

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,159
clear text in an effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> short out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

49
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,929
right field so anybody picking

50
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,899
eavesdropping on the ID and being able

51
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:55,180
to reprogram the phone could call<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:58,159
free on someone else bill and

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,269
development of the next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> G system</font>

54
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,940
started quite soon after in 82 and as a

55
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,010
comparison I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mountain EPP</font>

56
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:14,299
things here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

57
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:18,290
deaths was publicity 77 so 2g completely

58
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:22,040
digital but still circuit-switched not

59
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:27,198
packet switched patootie there was a

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,940
large security focus but still the main

61
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,750
goals was to fix the problems with

62
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,989
bungee and make it as secure as a fixed

63
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:39,109
home it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended as a</font>

64
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:42,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">military-grade secure communication and</font>

65
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,379
it was probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mass-market</font>

66
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:49,488
communication system with cryptography

67
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:52,910
in the word very widely deployed and

68
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:57,079
this was not appreciated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intelligence</font>

69
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:00,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">Agency another thing fun thing jeezum is</font>

70
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,919
still after<font color="#CCCCCC"> running and will be for many</font>

71
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:09,919
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it was deployed expecting a</font>

72
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:15,079
tongue 10 years life span and gsm boss

73
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:18,799
Sanderson 87 deployed in 1990 and you

74
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:24,169
can see that was way way before SSL or

75
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:28,099
example Wi-Fi with web which was ten

76
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:35,210
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and extremely lesyk</font>

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:40,340
less secure than gsm this is how

78
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:43,039
authentication in GG gsm looks like the

79
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,469
phone has the phone on a network has a

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,350
shared secret they're called k a

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:52,940
symmetric key the phone sense its

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:56,750
identity called MC to network and this

83
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:59,930
is something clear this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem you</font>

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,780
can track this identity dsm<font color="#E5E5E5"> used on</font>

85
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,520
temporary identity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can force the</font>

86
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,039
phone to reveal its long-term identity

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,490
the whole networks on some random number

88
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,670
and the authentication check<font color="#CCCCCC"> any key to</font>

89
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">run the numbers down to the phone the</font>

90
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,720
phone calculate this authentication

91
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,850
string and his MSC new compares the

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">values caught from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the film and valued</font>

93
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,160
code from the home network see if the

94
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,010
film is authenticated then the phone

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,690
derives this key<font color="#E5E5E5"> casey and you have</font>

96
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,400
encryption between the film and the base

97
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,440
station i will point out this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,060
long time ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody really knew how to</font>

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,980
make secure authentication and

100
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,700
negotiation protocols so one thing is

101
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the MC something clear text another</font>

102
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,159
is that the negotiation is not

103
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:03,369
integrated protected they are with

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:07,070
negotiation a third thing is that the

105
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:14,540
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key derivation does not</font>

106
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:18,770
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cycler albert and and maybe</font>

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,710
the largest weakness is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's only</font>

108
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client phone that is authenticated</font>

109
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:28,609
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is not authenticated and we</font>

110
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,270
will talk about how what was most of

111
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,270
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things have been fixed to the gsm</font>

112
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:39,799
was designed in a completely different

113
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">hi photography was seeing us for a long</font>

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,910

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">bite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us do you use it was also no clear</font>

117
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,640
definitions of what consisted strong

118
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,130
cryptography yes that strong cryptic

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,070
cryptography was not allowed to export

120
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,400
there's very different rules for example

121
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:09,610
in the US and the European Union this

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,320
became much clearly in 97 96 with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

123
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:18,100
decimal agreement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even here around</font>

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,030
this time it was basically 56 Orion

125
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,700
proved to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> teeth within orb and this</font>

126
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,830
applies for two for example deaths and

127
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:32,440
also for gsm he some<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses late dyeables</font>

128
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:36,250
are designed for 64 bits but they are

129
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:41,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">short-term 256 this was in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Western</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">world for exporting to third countries</font>

131
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,740
development concrete industry was forced

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,250
to introduce a weak version of the cyber

133
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:56,680
called a pipe tube with limited security

134
00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,040
and these are words were not publicly

135
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,370
reviewed this was not possible to use

136
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:10,360
way too slow mobile phones of this time

137
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:12,490
needed something much much faster and to

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,890
my knowledge the reason to have been

139
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,190
secret was that basically they were

140
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:25,090
deployed so anybody founding weaknesses

141
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:34,539
on them do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them positive next</font>

142
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:37,419
me I'm 10 years into and 3d and<font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font>

143
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,899
here a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the weaknesses in GSM was</font>

144
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:45,329
known to the main goal in Trinity

145
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:48,490
security was to fix weaknesses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM</font>

146
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:51,489
one thing is mutual authentication with

147
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,370
some replay protection the signaling is

148
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,980

and 2014 both dev aslam's want a is

after yeah basically one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

199
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:45,640
design goals for LT was to never reuse

200
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,650
the same key twice basically you drive a

201

new key depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which I'll go to</font>

202
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:53,709
use you drive a new key depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

203
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:57,040
which node it is and when you do

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,670
any key is does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allow an attacker to</font>

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,330
some other key and in the handovers LTE

212
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,110
provides both forward and backward

213
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:37,510
secrecy so that then you knew you cannot

<font color="#E5E5E5">derive the keys from the previous</font>

you've added some extra additions

theoretical speculation that snow could

cellular networks to be insecure I think

308

484
00:32:48,220 --> 00:33:00,640
trees and the and to mitigate the

485
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,740
problem with MC captures basically the

486
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,799
problem is that a identity is something

487
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,380
clear text and when it's not you can

488
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:13,080
force the film to reveal its identity

489
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:16,510
and if I obvious solution to that is to

490
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,960
encrypt the identity with a public key

491
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:22,658
in the home network and this is possible

492
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,200
today it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not have been</font>

493
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:30,539
possible when gsm was standardized the

494
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:34,630
phones back then could not do public key

495
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:38,350
crypto in with any good latency it would

496
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:40,690
have taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to way too much time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

497
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,639
you would have maybe waited ten seconds

498
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:48,429
to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your call that would not be</font>

499

500
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:56,440
like something like this probably the

501
00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:00,370
whole network will see that have it you

509
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:32,440
have a private key why the user

attack you would see is which home

this will basically mitigate MC captures

improvements of the mobile handset to

00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,240
the base station covered in a 5g but I

698
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,370
understand it the next generation of

699
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,229
attacks are already happening on the ss7

700
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,029
and interface station communication and

701
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything to say about what's in</font>

702
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,470
the store for projecting base station to

703
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,370
base station or base station to network

704
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:52,919
yeah ss7 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am not talked about</font>

705
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:56,799
application they are not about the

706
00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:02,290
carrier net connecting different porch I

707
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:04,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> ss7 is even older protocol than</font>

708
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:08,140
these there's a large number of

709
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:12,250
vulnerabilities there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot</font>

710
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:15,250
several studies looking how you can fix

711
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">these perfect the answer is that you</font>

712
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:21,580
probably count with backward comp

713
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:26,050
abilities I think you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replace</font>

714
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:27,850
them or yeah and that takes time I think

715
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:30,580
one of the main problem was that you

716
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">could access there's a certain network</font>

717
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:36,759
online on the internet from so yeah it's

718
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:40,750
on places and that of course made it

719
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:45,580
very insecure I think these problems are

720
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:48,820
now mainly them fixed making ss7 it

721
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:53,670
still has insecurities but at least it's

722
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,670
much harder to access them further body

723
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:59,450
endings for joining me one question in

724
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:04,150
terms of kind of a fake base station

725
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,890
problem that as you have roaming on

726
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:09,920
international roaming in particular how

727
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:13,270
would a handset know which are good

728
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,380
networks in which a bad networks so I

729
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:20,180
Roman to country a visit I have no idea

730
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:23,450
what my mind's not none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my home</font>

731
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:26,629
network and a rogue<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network happily will</font>

732
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:29,299
offer to serve me and how would I know

733
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:32,600
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how would the device</font>

734
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:35,450
reasonably know which networks just pour

735
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,940
it come on is there a mechanism intended

736
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:39,799
that I can discover that right now it

737
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,580
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the case yeah in a</font>

738
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,920
sense is what if I know Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4G if a</font>

739
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:49,460
network will let me on my device will

740
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:52,760
happily join it yeah but in port if you

741
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">use 4G or 3d then the network is</font>

742
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,180
actually authenticated so well you know

743
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:02,300
what it is but I mean when I warm to

744
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:05,390
some country that I don't know yeah mine

745
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,370
I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he's network names are</font>

746
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,770
meaningless to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know yeah I know</font>

747
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:11,900
second literally yesterday somebody who

748
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:16,160
has not my best<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest ecology yeah</font>

749
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:18,500
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 or 40 then you</font>

750
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,390
can trust that at least your home

751
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:26,330
operator which you hopefully trust has

752
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:29,150
trust this operator and allow your phone

753
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,799
to connect to it so Israel currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

754
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,110
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> addressed don't know is there</font>

755
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,960
currently a mechanism in place that the

756
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Houma operate a whitelist sleaze network</font>

757
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:43,370
stuff on me now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

758
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">what if I my sim college doesn't go I</font>

759
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a channel to ask my home</font>

760
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,300
operator at that moment when I'm

761
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:53,000
connecting I yeah it's basically when

762
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are connecting to this network that</font>

763
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,500
you don't know then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network too</font>

764
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:01,370
babe you're prone to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

765
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,560
with the roaming network has to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

766
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:06,410
you whom operator and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> whom operated</font>

767
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,910
needs to allow your poem to connect to

768
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,190
this

769
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,690
George it is it has to talk to your home

770
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,869
network because otherwise it won't get

771
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">your king material otherwise it cannot</font>

772
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:19,780
authenticate itself to your phone and

773
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:22,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">your poem would react it so that you</font>

774
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:25,480
could film connects to trade your gmat

775
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:28,960
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that this network has</font>

776
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:33,789
been authorized by your home operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2g</font>

777
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:39,579
there is no operator so then you don't

778
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">know anything you name the young can you</font>

779
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:52,859
screw up to the place use cases which

780
00:50:46,690 --> 00:51:01,200
was that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok or yeah yeah yeah so I</font>

781
00:50:52,859 --> 00:51:04,930
see a in 5g the verticals probably a

782
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,230
very important the use cases so is there

783
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:15,069
any special requirements in the security

784
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:22,180
for this year's case week you<font color="#E5E5E5"> jest a for</font>

785
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">example in the tripod transport it yeah</font>

786
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:28,839
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the the main thing here</font>

787
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:31,750
is one main requirement is latency but

788
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:35,099
that's not security-related what the

789
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:39,190
security related come from that they be

790
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:42,789
the bus needs the course needs to talk

791
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:46,960
to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars directly so then you need</font>

792
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:49,869
to have a key change your kid duration

793
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,680
in neck in place so that the course can

794
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:56,890
authenticate themselves to other cars

795
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:59,950
and be sure that they are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to who</font>

796
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:03,250
they are talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and that they</font>

797
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:06,520
get command from the right but today<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

798
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:08,890
communication is user<font color="#E5E5E5"> click temp base</font>

799
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,369
station yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to implicate</font>

800
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:14,410
that so the main security thing here is

801
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:17,049
that course should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

802
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:20,870
authenticate to each other when they are

803
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:24,360
using 5g to communicate

804
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:27,630
in this case easy and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew mechanism</font>

805
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,950
when you to intrude introduced to to

806
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:35,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">catch this kind of us at authentication</font>

807
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:38,450
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah there's definitely new</font>

808
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,690
protocols and new<font color="#E5E5E5"> key derivation but</font>

809
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:44,040
hopefully they should work with

810
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,440
irrespectively on what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

811
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,020
credentials you used to authenticate to

812
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so you authenticate and then</font>

813
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,860
you would get keying material to

814
00:52:51,630 --> 00:53:01,250
authenticate to other course yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

815
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,250
new protocols definitely needed yeah

816
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Huijin from your presentation you</font>

817
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,030
introduce there'll be some changes

818
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:11,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">between security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design between the ue</font>

819
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:13,260
and the core network so I wondering is

820
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,600
also is going to be some changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

821
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,150
in the backhaul network<font color="#CCCCCC"> to indo p in the</font>

822
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">core network so right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my something</font>

823
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:23,730
that's for geog using IPSec to increase

824
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,500
traffic is having change to that or I

825
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:30,800
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the Lord changes is that</font>

826
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already happening is that</font>

827
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:38,520
everything is getting virtualized so

828
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:40,440
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you before you had you had a</font>

829
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,830
radio encryption and then you have

830
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,110
optionally IPSec when everything stopped

831
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:51,210
getting virtualized you have you have

832
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the nose divided from hardware even the</font>

833
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,160
base station will be wrong hotly in

834
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware often the access network</font>

835
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,830
importantly in the cloud and then you

836
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:04,950
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a GLS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Conlogue between</font>

837
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:08,150
these so you will probably have several

838
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:12,180
layers of security will probably have

839
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:15,600
maxik security ipsec<font color="#E5E5E5"> NT lesson maybe</font>

840
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,910
application layer security also<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank</font>

841
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> John um just like three minutes to</font>

yeah sure and the next session<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ops</font>

stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> here are the things that verily it</font>

851
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:47,400
is then large number of messages that

852
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually received by the forum free</font>
