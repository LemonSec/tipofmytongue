86
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,229
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plan is initially for a DS to</font>

87
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,239
play with the interface and see how it

88
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:59,200
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to request documents and</font>

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,630
work this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to manage and</font>

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I can more intelligently talk to a</font>

94
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,380
potential secretary once we recruit one

95
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:21,700
about how much work it is what's

96
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:25,060

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,890

98
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,740
in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to do</font>

99
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,099
reviews of documents say one document of

100
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,159
mine

101
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,159
for the to help out the area directors

102
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:45,310
write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names quickly okay III</font>

103
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,300
think well we'll need to do a bit more

104
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,609
recruiting but that's somewhat promising

105
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,609
it was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I am impressed</font>

about the rice I Directorate which is

110
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,860
not being used so our art is going to be

111
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:26,710
the joint thing but if you have opinions

112
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,710

114
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:37,900
how this is going to work but I think a

115

149
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,520
here of thanking outgoing area<font color="#E5E5E5"> directors</font>

150
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,530
in the right area and now the arc area

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,329
with sort of celebrating with gifts

152
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,630
along a theme the theme we've arrived at

153
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:48,390
this year is music and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to kick that</font>

154
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:52,320
off I've have this classic Miles Davis

155
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">album kind of blue this is presented on</font>

156
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,530
behalf of the ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group which is</font>

157
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,199
not meeting this week they delegated<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

158
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,880
to present this now um they presented me

159
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,710
with this and I think John Peterson

160
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,170
suggested we focus on final as the

161
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,960
median here um but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't sure exactly</font>

162
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,520
how to turn it into sound since Apple

163
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,230
decided to remove the physical media

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,699
slots from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their laptops in a while ago</font>

165
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,130
so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a good cullen</font>

166
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,200
then and Tim have another theory here so

167
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:34,470
on behalf of about the dispatch group

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:36,440
bomb<font color="#E5E5E5"> tempest cow yeah so so over in the</font>

169
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,790
codec working group we we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

170
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,340
thought the idea of music was a great

171
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,949
one and and vinyl was an excellent

172
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,220
choice but what Richard rightly pointed

173
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,870
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alyssa might need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> record player to</font>

174
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,380
play her records because probably didn't

175
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,550
already have one and and so so we

176
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,740
thought you know we could give some

177
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,199
recommendations of reddit<font color="#CCCCCC"> audio file</font>

178
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,540
approved record players but but somehow

179
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just didn't seem good enough it</font>

180
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,410
didn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really represent true</font>

181
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,660
leveraging of the work we do here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> art</font>

182
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:23,390
so we said what if we made a record

183
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:27,180
player that streams opus over WebRTC so

184
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,470
if they can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> unpacks this is the</font>

185
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">only reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we needed it to an a half</font>

186
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:39,680
hour slot this morning we have we have

187
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:44,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's in last call mounted a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi</font>

188
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,339
inside this record player on it is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

189
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:51,149
feeding USB audio off of the record

190
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,310
players internal internal a 2d and then

191
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:59,670
it connects back out through ethernet on

192
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:07,670
it also supports Wi-Fi so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we plug</font>

193
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:07,670
this thing in here it's completely safe

194
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,920
on so get given a moment to come up and

195
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,810

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is the ITF administrative</font>

325
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:54,039
support activity it's the word we use to

326
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe how we administer the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and</font>

327
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,779
the way we do it now was established

328
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,730
about more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've</font>

329
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,649
been starting a community discussion

330
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,789
about changes we might want to make

331
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,939
challenges we're facing as an

332
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:08,408
organization from an administrative and

333
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,879
funding perspective so we're having a

334
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday afternoon about</font>

335
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:16,748
some of those things we had we have a

336
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with a workshop report that</font>

337
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,779
describes some of the problems we're

338
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,539
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing that and and next</font>

339
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:23,889
steps in the community discussion so if

340
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:25,419
you care about how the IETF is

341
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:27,998
administered or what its fundraising

342
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:31,990
situation looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> please come to is a</font>

343
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:35,080
judo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we won't say anything about</font>

344
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,470
coordinated address spaces or keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

345
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,580
excellent then and two new ring groups

346
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,259
have formed since South Korea<font color="#CCCCCC"> J map I</font>

347
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:51,129
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexei can certainly talk to Jim a</font>

350
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,269
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that yeah Jay map is mostly</font>

351
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:59,649
an attempt to create an email protocol

352
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:01,299
that means that people don't spend the

353
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:04,119
first six months of developing a new

354
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:06,429
client and trying to understand 30

355
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,789
different standards and discovering that

356
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:12,909
this random support for them and then

357
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:14,019
give up that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much it what do</font>

Joe Hildebrand so yeah we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sea</font>

362
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,408
border working group that's doing three

363
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,330
things number one moving the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seaboard</font>

364
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:31,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">spec along towards proposed standard fix</font>

365
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,320
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of myths that sort of thing</font>

366
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:37,190
number two talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the possibility</font>

367
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,870
of standardizing some extra features

368
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">extra tags that sort of thing number</font>

369
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:45,199
three and the part that may be more

370
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,940
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in this room is</font>

371
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
looking at standardizing a definition

372
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,879
language that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been used to</font>

373
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:58,379
specify either see<font color="#E5E5E5"> bore or JSON messages</font>

374
00:26:53,879 --> 00:27:00,209
in protocols and that's c DD l or cuddle

375
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:02,100
is the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that protocol that we're</font>

376
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,869
using as a starting point for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

377
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:10,009
discussion so come thursday afternoon at

378
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:10,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">1300 to have that discussion</font>

379
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:39,170
order thank you I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not picky you gonna</font>

380
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:44,350
and I am wanting this is so can you hear

381
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:53,110
me yes and next slide please so why this

382
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:57,230
draft so I stated LFC 2756 and Alexis

383
00:27:53,110 --> 00:28:03,020
3550 clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> states that we should not</font>

384
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:05,630
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we should not send packet that</font>

385
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,470
are bigger than the NTU because

386
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,630
augmentation is bad if augmentation is

387
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,860
bad on the first link layer is probably

388
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:20,980
bad as we're so the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this dart is</font>

389
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:23,929
to reuse the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol we just finish</font>

390
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:27,800
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> call hopeless coatings at</font>

391
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:30,980
home working<font color="#CCCCCC"> all which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft IDF</font>

392
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,040
Constantine Hildy which is itself an

393
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,860
implementation of a chief of ta21 which

394
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,750
is used to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path and tu for</font>

395
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:47,590
protocol would do not have a mechanism

396
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:54,740
to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> path empty next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so</font>

397
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:58,250
what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need so this is can order of</font>

398
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:04,850
that unpacked a lot from<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot of</font>

399
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:07,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in art so we need guidance to</font>

400
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:12,649
find what is the best way to collect

401
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifiers for ftp tcp vachetta we need</font>

402
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:22,430
an additional attribute in sdp to signal

403
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:26,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the server is capable on online kim</font>

404
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">2d discovery app' Guetta and we probably</font>

405
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,730
need some guidance from the ice expert

406
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:37,070
because this is a pocket or which is

407
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:41,140
running alongside so although I stuff

408
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:45,879
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> already a lot of stuff so next</font>

409
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:49,090
slide so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that is a first</font>

410
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,360
any interest in this in this draft is a

411
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:55,000
nice to polarize this and if yes we

412
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:58,540
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to to</font>

413
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,610
make progress just like so my question

414
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,020
is if you're running this long side is

415
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,399
why do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an RTP in the</font>

416
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:12,280
first place when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just a path MTU</font>

417
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:15,310
discovery in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice channel if first is</font>

418
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,730
not only ice right we may want to use it

419
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:21,960
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> see for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cases is not</font>

420
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:24,850
using us so it's kind of a more generic

421
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,040
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we still probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

422
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,399
have some guidance when it's used with

423
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,510
ice I mean mines my suggestions advice I

424
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,150
mean I seems like a much more natural

425
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,580
protocol for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of as an</font>

426
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,200
extra you know since the purpose of the

427
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,689
ice cognitive of the ice is to figure

428
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,580
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport characteristics I would</font>

429
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,160
say if you're using is it for natural

430
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,570
but I could certainly see use cases you

431
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,070
know when you're doing RTP without ice

432
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:52,179
but it seems less compelling and at

433
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">which point if you're doing that you</font>

434
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,820
might want to think about which it gets

435
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:02,410
a lot harder of course some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

436
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:06,129
multicast cases of RTP yes it's not with

437
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">am Mooji casting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not yes probably a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

438
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,550
idea to power surge this yes yeah so

439
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,909
someone Thompson I'm I'm kind of with

440
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:18,990
Jonathan only on the ice suggestion

441
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:21,580
frankly I don't think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multicast</font>

442
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,340
scenarios are going to be tractable in

443
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,500
any particular way if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go off</font>

444
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,530
and solve that problem it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

445
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:34,600
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research projects required</font>

446
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:38,830
before that happens I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of RTP</font>

447
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:41,889
usage now is is tied to ice and fixing

448
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:46,120
the problem there is both simpler and

449
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:51,700
easier so i would suggest just sticking

450
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:53,020
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Erica scorer on +1 to that</font>

451
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,429
also it's worth observing that in many

452
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,649
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> their other protocol</font>

453
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,590
co-located with RTP over ice and those

454
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:04,899
have their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> p MTU discovery problem</font>

455
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:07,299
so um be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sevilla be huh d GLS NSE TB and</font>

456
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,830
being able to simply inform them of the

not sure because I ctp has his own<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

460
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:18,999

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply tell it what is PMT was that</font>

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,029
new discovery kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks so the few</font>

466
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,279
times you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I'm you either</font>

467
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,289
you have to burn actual packets which

468
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,119
you want to send or you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> burn</font>

469
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,559
them with by sending bogus packets so

470
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,240
let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once rather than rather</font>

471
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,350
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> end times and I'm also kind of</font>

472
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,529
curious how we're gonna do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with how</font>

473
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,629
it's gonna interact with bumble yes this

474
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:45,399
is why we need advice forum<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

475
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,509
because I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was econ is right my</font>

476
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,309
point is that if you simply adapt

477
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:53,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Johnson suggestion and use ice all those</font>

478
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:56,139
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away yes so we when we</font>

479
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:58,509
fought about this about ice thing is

480
00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:02,189
that we don't need it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS because</font>

481
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls is using its only father Jean shows</font>

482
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,409
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning and that this is srgb</font>

483
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,360
so we don't have to do path discovery

484
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:13,509
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application data because there</font>

485
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,119
is no application data and then we don't

486
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:22,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">need it for SC TPP because I ctp has its</font>

487
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:24,879
own what<font color="#E5E5E5"> path discovery mechanism so why</font>

488
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:28,090
do it twice so but it could be a good

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> puffins to you up yeah yeah yeah</font>

491
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:37,480
sometimes an echo sort of reminded me of

492
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,490
a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you absolutely probably</font>

493
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,519
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in the RTP layer is</font>

494
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,869
it you are running out for ice you lose

495

message up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so it seems</font>

523
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,890
pretty strong advice here to go try and

524
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how to do this at the ice</font>

525
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,118
layer and to the RTP layer is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

526
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:22,509
reasonable way for you moving forward

527
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:26,349
you see any John Lennox I mean if there

528
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,390
are compelling use cases for RTP without

529
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:33,940
ice then we can look at this but so far

530
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:38,049
I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard any I said I</font>

531
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">think most you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the modern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

532
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:43,538
I'd say most of the articulate Isis

533
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,250
either VoIP which isn't likely to

534
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,900
implement something new like this at

535
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,759
this point especially because audio

536
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,420
doesn't really attempt to you issues or

537
00:35:48,759 --> 00:36:01,319
else like IPTV which<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the</font>

00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:03,700
multicast areas all right yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonzalo</font>

539
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to try and understand</font>

540
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,029
if there's work for us to actually do

541
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,690
meaning it's fine for us to redirect and

542
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:12,009
work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a nice problem it just is</font>

543
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:17,140
their interest in actually solving the

544
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:19,119
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think I would no one</font>

545
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,910
spoke in favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> really of solving this</font>

546
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,920
problem so unless somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

547
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,788
this work forward versus solving the

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,440
problem with ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we will sort of</font>

549
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:36,720
into this dispatch for a bit said<font color="#E5E5E5"> turnah</font>

550
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thank you</font>

551
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:43,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the the the sort of the</font>

552
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:45,368
conclusion should be you know encourage

553
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:46,868
people to perceive looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

554
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:55,479
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at the ice layer it said</font>

555
00:36:46,869 --> 00:37:02,729
the RTP later for now that wonder we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

556
00:36:55,479 --> 00:37:02,729
next I think we are a few web link

557
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:17,950
mark yeah

558
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:36,738
good morning um so a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago in an</font>

559
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:39,950
ITF far far away we had a document RFC

560
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:42,499
598 this or sorry 598<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so used to</font>

561
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,589
saying this at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> now about web</font>

562
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:48,499
linking and next slide and this is a

563
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:51,349
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> that defines kind of the</font>

564
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:52,729
generic concept of what it means to link

565
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:55,880
from one resource to another on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

566
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:58,819

567
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,059

568
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:04,759
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in HTML other places and</font>

569
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:07,220
it defines this model in a somewhat

570
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:09,529
rigorous fashion and it also defines a

571
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,410
way to serialize this model into HTTP

572
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:14,359
headers and that was the the driving

573
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,970
force for that specification because it

574
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,229
had been kind of half specified way way

575
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,819
way back in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of the web</font>

576
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,808
and then dropped to the floor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

577
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:24,140
figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually was quite</font>

578
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:27,950
useful and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted a formal</font>

579
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:30,288
specification for it next slide and so

580
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:32,598
this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked up by a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

581
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:37,190
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> communities it's used in core</font>

582
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:40,999
it's used in HTML sorry acne acne uses

583
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,289
it awesome yay it's an atom it was kind

584
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,779
of derived from some work we didn't Adam

585
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:47,239
way back when the json-ld folks in the

586
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:50,329
Semantic Web folks use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for stuff</font>

587
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:53,960
that they do and it's the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquid</font>

588
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:55,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">but of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes and it's used in a lot</font>

589
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,469
of other places it's kind of one of

590
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:59,420
those foundational specs that doesn't

591
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,999
get a lot of attention but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it helps</font>

592
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:05,690
build some structure and other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

593
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:07,279
and and so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this spec it was</font>

594
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:10,130
something that I did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my spare time</font>

595
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:12,619
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was 80 sponsored because way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

596
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,150
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of how things were</font>

597
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,489
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexi were you the idea that</font>

598
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:20,869
sponsored it but Bevin i really forget

599
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:23,180
who it was it is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible yeah but</font>

600
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so it went out there and it got</font>

601
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,118
adopted by these communities and was

602
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:31,368
good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it SAT there for a while and uh</font>

603
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,519
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime you know once it became</font>

604
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:37,440
you sorry it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexia thank you Thank</font>

605
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">You</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laxing so that makes the more recent</font>

606
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,780
sations a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> ironic than okay</font>

607
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,450
it's been adopted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've found some</font>

608
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,660
some issues in it some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them small and</font>

609
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,399
some of them large and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started a rep</font>

610
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,049
oh just to track that and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

611
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,150
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our replacement document</font>

612
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,420
again on the back burner kind of on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

613
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:00,359
own time and that got some attention

614
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,069
from a lot of those communities probably

615
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than I intended and we had a lot of</font>

616
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:07,259
long discussions in the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed</font>

617
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that rep oh so next slide this is a</font>

618
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,079
short link to that issues list if if you

619
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,029
want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a look at the issues</font>

620
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,520
there I'll summarize the high points in

621
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,260
just a moment but we had a long set of

622
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,839
discussions about them and got to a

623
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,420
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where everyone was pretty happy or</font>

624
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,190
at least from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I could see and so</font>

625
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,690
the document has settled down there

626
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,579
aren't any open issues on it currently

627
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,640
and we think it's it's pretty ready to

628
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,589
go I do have some discussions that I

629
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,480
want to have with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ayanna about how the</font>

630
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:40,230
interaction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them works but that's</font>

631
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,359
about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's left so next slide um</font>

632
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,369
there's a lot of little stuff and as

633
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,680
abyss document this is entirely you know

634
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">appropriate I think we did things like</font>

635
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,680
clarifying terminology cutting down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

636
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,390
introduction and making more human

readable updating all the references

638
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,879
incorporating all the errata most of

639
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,170
those from julie and i think hi Julian

640
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,430
we remove the registration template

641
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,780
since they've served their purpose and

642
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,480
they took up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

643
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,180
document updated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EA BNF thank you</font>

644
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,040
again Julian and we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

645
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,660
non-normative algorithm for parsing link

646
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,550
headers in the style of the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

647
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:15,328
group because that's what the cool kids

648
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:16,920
do today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we define these concepts of</font>

649
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:18,780
an application of linking and a

650
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,420
serialization of linking more carefully

651
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,240
these are kind of the ways that you

652
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,040
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> express a link in C realisations</font>

653
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,930
as well as things that use links the

654
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,349
applications and what constraints or

655
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:34,799
guidelines we give<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those things um</font>

656
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:37,680
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit bigger of an</font>

657
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,690
issue that actually at one point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

658
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,368
was a bit controversial folks in the

659
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,819
Semantic Web world wanted a lot more

660
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">rigor around how to create a uri for a</font>

661
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:48,839
registered link relation so we have a

662
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,890
registry of lincra link relations in

663
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,259
just a short token you know for neck

664
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:56,848
or home or what's of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

665
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:59,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">we use as a shorthand but the actual</font>

666
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:02,250
extension syntax for link relations is a

667
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:05,319
folio I so it's grounded in a namespace

668
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,940
and so these folks wanted a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:09,099
express those shorts registered

670
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,049
relations as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are eyes which the spec</font>

671
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:12,910
didn't do terribly well it kind of waved

672
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tens about it and so we had a long</font>

673
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,848
back and forth about how best to do that

674
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we think we've come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to a place</font>

675
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:21,039
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a reasonable approach to</font>

676
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,799
that that makes everyone not unhappy and

677
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,029
so in discussions that I had with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lexie</font>

678
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:26,259
in the background about doing this this

679
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:28,420
document this was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns</font>

680
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,339
was that if that blows up that might

681
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,940
require a working group to sort it out

682
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:37,269
but it's not blowing up anymore so next

683
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,650
slide um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other big thing that that's</font>

684
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of happening the background of this</font>

685
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,059
draft which which you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really get a</font>

686
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,549
good sense of from reading it is is that

687
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:49,510
we personally want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and experiment</font>

688
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:51,730
with how we run the registry in that you

689
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the registry right now is quite</font>

690
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,839
clunky and how its run and it's not very

691
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,000
friendly to end users who aren't

692
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,730
familiar with IETF process and this is a

693
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of recurring theme in in what we do</font>

694
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,150
here we have certain numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

695
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,180
registries whose audience is not just

696
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:09,309
protocol folks at the ITF it's a much

697
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,690
much wider audience of developers and

698
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:12,160
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact with these</font>

699
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,200
registries in a more friendly fashion

700
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,180
and so there's been some thinking put

701
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,299
into how can we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and how can we</font>

702
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,788
establish those procedures I think the

703
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:23,740
insight that that I'm currently

704
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:25,990
operating under which which may or may

705
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,939
not be disabused is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font>

706
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,129
to document all of those procedures in

707
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,619
the RFC what's important is we document

708
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,420
the relationship between the registry

709
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:37,000
and the experts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and iono to make sure</font>

710
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,970
that they can evolve a structure that

711
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,289
works but that's one of the discussions

712
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think still needs to happen a</font>

713
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:45,250
little bit more publicly at least in

714
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:47,619
this community is there a next slide I'm

715
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,009
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next line okay thanks</font>

716
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:52,809
so um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're at they're like</font>

717
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:54,369
I said there aren't any open technical

718
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:55,990
issues is just kind of an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

719
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:59,890
open discussion without an attack to

720
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:03,848
happen the big question i have is where

721
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,660
should this go um it's I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I</font>

722
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,130
can productively do

723
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,410
anything with this document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own</font>

724
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:10,690
anymore so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VAD</font>

725
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,058
sponsored or it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into a</font>

726
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,579
working group and if so what working

727
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">group is appropriate for that one</font>

728
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,809
possible future would be to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

729
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,609
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group for it they hopefully very</font>

730
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:23,980
very short-lived working group which

731
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:26,288
we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> before with the lovely work</font>

732
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,549
on on just launched although that wasn't

733
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:31,510
a short-lived as we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

734
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:33,250
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now they never are yes only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

735
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:40,960
grew up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast as your children did um</font>

736
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:42,940
oh you're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind so that's my</font>

737
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,410
question I guess is what do people feel

738
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we need a working group for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this or</font>

739
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:50,649
could this have some dispatch or ad

740
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,059
sponsored<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I mean I don't think it</font>

741
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,829
quite happens in dispatch it could be

742
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:55,660
discussed on that list or whatever but

743
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:56,980
it seems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have two very</font>

744
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,210
different levels of things here that

745
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,010
maybe you should tease apart a little

746
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,960
bit more talk about more because one of

747
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,740
them is a fairly straightforward update

748
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,539
is to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft another way is finding a</font>

749
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,750
way that is a problem lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

750
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:12,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a better registry system and you</font>

751
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,970
clearly have some ideas for that which

752
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,520
are not in this draft yes um I think

753
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:23,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that sounds like a very interesting</font>

754
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:25,690
and meaty topic that is that needs more

755
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,609
more more ability to have a community

756
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,339
input on than we would normally run on

757
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dispatch less sure yeah I I'm not a</font>

758
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:33,609
completely into may have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

759
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that draft but maybe a separate</font>

760
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:38,890
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've tried to have that discussion</font>

761
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:40,118
for at least five years and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

762
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,009
been kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidetracked in other</font>

763
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,990
discussions we had the happy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna work</font>

764
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:46,150
we've had other discussions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

765
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,618
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm very interested in</font>

766
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,539
I'm happy to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with folks but I</font>

767
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,010
need a venue where it's going to be able

768
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be focused upon and we come to a</font>

769
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:57,460
conclusion and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that venue</font>

770
00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:01,180
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I propose one I propose such a venue</font>

771
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:04,240
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is barry i propose</font>

772
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:07,899
that that would be evolved<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it goes</font>

773
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,259
beyond the art area i right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

774
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,779
I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is give the experts</font>

775
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,569
of the registry and full disclosure I am

776
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:18,460
one of the experts of that registry the

777
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to experiment with</font>

778
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,150
how they allow registrations to happen

779
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think trying to write it down</font>

780
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:26,710
in RFC and then execute that is a recipe

781
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,270
for disaster I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

782
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what we need to do for to be clear I</font>

783
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:33,640
wasn't suggesting anything related to

784
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:35,080
this document right there what if so

785
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,730
first of all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this document</font>

786
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,160
should be ad sponsored I don't think we

787
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:42,700
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a working look for it and if we</font>

788
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:46,420
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pursue generalizing some changes</font>

789
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,279
to registry stuff I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

790
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,380
have a ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

791
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,990
some experience with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

792
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,700
well it's interesting you know a lot of

793
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:58,569
the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is not</font>

794
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,970
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that it's something</font>

795
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can happen within the current scope</font>

796
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,279
of work of the experts depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

797
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,710
you look at it yes the reason I was

798
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggesting above is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

799
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,240
good idea we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep it to</font>

800
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,890
ourselves and we want to discuss the

801
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,149
community I just don't offer today and

802
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,680
let's be really clear you have not

803
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,970
presented what this idea is we're

804
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,440
certainly not approving it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

805
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,240
working group right now right right I

806
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,180
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were yes yeah okay</font>

807
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,149
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this document I suggest just</font>

808
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:31,270
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aleksei sponsoring sure I just</font>

809
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't so have you read the iana</font>

810
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:37,210
considerations section of this document

811
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:39,010
okay I mean if we can come to a place

812
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,200
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this document out and</font>

813
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,130
it has enough flexibility net where we

814
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,529
can at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least do some of this</font>

815
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:46,570
experimentation and not have to rewrite

816
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:51,190
it in six months or a year I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

817
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be good I would Wendy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Seltzer w3c</font>

818
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:57,609
and I've brought this to the attention

819
00:47:53,770 --> 00:48:00,040
of w3c community and yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

820
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:05,380
personally I think lightweight registry

821
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:08,800
some useful I can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I'm</font>

822
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:13,690
thinking of but yeah right I'm Roy

823
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:18,910
fielding Adobe um first I i we use links

824
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:22,869
heavily in our upcoming api's so it's

825
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:24,700
that's good public aps so I certainly

826
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope that it moves towards more</font>

827
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,770
standardization the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

828
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,840
to note is that I'm starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on a</font>

829
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:36,280
specification of hypertext references

830
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:42,450
which has a lot of overlap let's talk as

831
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,450
an update to 3986<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we should talk I</font>

832
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:50,680
can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do a seamless transition</font>

833
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,850
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buff this afternoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

834
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't do the registry is</font>

835
00:48:51,850 --> 00:49:00,310
managed it on github so sorry I want to

836
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:02,319
oh how interesting I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage the</font>

837
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,060
registry on github but not form a

838
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:11,680
dependency<font color="#CCCCCC"> on get out which is the fun</font>

839
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:14,410
part I decide Alexa go home I my guess

840
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,940
it's just my sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intuitive sense of</font>

841
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,210
this is that you'd have widespread

842
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,950
interest and not at ITF what a proposal

843
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:24,760
to do that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be brought forward and</font>

844
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:28,390
puffed I don't want to do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

845
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,770
whole ietf yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's way too much</font>

846
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:37,060
pressure on getting it right the first

847
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:42,940
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay returning specifically to this</font>

848
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:48,460
document well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will blame mark no</font>

849
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:50,470

blame that's good other related question

853
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:07,570
is it okay if we use dispatch for

854
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:10,870
soliciting comments on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> document of</font>

855
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:15,250
course your arch well I you know it's

856

you know yet okay fine it's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

857
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:20,680
it is yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be creating</font>

your mailing list if and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

859
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,350
doing working group I mean we could but

860
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:29,910
it's just if it's okay I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use</font>

861
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,910
this pie chart<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

862
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,040
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to read it next and then</font>

865
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,880

866
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,230
dispatchers well either a large I don't

867
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,000
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your permission for this</font>

868
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,130

869
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,390
like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just what I hate</font>

870
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,670
is when it's unclear let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

871
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really clear to people wear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it let's do</font>

872
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">it on dispatch because we brought this</font>

873
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,640
to dispatch and i justjust i think i can

874
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">go always forward to art so that you</font>

875
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,000
choose to sponsor we can say we are now

876
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:10,180
switching this discussion to art<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

877
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you</font>

878
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:28,109
yes no the proposal is for Alexei<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ad</font>

879
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:31,349
sponsor it and he may or may not that's

880
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:31,348
his call

881
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:50,069
ok my name is Colin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gasca from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deutsche</font>

882
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">telekom and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propose an addition to the</font>

883
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:59,100
reason Heather and first I would like to

884
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:02,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that the term location used here</font>

885
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,640
within this<font color="#E5E5E5"> raft has nothing to do with</font>

886
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location use for emergency calling</font>

887
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,700
that I get a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comments back</font>

888
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:18,319
from people to point that out we will

889
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:21,839
see it later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide so with the RFC</font>

890
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,660
3226 where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a reason</font>

891
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">header itself and it allows also to</font>

892
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:30,750
carry q 8 50 courses which are the

893
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:34,230
causes release causes generated within

894
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:38,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes up network and we have also</font>

895
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:40,830
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transport these causes within</font>

896
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:45,209
the reason head up with in responses

897
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:49,200
that's another RFC which we did but what

898
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,840
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft disliking is that we</font>

899
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,970
have a location within the eyes of

900
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,310
network where this call was released and

901
00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:01,859
this is the aim of the draft to at this

902
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,900
location if you go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide it</font>

903
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:07,530
shows at least the nice telephone

904
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:10,590
network the old ones which we have it's

905
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:12,630
not like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP approach and to end we</font>

906
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,610
have some private networks local

907
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:19,070
networks transit networks international

908
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:22,800
networks and this itu-t recommendation

909
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:25,470
have a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> course value which is</font>

910
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,940
called location and this location says

911
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:32,490
for example where this call was released

912
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:35,220
for example we have different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

913
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:39,830
user busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they use itself says i'm</font>

914
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:43,319
busy and user agent or<font color="#CCCCCC"> lisa telephone</font>

915
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:45,029
reject the call and says use a busy or

916
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,090
we have it also within the network

917
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:51,990
itself so that the network says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

918
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:55,650
have no lines to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users so the user</font>

919
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,759
is busy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is where we send the</font>

920
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:02,220
location with

921
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:06,990
the use of busy eyes of course next

922
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:11,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide so why why we do use or why we do</font>

923
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:15,379
need it we have yes mobile networks

924
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:19,650
providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMS which is based on sip and</font>

925
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:23,220
we have still gsm networks PSN networks

926
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:26,190
that are using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sub coding and with</font>

927
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">regard to that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the seamless</font>

928
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:34,040
interoperability between networks and we

929
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:37,859
have seen that we have problems

930
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,920
providing services where we have to

931
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">react on a user pc for example the</font>

932
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:47,850
couple of scenarios and which is

933
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:51,420
important to map a location and that

934
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:54,270
cannot be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with existing sip well</font>

935
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:57,150
you sleep responses which we try to do

936
00:54:54,270 --> 00:55:02,040
we have already examples where we did it

937
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:04,950
with other eyes of course but busy keeps

938
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,259
us busy at least with only two coding so

939
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,629
so we have the pcanywhere and the normal

940
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,360
busy with and sit and that's why we

941
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:16,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">would like to introduce addition to the</font>

942
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:20,040
coding so it's a small ad on within the

943
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:28,250
reason header so and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

944
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:35,130
proposal thank you who's right the strap

945
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:37,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay anybody want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide any</font>

946
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:46,520
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with it</font>

947
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:46,520
suggestions oh sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

948
00:55:49,330 --> 00:56:02,120
right nothing like we are you if I have

949
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:04,160
the mic I guess the one you want

950
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:08,750
comments on the draft or just on whether

951
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:11,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">it hard how to dispatch it I want to</font>

952
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to dispatch it so I've got a</font>

953
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of comments on the dispatch list</font>

954
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,430
already so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will incorporate them at</font>

955
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,620
least mainly it was the use of the

956
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,690
wording location so i will change this

957
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,880
to something like I supplication or

958
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:28,370
something like that so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

959
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,890
if this other could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be anywhere</font>

960
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:35,990
dispatched or if this can be fights amla

961
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:37,279
e d sponsored activity okay I guess I

962
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:44,419
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any comments and where</font>

963
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:47,710
to dispatch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um John Peterson</font>

964
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:50,660
sorry my voice is really going out today

965
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:52,610
yeah so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to occasionally come</font>

966
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,290
up more reason code ish kinds of things

967
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to do so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

968
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:59,750
I can't imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> where being a bucket of</font>

969
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:01,070
like reason cause code I person<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

970
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,510
from stirrer I know there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

971
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people are doing in Addis Mary</font>

972
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,440
maybe you know more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

973
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,330
around some of the reason codes people

974
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,580
want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so I mean you know I</font>

975
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:13,430
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could probably scope an effort</font>

976
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,350
that would be around that but I suspect

977
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:26,060
that would be ill and this could

978
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:27,710
certainly fit into that bucket<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

979
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,210
perspective and I'm speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

980
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,880
support chair for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty some</font>

981
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:35,540
odd hours this seems to fit in zip<font color="#E5E5E5"> cores</font>

982
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,620
new charter just fine so but I think

983
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a reasonable sort of</font>

984
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,880
thing to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked</font>

985
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,740
at the technical content the document i

986
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,900
know he has some thoughts there is going

987
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:50,839
to share in a moment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

988
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:53,710
perfectly good<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you this Pete</font>

989
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,050
Resnick so not being a sick person I

990
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,490
just got whacked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nose rather</font>

last call for the 666 document

993
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:10,250
um and told that headers don't go back

994
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:12,440
through proxies in error codes don't

995
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:15,470
necessarily go back through and that's

996
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">why you had to use 666 and you couldn't</font>

997
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:19,578
put the this is spam<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a header</font>

998
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,549
because it wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it back</font>

1000
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:31,210
this the same thing isn't this the same

1001
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:35,059
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're sticking a header into a</font>

necessarily get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> through proxies</font>

1004
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:46,339
let's say it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new header it's an</font>

1005
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:48,649

1006
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:51,140
queue 850 cause we have the text and

1007
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">then there's some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> additions saying the</font>

1009
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:59,869
headers do always<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it back through</font>

1010
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:07,819
proxies new ones might know is that the

00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> christer homework basically what</font>

1012
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:16,900
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct but at least from</font>

1013
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:21,578
my implementation on and product

1014
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:24,230
experience the reason hitter do go back

1015
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:26,180
in general what the comment that was

1016
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:29,150
made at hitters don't go back yeah I

1017
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:32,089
totally agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that but I would</font>

1018
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:34,339
almost say that de facto standard even

1019
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:36,259
though it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really specified in</font>

1020
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:40,038
anywhere is that the reason how to do

1021
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:42,559
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean II</font>

1022
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:44,150
fighters have either you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know experience</font>

1023
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:53,569
but that's at least you know my

1024
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:55,339
experience so this seems um I mean it

1025
00:59:53,569 --> 00:59:56,990
seemed someone within the scope of sick

1026
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:58,819
or if we decide that we're getting

1027
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:01,339
enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work in sick or that it</font>

1028
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:02,690
makes sense to split off something to

1029
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:03,920
deal with that type of stuff I'm sure

1030
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:08,180
that that could be addressed at that

1031
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,529
point in time I is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak</font>

1032
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,970
about this doing something with other

1033
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:12,970
than sending it to succour<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1034
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:21,640
okay uh I get you know who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1035
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:25,709
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if we send it zip cord just</font>

1036
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:28,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of curiosity okay got one hand</font>

1037
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,979
that's better than zero no we go clearly

1038
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:31,509
we got some days by the room we got a

1039
01:00:29,979 --> 01:00:33,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send this to</font>

1040
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:34,210
sip core obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> support will have to</font>

1041
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,960
decide whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to proceed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1042
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:53,019
it or not that work for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> hip</font>

1043
01:00:36,960 --> 01:01:04,029
dispatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zombie it's like them</font>

1044
01:00:53,019 --> 01:01:06,339
looming there I'm talking very briefly

1045
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a tiny change to D</font>

1046
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:11,109
care how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here know how</font>

1047
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">beacon works most of you okay good so I</font>

1048
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:17,049
have for the rest of you I have a next

1049
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:19,420
slide please next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we go</font>

1050
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:22,119
here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> dekum does it takes it takes</font>

1051
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:24,519
a mail message it hashes it all up it

1052
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,499
signs the hashes with a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key it</font>

1053
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,558
then adds a header to the message with

1054
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:31,180
the sign with the signature then when a

1055
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,619
recipient gets the message they can look

1056
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the corresponding public key in the</font>

01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS verify the signature and if the</font>

1058
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,749
signature is good then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1059
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:46,299
various assertions about assumptions

1060
01:01:40,749 --> 01:01:50,319
about the message next please d<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kim is</font>

1061
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:51,940
defined with it really is a very small

1062
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,680
registry of hash algorithms and

1063
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,569
signature algorithm hash algorithm was a

1064
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:59,019
sha-1 which is deprecated and nobody

1065
01:01:55,569 --> 01:02:01,630
uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore and shot to 256 which we</font>

1066
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:04,029
all use the only signature algorithm

1067
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:08,410
currently is our essay and it's plain

1068
01:02:04,029 --> 01:02:10,359
ordinary RSA and in the signature itself

1069
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:12,399
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tag that says what hash</font>

1070
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:16,420
algorithm and what signing algorithm you

1071
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:22,779
used so it like a equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> make shot to</font>

1072
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:26,109
shot 256 RSA and then in the key the key

1073
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:27,730
does not identify yeah the key says what

1074
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:30,670
signing algorithm is used

1075
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:33,100
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little used optional field about</font>

1076
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:35,320
what hashes you're allowed to use so

1077
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:39,310
both the signature both the signature

1078
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key allow you two are designed</font>

1079
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:45,580
to allow new out on this to be added

1080
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:48,430
next please here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem the spec</font>

1081
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,690
currently says spec is really all the

1082
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:52,330
spec says you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1083
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,690
use five but bit RSA keys but nobody

1084
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">does that anymore i hope the signers</font>

1085
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:00,430
must use at least 1k keys and we are

1086
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:01,359
thinking that 1k keys are ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but</font>

1087
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:04,270
they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little long in the</font>

1088
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,009
tooth so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> expand to too cakey</font>

1089
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:07,359
well that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mean</font>

1090
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:09,010
normally you would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just make</font>

1091
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,960
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer and i'll put the stomach</font>

1092
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:13,570
I'll put the signing key in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and</font>

1093
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:17,590
everything will be cool however it turns

1094
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:20,619
out that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work because a 1k key</font>

1095
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:23,560
is almost 256 bytes we store them in txt

1096
01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:25,780
records txt records are stored in chunks

1097
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:28,119
of when they won with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-bite length</font>

1098
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:30,400
so that each chunk is limited to 256

1099
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:32,170
bytes and although txt records have

1100
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,810
always since the dawn of history been

1101
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:37,030
defined as hen as including more than

1102
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:39,130
one string the crud where that with

1103
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:41,530
which people provision their dns only

1104
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:42,940
handles a single spring and a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1105
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think easier but somebody at</font>

1106
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">google actually went through and and</font>

1107
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,250
tested a bunch of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

1108
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's way too much dns provisioning</font>

1109
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,140
software that only handles a single dns

1110
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,609
string so that in reality the limit of

1111
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:57,160
the txt record is limited to two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1112
01:03:54,609 --> 01:03:58,690
fifty six bytes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

1113
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,850
stupid problem we should not have this

1114
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:02,410
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a moron would write</font>

1115
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,819
software that had this problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1116
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:05,109
world is<font color="#CCCCCC"> full of people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

1117
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:11,109
software like that and then ain't going

1118
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:13,779
to change so i have to promote<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1119
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:16,660
proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions first is new improved</font>

1120
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:18,730
signing algorithm elliptic curve keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1121
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:21,490
tiny code as well debug blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

1122
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:24,550
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all we do is we would we</font>

1123
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,200
would update the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deccan spec to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1124
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:29,770
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of in addition to RSA</font>

1125
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:35,470
signatures you can do you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do ed DSA</font>

1126
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:38,410
signatures and an alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal</font>

1127
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:40,359
which which eric suggested is do what we

1128
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,680
do in other other context and actually

1129
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:43,240
put the signing key in

1130
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,220
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signature so i'll put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1131
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,709
verification key into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signature just</font>

1132
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:50,290
put a hash of the fixed size hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1133
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:52,920
of the verifying verification key into

1134
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:55,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns the hashes of a limited size so</font>

1135
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know so we could do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1136
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:01,059
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a lot this is we then get rid</font>

1137
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:05,740
of the practical limit on the on the on

1138
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:08,140
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> size hmm well if at the cost of</font>

1139
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:11,020
adding a new header field but but sorry

1140
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:13,240
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost adding a new tag to the</font>

1141
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:16,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">D Kim's signature which is also it is</font>

1142
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,459
already defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be to allow more</font>

1143
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,940
tags to be added we could do either or

1144
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">both I think I have one more slide yeah</font>

1145
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,970
so for transition issues we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1146
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,119
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do old and new</font>

1147
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:31,450
signatures the current specs says for

1148
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:35,339
says you can only have a single key

1149
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:39,160
record for each selector which is fruit

1150
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:41,109
and we could relax act and say we could

1151
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,910
have you know two key records one for

1152
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:44,710
the old key and one for the one for the

1153
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:49,089
old signing our algorithm one for the

1154
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:50,589
new signing algorithm during the

1155
01:05:49,089 --> 01:05:52,359
transition verifiers are supposed to

1156
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:55,420
ignore signatures they don't understand

1157
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:57,220
that's I hope that works that is a code

1158
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,359
path that has not been well tested so we

1159
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,919
need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and test it and see how</font>

1160
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">much this is going to break and the</font>

1161
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,099
reason this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is slightly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> urgent is</font>

1162
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,650
there's this thing called arc which is a

1163
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:10,869
mutant version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D Kim that is being</font>

1164
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:13,059
invented to help deal with the the DMark

1165
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:15,309
mailing list issues that i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1166
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:17,400
going to go into here but but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> arc is</font>

1167
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:20,230
the magic bullet arc is based on d<font color="#CCCCCC"> kim</font>

1168
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,630
to the extent that we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> d Kim</font>

1169
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,849
updated now we could get arc updated now

1170
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,260
so that our only so the arc doesn't have

1171
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:30,040
to go through the same transition and

1172
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:32,859
believe that's my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide okay all</font>

1173
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:36,700
right there seemed to be a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

1174
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:42,250
letter it figured back up on some ID

1175
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:43,930
please I think Brett's who are you I'm

1176
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:47,589
sorry Russ<font color="#CCCCCC"> housley I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1177
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:50,950
supporting things like ed 255 19 is a

1178
01:06:47,589 --> 01:06:54,609
good plan however it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

1179
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:55,069
same API as any other signature out it

1180
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:58,400
does

1181
01:06:55,069 --> 01:07:05,150
not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example have a hash algorithm it</font>

1182
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:07,789
is implied by<font color="#E5E5E5"> using ed 2519 how the hash</font>

1183
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,819
will be constructed I know this having

1184
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:14,390
just worked through how to use the CMS

1185
01:07:09,819 --> 01:07:22,400
so your<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is not as plug-and-play as</font>

1186
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:25,459
this presentation implies Phil Han Baker

1187
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:30,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomato I think actually probably want to</font>

1188
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">do both the reason for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is yes going</font>

01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:38,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 250 519 is a good idea right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1190
01:07:34,569 --> 01:07:40,749
but we should try and get ourselves in a

1191
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:45,099
position where we can move on further

1192
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:47,269
you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do ad for a 2-1 point</font>

1193
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:50,140
you might want to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1194
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:52,899
quantum resistant at some point

1195
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:55,489
publishing the key hashes actually

1196
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:57,920
because you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> send as much data</font>

1197
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:59,359
as you like in the mail stream right as

1198
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't irritate the sender</font>

1199
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:08,690
the receiver putting the key hash is the

1200
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:11,690
most flexible thing doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> both their</font>

1201
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:13,729
means that you can add policy type stuff

1202
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:16,960
into what you send and that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1203
01:08:13,729 --> 01:08:19,429
useful for if you want to go to

1204
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,310
anonymous d<font color="#CCCCCC"> kim or some of the other</font>

1205
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:24,529
games<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been playing with amin</font>

1206
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:26,179
it is a highly open question about how

1207
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:28,190
painful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition will be whether</font>

1208
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:30,349
we will end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something like like</font>

1209
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:31,818
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just barely do the transition</font>

1210
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:33,078
will never do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again or else like now</font>

1211
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:34,759
we've debug this we can add new

1212
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:36,380
algorithms you could go either way I

1213
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:37,849
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know well the other thing that you</font>

1214
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:40,190
might want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is maybe if</font>

1215
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:42,920
you did when the key hashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> root then</font>

1216
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:45,649
you could squeeze<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in with the 1024</font>

1217
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:48,578
bit RSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xand have a different transition</font>

1218
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:48,578
time yeah

1219
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:59,799
Duke Crocker um so we have a tendency in

1220
01:08:55,368 --> 01:09:03,948
the ITF to think of doing transitions as

1221
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:06,380
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrated step and we end up</font>

1222
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:10,549
building cruft into the transition

1223
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:12,380
process to do that and the from this the

1224
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:14,630
view that I've developed is the way to

1225
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,759
do a transition is first specify where

1226
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:18,828
you want to be and make it be as clean

1227
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:20,509
as possible and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

1228
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:24,799
separate from any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition</font>

1229
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:28,549
steps and so what got me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get up here</font>

1230
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:31,038
was your statement about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things</font>

1231
01:09:28,549 --> 01:09:34,880
two ways and the message and having two

1232
01:09:31,038 --> 01:09:38,059
different records to support what I

1233
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:42,038
assume was a single selector<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives</font>

1234
01:09:38,059 --> 01:09:44,589
you different keys depending on the type

1235
01:09:42,038 --> 01:09:46,608
it it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy to persuade me to</font>

1236
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:48,710
persuade me that we do with a different

1237
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:50,869
selectors it and that's where I landed

1238
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,908
on is we have a construct for giving

1239
01:09:50,868 --> 01:09:54,769
multiple signatures in a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1240
01:09:52,908 --> 01:09:56,598
multiple signatures it's already there

1241
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:58,070
in fact that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those in the new</font>

1242
01:09:56,599 --> 01:10:00,829
style and one of them is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

1243
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:03,409
style is completely transparent to the

1244
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:05,509
meta structure and it's much simpler<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1245
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:09,019
and and therefore your transition isn't

1246
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:10,969
a transition in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology it's a</font>

1247
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,070
transition in some operational practice

1248
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:15,469
which looks a whole lot like some other

1249
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:19,789
transitions we already support get<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1250
01:10:15,469 --> 01:10:21,650
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> or take the issue that we we hope</font>

1251
01:10:19,789 --> 01:10:23,210
that the existing code will ignore the

1252
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:25,519
signatures that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta doesn't understand</font>

1253
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well but if it doesn't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1254
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,670
have bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with that</font>

1255
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,619
implementation anyhow because we already

1256
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:34,579
have transitions that it has to support

1257
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:38,570
this is just in the macro this is the

1258
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:43,009
same as all of those um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

1259
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:46,639
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russ's comment triggered in</font>

1260
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:49,789
my thinking is it sure would be nice to

1261
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:51,409
move this stuff into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our registry so we</font>

1262
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:54,469
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changing specs</font>

1263
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:56,388
we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did change registry entries and</font>

1264
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:58,460
that requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there be some</font>

1265
01:10:56,389 --> 01:11:00,199
regularization to how the registry entry

1266
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,909
is and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure how to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1267
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,919
it's worth thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I thought we</font>

1268
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:06,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">had registries for that</font>

1269
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,600
yeah well but then we have a whole work

1270
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:10,250
but we have a whole lamps of the whole

1271
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,190
working group that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sort of</font>

1272
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:17,330
kind of doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> except</font>

1273
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:18,678
it is hi I'm Jim pen I may give you a

1274
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:21,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of history but I'll keep it</font>

1275
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:23,900
really short d<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kim is actually a merger</font>

1276
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,360
of two different specifications one of

1277
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,949
which stored the public key and dns and

1278
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,199
the other which stored a hash of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1279
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:32,989
public key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> EMS and we made a</font>

1280
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision when we merge them to put the</font>

1281
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:37,759
public key in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns in order to cut down</font>

1282
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:39,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the message header size because some</font>

1283
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,360
large email provider noted that it would

1284
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:44,660
take some non-trivial number of

1285
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,219
additional disk drives in order to store

1286
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,630
all of those public keys that were

1287
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:54,800
redundant<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee in all of those messages</font>

1288
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:56,810
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we got here um so I mean</font>

1289
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,640
that that's sort of an interesting thing

1290
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:00,560
about design decisions that I wish have

1291
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:04,190
gone the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> region how</font>

1292
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,770
many years ago was that I don't remember

1293
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was probably 12 or so yeah I think</font>

1294
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:14,270
yeah right but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when the</font>

1295
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:18,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision was made in any case um I will</font>

1296
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:21,460
note that publishing the the hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1297
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:24,799
public key and DNS in this particular

1298
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:27,920
application I believe has some IP are

1299
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,300
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be</font>

1300
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:39,350
something else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might want to</font>

1301
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:41,120
consider Eric risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> rola um basically</font>

1302
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:43,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of a phb said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

1303
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,929
what's most flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> its most flexible</font>

1304
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,340
to have the hash the DNS but it's fun we

1305
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:49,370
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing some modern algorithm as</font>

1306
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:50,630
well um I'm seems like we now conversion

1307
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:52,699
Edie's and they were other so I'm

1308
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:56,840
finally that that or also be fine with

1309
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:59,089
PG 56 ecdsa um the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ made</font>

1310
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,400
earlier of course right about the hashes

1311
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:02,989
on my senses the communities actually

1312
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,580
rapidly converging towards the notion

1313
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:08,209
that every curve should we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

1314
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:10,790
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one hash so um I think if</font>

1315
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:12,860
we're actually if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to do um you</font>

1316
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:14,600
know something other than you do find

1317
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,440
her a nine it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know p</font>

1318
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,630
256 reach out to 36

1319
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,549
makes a match like we're doing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh no</font>

1320
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:24,210
it's an RSA thing not really an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

1321
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:25,500
thing I mean the baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> came is specified</font>

1322
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,920
it's easy enough to say you have to use

1323
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:30,060
this hash with this algorithm yeah yeah

1324
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,370
yeah richard barnes plus one<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1i</font>

1325
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,410
current page be said<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what you might</font>

1326
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,849
consider as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love being</font>

1327
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,190
futuristic and using the latest cool

1328
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:40,770
stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I considered you know some</font>

1329
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:42,509
support for what whether it makes sense

1330
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:45,420
the supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> within this curves and it's</font>

1331
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:47,640
like using PG 56 which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256 only</font>

1332
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:50,520
because there are a lot of signers out

1333
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,590
there right now and in you know you

1334
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,960
can't buy a signer right now that does

1335
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:56,280
ed 2551 not as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know people</font>

1336
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,989
probably correct you on that but the

1337
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,519
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support for that in the</font>

1338
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:00,570
market<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is not great so if you</font>

1339
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,640
want to promote deployment you might

1340
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:04,769
consider having some support for

1341
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,000
existing curves in there yeah I mean I'm

1342
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,739
under the impression that this is

1343
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,870
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into openssl real soon</font>

1344
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:12,030
now but I'm certainly open to mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

1345
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:14,130
lazy programmer i would rather use code

1346
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:16,530
exists sure yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm thinking more</font>

1347
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:18,120
about it wasn't so open SSL and software

1348
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,489
leverage an issue but i'm thinking else

1349
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,050
of h SMS which I to the degree that are

1350
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:24,209
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deacon ecosystem I'm not sure</font>

1351
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:29,120
that those will have a longer transition

1352
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">timeline</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is bear Oliva I</font>

1353
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,019
thought this at the beginning of the

1354
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:36,810
queue but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> after hearing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q I'm</font>

1355
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,610
quite certain we seem to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

1356
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:43,830
and it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new working group is</font>

1357
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:48,630
the right answer what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is</font>

1358
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:52,680
no good deed goes unpunished<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a will</font>

1359
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:54,180
remind people that we did in we have

01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">experienced out of here of spinning up</font>

01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:59,310
working groups fast and quickly and

1362
01:14:56,730 --> 01:15:01,139
trying to minimize the amount and pain

1363
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:06,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suffering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that causes the people</font>

1365
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:10,800
thompson the only reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got up was</font>

1366
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:14,310
that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a working group that is</font>

1367
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,739
doing precisely this work um and they're

1368
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:18,810
over in the second area have all the

01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:25,710
that brass and eka and Richard have

1371

talked about the actual interface to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2d</font>

Hakeem is actually pretty trivial

1376
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:39,450
because the design correctly anticipated

1377
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:42,660
the need to change these things they

1378

1408
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:15,720
that's going to commit<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to do nothing</font>

1409
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:19,139
more than just add the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm well I</font>

1410
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:21,210
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can ask yeah so I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1411
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems I had look at that charter head</font>

1412
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,580
time it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me there's two</font>

1413
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:27,690
different issues here<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1414
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:29,519
how to select curves and how to do the

1415
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:31,019
crypto and there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1416
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,700
really about the whole d Kim

1417
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,440
architecture what you're talking about

1418
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,420
an architectural change that has nothing

1419
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do with crypto that's about where you</font>

1420
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,690
store these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pointers to</font>

1421
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,790
them do you want to separate those at

1422
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:43,790
all or um

1423
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,690
they are separate time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are separate</font>

1424
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:54,590
topics but I would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather do one</font>

1425
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:56,509
updated to all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> student are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1426
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going idea this one behind will probably</font>

1427
01:17:56,510 --> 01:18:01,070
disagree with me but and the so I need

1428
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,139
to cut up into this church or would fit

1429
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:05,450
curdle very well I think the changes to

1430
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:08,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> significant signature message header</font>

1431
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:10,370
fields in if you wanted to reach our

1432
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,470
decoder which you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to</font>

1433
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:13,970
include that then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as</font>

1434
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:15,620
long as it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail people actually</font>

1435
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,750
pay some attention but you would need

1436
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:19,309
male people paying attention in fact

1437
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:21,620
that's actually sort of it in an

1438
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:23,870
argument against going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to curdle</font>

1439
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:26,809
since male people tend not to pay much

1440
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:28,340
attention in when in detailed crypto

1441
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:30,920
arguments yeah now all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said this is</font>

1442
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:35,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that hard so yeah anything we</font>

1443
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:39,830
choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work erihskroy yes I rise</font>

1444
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:41,750
to support my former colleague um III<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1445
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:43,940
was originally thinking that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1446
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,620
kernel thing based on Martin's comments

1447
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,849
but I think based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point Colin</font>

1448
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just made I think probably better to</font>

1449
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:50,480
have a small focused working group than

1450
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:53,600
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the pun it to curdle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1451
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">clean I mean I I don't oppose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1452
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Colonel people want to do that but I</font>

1453
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,269
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I were voting as opposed</font>

1454
01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:04,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opposed judging consensus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1455
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:06,530
vote other way so someone Thompson may I

1456
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:10,330
suggest that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area directors for the</font>

1457
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:14,840
to affected areas have that discussion

1458
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:16,850
about who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt it because I'm</font>

1459
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is actually necessarily</font>

1460
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:24,640
an art working group given a propensity

1461
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects with you</font>

1462
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this art ad doesn't object to this</font>

1463
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,330
being in your working group so if if

1464
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:37,010
interested people can write the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

1465
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:40,250
this week then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can sort it out and</font>

1466
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:45,560
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss with Eric about which air</font>

1467
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:48,310
it lands on it Wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll look we'll see</font>

1468
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,900
what we can do for subversion of wheat

1469
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:52,900
yes and yeah

1470
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:57,690
so it's a rite of something really short

1471
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:59,309
and simple doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more a</font>

1472
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:02,789
couple paragraphs put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dispatch</font>

1473
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:04,469
list this week yeah you see I will get

1474
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:07,440
our area directors decide what to do

1475
01:20:04,469 --> 01:20:09,179
with it next there's you know yes and

1476
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:13,079
census on the list it'll be done yeah

1477
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:16,320
and also please come talk to me about

1478
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:21,090
possible if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a chair</font>

1479
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:33,900
I assume it's not going to be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1480
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:35,610
other document it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so uh for the</font>

1481
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,799
minutes i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal here is to</font>

1482
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:40,469
move forward with this as a proposed

1483
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">midi working group with a quick charter</font>

1484
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:44,460
and we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get consensus on</font>

1485
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:47,570
the heart but everyone's good with that

1486
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,570
as a losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1487
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:19,630
yes I didn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very clearly and I</font>

1488
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:22,150
apologize so this patch has not fully

1489
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:24,250
dispatched this yet but our proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1490
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:25,929
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they write that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going the</font>

1491
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:28,120
direction we're going on dispatching it

1492
01:21:25,929 --> 01:21:29,860
is with a mini working group right a

1493
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,660
charter for the mini working group if we

1494
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:33,639
can get consensus on that many working

1495
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,010
group along with the area directors

1496
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,960
obviously then it will be dispatched

1497
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:47,110
into that that seems highly likely that

1498
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:48,699
could happen quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's um this is</font>

1499
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:50,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of our stuff so unless we're</font>

1500
01:21:48,699 --> 01:22:07,089
going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to streaming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Blues on</font>
