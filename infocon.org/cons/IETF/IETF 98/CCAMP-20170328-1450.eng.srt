because we decided not to do a specific

45
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,900
encoding for that document of what we

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,430
decided that we have it in a more

47
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,739
generalized way we submitted the

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,350

55
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:54,230
in inches working group / drafts we have

56
00:04:51,110 --> 00:05:00,170
three documents are being discussed the

57
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:03,010
day and a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documents that they</font>

58
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:09,610
will not be disgusted we received the

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,130
matter of doing the right after we

64

67
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,250
around for awhile

68

a tease they generalize the SCSI

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:10,130
extensions yeah rsvp-te bandwidth

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:15,020
availability is a companion document of

78
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:18,350
the u.s. pfg extensions it's basically

79
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:23,479
stable and is ready to move to move on

80
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:26,870
after the USB ft is ready and then we

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,360
have the dub usana impedimenta wearing

82
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,640
for model it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the reason recently</font>

refreshed but we didn't get them and

84
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,219
much discussion on the on the mini vista

85
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,990
recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if any of the</font>

86
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,890
authors who would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the</font>

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:46,340
shot up data maybe you know who was the

<font color="#CCCCCC">upgrade to the document and they think</font>

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,650
all this done so we should ask for a let

94
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:12,340
us code I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you</font>

95
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,340

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework document for control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

100
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,890
management of signal channel optical

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,860
interfaces I think motivation is quite

102
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:55,330
clear we presented this document many

103
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,560
times here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea camp so first of all</font>

104
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,530
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to achieve is</font>

105
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,950
interoperability and for that kind of

106
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:07,010
things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to exchange and define a</font>

107
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:11,360
common set of parameters that we can use

108
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:15,950
in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second topic that</font>

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,930
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address here is the better</font>

110
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,440
interworking between the layers so that

111
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:25,970
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical and the transport</font>

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:30,320
layer yeah could be work more efficient

113
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:32,870
in a more efficient manner than today so

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,429
that we addressed here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document</font>

115
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:42,130
and the scope i present it many times as

116
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">well as on requirements and use cases we</font>

117
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:49,880
described a lot of things here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in lot of</font>

118
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">use cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this document should be as</font>

119
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,570
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guidance draft for two other</font>

120
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,910
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are mentioned here on</font>

121
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:08,920
this lights that we are presenting later

122
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:12,770
on so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look on this new version 04</font>

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,459
then we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following things so we</font>

124
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:19,990
update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DD requirements section</font>

125
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:23,090
addressed the comments of the chairs and

126
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,820
yet did a lot of rephrasing and error

127
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,920
correction and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I deleted some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text as</font>

128
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,410
well that is not really necessary and

129
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,949
helpful yeah that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did and yeah</font>

130
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,920
we think the document is quite stable

131
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:47,000
and we can go for working group last

132
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:54,319

present there are young data model for

148
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:14,959
wsn networks I think the major change is

149
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:18,709
basically we updated link attribute and

150
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:23,480
edit operational state of link attribute

151
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:27,260
I think I got a comment from deeper what

152
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,140
is default frequency mean here actually

153
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:33,410
I meant anchor frequency 193<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 dot</font>

154
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,500
terahertz which is the position of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

155
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,600
free you know central frequency when<font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font>

156
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">equal 0 so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change that to</font>

157
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,120
anchor frequency which is i.t i.t term

158
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,359
yeah and then we kind of clean up a node

159
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:58,040
attribute pointing to the right

160
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:00,650
augmentation because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of this</font>

161
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,040
is this is augmentation model from the

162
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:07,430
apology<font color="#E5E5E5"> model and then they kind of my</font>

163
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:11,990
great themselves to augment from general

164
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:16,400
topology model so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we up to</font>

165
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:22,250
date may come up to dated augmentation

166
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:25,490
reference and then again added

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:32,300
operational state for loaded sugar

168
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:38,630
container and then once we publish this

169
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:43,160
we passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PM check but later we were</font>

170
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,280
informed by young doctors that something

171
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,800
failed and then we noticed that

172
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,819
connectivity made tricks from topology

173
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,800
model they change name to connectivity

174
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:59,840
matrices and then they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> connectivity</font>

175
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">matrix so i was told that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

176
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,920
change to make sure that this has p.m.

177
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,800
test so that's something that we are

178
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do in the next update hopefully</font>

179
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,810
a topology will be stabilized and then I

180
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:18,800
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to have</font>

181
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:23,300
this kind of problem yeah I think I'm

182
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:28,939
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my last slide for w some young</font>

183
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:34,010
model do you have any question I have

184
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:37,430
one which is video I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font>

185
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,769
follow the latest discussion on the

186
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,670
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day I forest</font>

ecology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the de quito politic the</font>

188
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,939
fact that the thing sir could change now

189
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,430
good the exchange in the relationship

190
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:57,350
between the two models<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the impact sir</font>

191
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:59,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document or not i don't think so</font>

192
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think we argument sold it from</font>

193
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,709
topology model heat apology model we

194
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,110
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if i remember correctly from</font>

195
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:11,959
metal model so probably dependence may

196
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,800
not be there but i cannot i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

197
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,599
it up yeah truth from coming basically

198
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,459
the augment path changes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> kate</font>

199
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,320
apology so we may have to just change

200
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:30,969
the topic van path<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the rest of the</font>

201
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:33,290
model okay okay um this is a flexgrid

202
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,720
young model I don't think how we have a

203
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:41,270
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much we work on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

204
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:45,020
while but the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> also George chitters</font>

205
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:49,550
in comparative is a research guy so he

206
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:57,290
asked me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present a flexgrid optical</font>

207
00:14:49,550 --> 00:15:00,760
network model yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

208
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,760
motivation is basically we have

209
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologies specific model this one</font>

210
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,269
addresses flux great we have generic

211
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,579
model I tourettes model and city and

212
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:16,519
Douglas and young model and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

213
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:21,500
basically provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> LexA grade based on 76</font>

214
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,660
98 and it extends from existing generic

215
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,510
young model what that means is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

216
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:33,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">theater policy model there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are two self</font>

217
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:37,069
models within the draft one is about a

218
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:40,310
flexgrid topology model and the other

219
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:43,870
needs a media channel model the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

220
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:48,050
made a decision to separate into two

221
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,660
young draft on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next revision because</font>

222
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,150
one is a topology obstruction the other

223
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,339
one is tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> model so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to</font>

224
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,620
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into one draft so it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

225
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">be two separate model into two separate</font>

226
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:06,620
draft and both models are implemented in

227
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:10,640
young one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one and and actually this</font>

228
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:13,100
will surpass the pr verification but

229
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,920
because of connectivity made tricks a

230
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,930
change in the topology model it fails

231
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,660
again so we have to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the the</font>

232
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:27,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">later revision through there are you</font>

233
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a few things here future work we</font>

234
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to separate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a media channel</font>

235
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,040
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> augmentation of the eternal model</font>

236
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,820
in the next revision is a separate draft

237
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,469
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think one of the comments from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d2</font>

238
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,590
I believe he want to use application

239
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,140
code instead of specific modulation type

240
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,660
correct yeah so that is actually

241
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">consistent with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CTN working group in</font>

242
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,640
gentle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's time to sew this going to be</font>

243
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:01,250
fixed in the later revision weerakoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

244
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one more you</font>

245
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,640
know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to define single</font>

246
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,730
operational model actually bit for

247
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">occupational transponders instead of you</font>

248
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,470
know making complete list here we're

249
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:17,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take similar to open config</font>

250
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:21,589
approach and as I said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

251
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,420
split into two draft and although this

252
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,579
is first time we present this is already

253
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">version 5 and I know some of you have</font>

254
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,340
read and I would ask for working group

255
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,160
adoption because this is important

256
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,090
extension because of importance of flux

257
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,690
great work

258
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:43,139
[Music]

259
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,390
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> dita brother nokia I have a</font>

260
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for clarification the draft</font>

261
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,390
defines a transponder and I think a sly

262
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,330
ssible transponder for me it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

263
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,130
what right at em so what specifically

264
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,480
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sly ssible transponder is I</font>

265
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's some proprietary terms</font>

266
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,240
you're going to take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out okay yeah</font>

267
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,580
it's not I to Utley defined start

268
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,100
writing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> a European Union this is</font>

269
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,530
actually outcome of you European Union

270
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,870
research and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explore that</font>

271
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:20,190
with that particular vendor I believe

272
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:26,010
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a proprietary stuff yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

273
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:28,590
script I read the draft and very

274
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,290
interesting but there's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

275
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,290
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should clarify a random</font>

276
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:37,139
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flag spirit is</font>

277
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,230
typically what you use for coherent

transmission media<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean transformer</font>

279
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,590
however there are no application codes

280
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,570
for Korean transponders so how do we

281
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,290
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve the discrepancy between</font>

282
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,710
what is the purpose of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and how</font>

283
00:18:52,290 --> 00:19:01,040
to reference it yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are going</font>

284
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide application code for which</font>

itt has defined within that combines

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:13,950
anything beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we want to</font>

287
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:21,030
go that path that's my comment they are

adjustment of this model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

292
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:35,610
cooking so have you considered to do the

293
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,420
same so for example do want to align

294
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,949
your model with the open configure w

295
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,590
model that has not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> determined</font>

296
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,890
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody has looked at it how to</font>

297
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,459
use a Tattler model are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you recommend</font>

298
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,610
use open config

299
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:54,550
eternal model<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recommend to adjust so</font>

300
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:58,600
that suggests<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see in</font>

301
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:02,080
the definitions and basically maybe

302
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,620
incorporate them are who yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

303
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,649
suggest to<font color="#CCCCCC"> augmented but right what</font>

304
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,479
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> te</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Taylor model also themselves</font>

305
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,900
with innovative what is their position

306
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,690
on your where we actually spent like

307
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,480
last probably two or three medians

308
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:22,360
adjusting the model with open config

309
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,810
right model then we are going to augment

310
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,510
your teeth Alamo doctorate is 41 yeah

311
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:31,300
but but it's it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> double diem</font>

312
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,150
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a base yes I understand</font>

313
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,580
it's a basic but you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

314
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,440
WDM part of open config yeah yeah i

315
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,840
think you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to consult</font>

316
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sure so I suggest Lulu</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

317
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,050
coming back to the argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I</font>

318
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:53,170
think it was basically responding with

319
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">litter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to divergent things so the</font>

00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:00,610

323
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:11,380
or her gigahertz so this one is

324
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,480
future-looking it goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flexgrid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

325
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,280
you're saying okay we are using the

326
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,440
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> codes from here in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

327
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:23,470
do that so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean no that's</font>

328
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not my point um you know application</font>

329
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,930
code is specific the product of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Tiote</font>

330
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,810
yeah so we said we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add</font>

331
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:35,470
application code that means we are

332
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,570
limited to whatever is defined which is

333
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,720
50 gigahertz another gigahertz but not

334
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,360
flex rate yeah some probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

335
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,650
application code the right places<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS on</font>

336
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,649
young model and here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font>

337
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,960
can be done because we share the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

338
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:55,780
draft but this is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

339
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,580
can answer this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

340
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,340
technical thing that I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer i</font>

341
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,250
think maybe Deborah is here and so a

342
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,740
little bit more higher level or what

343
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,260
Group cheers kind of you know steroids

344
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,420
as to how to do this because yeah I'm

345
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">not asking you're right it's right for</font>

347
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:17,669
model guy that's it you know you're

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:25,050
young lee i know you're young model

349
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:27,840
ahead getting melty following<font color="#CCCCCC"> igora</font>

350
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,180
comments if we consider dropping a few

351
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,909
we have also to computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> add consider</font>

352
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:37,800
also other kind of model strike<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rodin and whatever then it's a unlimited</font>

355
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,120
understood the problem cancel when the

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,440
problem that is my question for eager

359
00:22:50,190 --> 00:23:01,940
was why open topic and not other models

360
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:04,500
but dieter again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually commented or</font>

361
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,020
send a comment to the sea camp mailing

362
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">list on this draft where I was proposing</font>

363
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,540
that we should follow the same approach

364
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,620
that open config is using in their young

365
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:20,100
models instead of defining a long list

366
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,550
of transponder characteristics I think

367
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,500
they defined an operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode and</font>

368
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,510
this allows and I think we have to

369
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that currently there is no</font>

370
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:34,530
interoperability possible for coherent

371
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,800
transponders of hundred egg and beyond

372
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,710
because of the missing data plane

373
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,800
standards and as long as that's not the

374
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,900
case we could just follow the approach

375
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,350
that open country was using to define

376
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:53,310
for each vendor operational modes which

377
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,199
would allow to create a path and if

378
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,820
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an operational mode on the</font>

379
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,680
source and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination that is in</font>

380
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">common and there's a good chance that</font>

381
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:05,520
the path is feasible without knowing

382
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,470
whether the optical feasibility is given

383
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,710
or not I mean at least there is some

384
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,179
indication whether the path could be

385
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">established between two it to</font>

386
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,830
transponders from the same vendors

387
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,000
my comment was that basically it is

388
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,500
would be very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look into what</font>

389
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,790
other people are doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this layer</font>

390
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so open config 'it's it's one thing</font>

391
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,950
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal preference it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

392
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,350
better way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that open the rhythm</font>

393
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,630
but nothing precludes also to look into

394
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:42,840
open the rhythm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also take whatever I</font>

395
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I you find it useful I see mindset to</font>

396
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,730
put it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so basically it is</font>

397
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,159
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you know you know</font>

398
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll ignore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone and we have like</font>

399
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:57,090
all the expertise we need to define us

400
00:24:52,260 --> 00:25:09,060
our semantics but it wouldn't be too

401
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:11,040
clever I think Deborah venis ad this is

402
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we have that often</font>

403
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,710
we're doing work that I to hasn't

404
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually standardized its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mother's and</font>

405
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:23,550
of course we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to wait for the</font>

406
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:25,530
long window of time so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can continue</font>

407
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to progress the document and the chairs</font>

408
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:30,270
could have answered this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

409
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,250
we've done this many times over and who

410
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,850
should blaze on with I to to find out

411
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,280
the latest status and if it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

412
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,179
early that they're not ready yet we can

413
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,010
always do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's experimental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or if it</font>

414
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,380
seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> only some interest by one</font>

415
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,850
vendor or two they can do it independent

416
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,470
stream but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think agency can't be like</font>

417
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,830
to review it and then we would just do

418
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:58,410
it as experimental so the chairs know

419
00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:00,360
are very well able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle this we we</font>

420
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,190
always said that we would prefer the

421
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,800
experimental tracker other than a day

422
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:07,950
individual string but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it station abuse</font>

424
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">right because I think all of us are</font>

425
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,530
interested here in it so it can keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

426
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,530
experimental it stays here

427
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,010
a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one file on comment to the OC</font>

428
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:28,709
I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double-check</font>

429
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:32,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you frustrated TT and young models</font>

430
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:36,990
you to augment te topology all covers an

431

432
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,010
fresh grade has much closer relationship

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,960
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff some rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than our generic</font>

434
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,350
collagen right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

435
00:26:45,960 --> 00:27:00,539
we can treat the sixth grade at kind of

436
00:26:49,350 --> 00:27:04,139
special case of that's great yeah hello

437
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:07,710
everyone and i'm naming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> poway so</font>

438
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:11,939
for the next to a presentation ever give

439
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:15,289
update to just place a framework for

440
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:18,899
management and control of microwave and

441
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:22,049
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> millimeter wave interface</font>

442
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:26,279
parameters so here's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> author list of</font>

443
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:29,360
anomalous filled actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

444
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">March update on this framework draft and</font>

445
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:37,049
the draft has just been adopted by the

446
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,110
working group in last December so

447
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:44,190
currently there's no open topics for

448
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:48,418
this frame drop and so our design team

449
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:51,389
short set up ah the framework dropped is

450
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:56,549
already done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we would like to uh</font>

451
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:58,979
are mmm thinking about we could move it

452
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:01,950
towards the last hope and another

453
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,860
quantity that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will further</font>

454
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,250
tvoei I developed the young models and

455
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,340
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on what hits defined in</font>

456
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,039
this framework drought and we didn't

457
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,789
receive any further back stance adoption

458
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:21,330
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current status under the</font>

459
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:24,269
next step for the framework draft and if

460
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,970
no further comments and we moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

461
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:33,059
next one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our are young draft</font>

462
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:38,190
and so this young dropped

463
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:41,700
first of all an overview just a several

464
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,309
hour key points the first one is that we

465
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,909
follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> framework which is just</font>

466
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:49,590
mentioning in the first presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

467
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:55,019
another point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it will argument</font>

468
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:58,139
based on RC 1772 industry and as you

469
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:03,240
could see<font color="#CCCCCC"> gran self figure on the top</font>

470
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:05,428
right yes L we were our argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arps</font>

471
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,840
easily turn into to serve you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

472
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:13,980
also live space for implementation of

473
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,249
vendor specific to further argument on

474
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:21,749
that so you have to frame out the

475
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:25,470
freedom to add what you want another

476
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:29,119
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when we're developing this</font>

477
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:32,730
young model we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a two important</font>

478
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,649
inputs we're in the fronds are draft to

479
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,440
our bug as they can microwave brick

480
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:40,379
building and that's when it's the only f

481
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,769
microwave model so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

482
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:48,240
discussed on on these two models in the

483
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:53,100
later side and on the arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> baaton baaton</font>

484
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">are right yes you could say that what</font>

485
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:01,529
with the funds interface hierarchy and

486
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite simple for the</font>

487
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:08,600
internet and the TDM that's the typical

488
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,490
or supplant service of the microwave<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

489
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,428
the revealing terminal and is a carrier

490
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,999
termination as what we defined in this

491
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:22,230
drought it's just two layers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

492
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:25,110
microwave functions and another point is

493
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,539
that here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example you don't</font>

494
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,508
have have to be to carriage and

495
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,220
measuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> Easton at Winston's and you</font>

496
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:38,759
could you just have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one al khair</font>

497
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:43,860
recommendation so update fronts are 0 0

498
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:46,830
and we have a new coercer from NEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> koji</font>

499
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,260
and we have competitors of

500
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,689
microwave Yankees a model because in the

501
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,940
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> region we just defined as a young</font>

502
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:57,029
model photo gallery termination

503
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,840
configuration and in this model in this

504
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:03,690
version we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have completed also our mr.</font>

505
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">olympia part which includes the TDM</font>

506
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:10,529
connection our chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fagan state and</font>

507
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:14,779
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> city states and also some</font>

508
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:18,990
protection are expensive and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mo and</font>

509
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:24,210
this young model has successfully passed

510
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:28,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDM validation and so the right part</font>

511
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:31,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a arm some examples fronts are</font>

512
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,820
young model which is this just shows are

513
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,000
carried him nation and status and

514
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:42,928
another con is that in the latest

515
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">variety of general and we have article</font>

516
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:51,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give our progress and what's been</font>

517
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:57,389
going on on this work it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font>

518
00:31:51,750 --> 00:32:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you check about this web link mistress</font>

519
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:03,570
is just to give a brief example<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

520
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,880
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model because we think is</font>

521
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,970
this is quite useful when we are

522
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:13,169
developing the model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> harris shows</font>

523
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:17,610
are very the simple for example the left

524
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:21,210
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sorry left who is just showing</font>

525
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:24,570
from the microwave note of<font color="#CCCCCC"> view and you</font>

526
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">could say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rage functions and</font>

527
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:30,600
then connected to the radio link

528
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">activation and then further to camera</font>

529
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,320
termination and under all right part

530
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,600
right side you will see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will be</font>

531
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,250
showing our front the interface and the

532
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,610
interface days so that's uh that's the

533
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,090
are below the slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows up our</font>

534
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:54,389
attributes value for each relative

535
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:57,418
attributes for example the ethernet

536
00:32:54,389 --> 00:33:00,469
interface the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> read relevance to</font>

537
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:05,450
this is the lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> larry interface with</font>

538
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:08,450

539
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">arch in our lair you will see confit</font>

540
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:15,890
with its Elaine and it's a mold and also

541
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:19,210
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrow key Winkler ways the</font>

542
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">camera termination and as a carrot</font>

543
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:26,179
carrot emulation there then you will see

544
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:31,940
the the types of file<font color="#CCCCCC"> names</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font>

545
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:35,690
karaoke and this night we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

546
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a some clarification and our what</font>

547
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,669
we define here and what's the difference

548
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,549
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oneg model because we</font>

549
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:45,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">receive some comments on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so we</font>

550
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:49,220
failed may be necessary to have this

551
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,520
clarification so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um one point one point</font>

552
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,130
is that what is defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> in on air base</font>

553
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,340
our information model and while what we

554
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:02,260
have to find here it's a data model and

555
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:08,259
we have a get some reference from

556
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:14,239
existing RC search as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FC 3444 and</font>

557
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:17,480
RCS or 2 198 so basically the key point

558
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,388
is that poster information model and a

559
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,399
data model it's just to define the

560
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:25,810
management objects purpose for different

561
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,500
purpose usually the information model is

562
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:32,929
defined in our conceptual level and

563
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:37,159
while there are data mano SI have a more

564
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:39,639
literal detailed and another point is

565
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:43,970
that's helped with so many

566
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:48,169
implementation details so another point

567
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:52,580
fact we found from our sister 21 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 98</font>

568
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:55,759
is that there's statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a data</font>

569
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:58,609
model it basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real rendering</font>

570
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,010
of an information model I think this too

571
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:04,069
artsy explained very well what's the

572
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:07,099
relationship between the data model and

573
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:10,640
the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode and another fact is</font>

574
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:13,880
that when we're developing this young

575
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,879
data modeling IDF we take the reference

576
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:23,570
bran COF information model as a very

577
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:26,240
important input so this transmitters

578
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,850
among open discussion we received

579
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,950
recently received a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good comments</font>

580
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:37,310
from locating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its include someone</font>

581
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:40,910
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ism to be clarified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and some</font>

582
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:43,250
to be updated so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will continue to</font>

583
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,779
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with looking at and</font>

584
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:52,760
also we will try to have the discussion

585
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:55,340
among the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk among the list and the</font>

586
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,350
further step is that we would like to

587
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">add some technology-specific alarms in</font>

588
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:08,509
rem<font color="#E5E5E5"> data model and then there's some</font>

589
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,600
questions we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

590
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:17,000
working group such as whether it's

591
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:20,060
valuable to include the examples just of

592
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,370
being shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous slides to be</font>

593
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,880
including heart of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

594
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:28,880
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> into our appt endings or annex</font>

595
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,890
which is worse well because i personally

596
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,010
think it's a very worthwhile because

597
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:38,420
that will help to clarify how to use the

598
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:42,760
model and another point is that should

599
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:46,250
we add the capability into the model

600
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:50,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a question regarding to for</font>

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:54,050
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the model defined function</font>

so sure the network elements to report

that my crib lady is already to a B and

which is not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to config c or</font>

616
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just some generic apart</font>

617
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,870
especially for this protection so we'll

618
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:51,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a wonder to know if there is a</font>

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:55,880
further interest to put this protection

620
00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:02,360
into a even more general dropped so

621
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:04,550
that's the open discussion and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">step we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve the</font>

better<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for our working group</font>

628
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,680
adoption and I must punish that we will

629
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a site discussion this rake and</font>

anyone who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested the pace</font>

631

welcome to join our discussion thank you

632
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:50,180

to the list

635
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:04,900
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually one we adopted that there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a framework document we receive a</font>

637
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:11,680
really see the lot of requests to

638
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:16,510
consider the world have been done even

639
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:22,210
after and the design team did a great

640
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:24,760
job particularly taking into account of

641
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:27,120
what is being done in not internet and

642
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,490
the providing us with the clarification

643
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,589
between the information model the data

model what is done here what is done

645
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:41,640
there but this is really pretty good

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:47,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">number thank you and I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

647
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:52,270
try to sense the temperature see if the

648
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,940
working group is interested in using

649
00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:00,100
this document as the starting point for

650
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:04,140
a for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group work so first of</font>

everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is interested in microwave</font>

653
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:20,560
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who is in favor to adopt</font>

654
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:25,410
the draft as a working group document

655
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,410
and use it as the basis for our work

656
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyone against great no one perfect</font>

there are some gaps in the current

735
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:08,160
so far and we have analyzed how do you

have still many open issues to address

wanted to like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftp and we and that</font>

777
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,328
that would be a segment of an end-to-end

778
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,130
tunnel so we have analyzed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indy case</font>

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attributes I need to be set up</font>

00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,349
these lights I will go very quickly is

describing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the elements that needs</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got them and we have a law</font>

784
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,379
allowing a set of open issues that we

need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss some have been already</font>

786
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,289
addressed but this one are still pending

787
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:18,599
so when we look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> euro element Omar</font>

788
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:20,490
Sandahl af- 1-1<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have some in</font>

789
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tunnel mode that the euro is saying</font>

who that IDK phys ed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tito polish</font>

791
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,430
we don't have rooted at the interface ad

792
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,440
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get this information we</font>

793
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,750
have an assumption the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rueter ID isn't</font>

794
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,579
he know that the energy phys ed is a TTP

795
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,309
ID but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to die validate that with</font>

796
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,109
the authors of the two drafts we have

797
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:39,299
some discussion about how do we

798
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:41,759
configure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ole you two time slots on</font>

799
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:43,470
the assess link so whether it is

800
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">selected by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NDS see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether there is</font>

801
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:49,980
some negotiation there is some suggested

802
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:52,980
label coming up from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the PNC</font>

803
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:57,630
and this is still a discussion on going

804
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:59,640
girl then that's the also the

805
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,839
possibility to have some suggested label

806
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,788
and negotiation depends on the

807
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">restaurant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operations when you create a</font>

809
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:09,779
tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is the tunnel already set up</font>

810
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,759
or is just your request is accepted and

811
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:14,880
then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the tunnel has</font>

812
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,950
been set up or not we have also some

813
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,990
discussion to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done about the other</font>

814
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,180
draft on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport control not young</font>

815
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,009
whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is applicable to all various</font>

816
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,558
cases or not depends also on

817
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,270
applicability on cmin<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpi we need to</font>

818
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,150
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the authors of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

819
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:32,819
as you have seen when we start

820
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,680
documenting the how the model is used we

821
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,900
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power point which is easy to</font>

822
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,569
write them but is much more difficult to

823
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">put in a little draft</font>

824
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:43,250
doing in text but text is complex to

825
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,590
write the order England so we would like

826
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see some tools well passer and this</font>

827
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:50,840
ongoing discussion on how to do that and

828
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,910
then we have a some issue about the

829
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,460
scope that we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question whether we</font>

830
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:58,399
have to analyze in terms of analysis so

831
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,290
otherwise do llamadas our current

832
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,630
assumptions that the use cases that we

833
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,730
work through our should be the super set

834
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,340
up for the use cases from all day as the

835
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:10,130
AUSA but the analysis should be focused

836
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,460
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF in our model since we are in</font>

837
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDF and of course with our document is</font>

838
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,630
open so we appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> your father's do</font>

839
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:21,050
can take our use cases and analyze their

840
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:22,730
Andhra llamo does how they support they

841
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:26,300
use the superset of the use cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

842
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,100
we have and then what document analysis

843
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,800
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea now is to have a different</font>

844
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph for analysis and to split the use</font>

845
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,550
case which is independent from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

846
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:37,460
from the analysis that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is saying how the</font>

847
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,870
model is addressing the use cases and we

848
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,480
ever got a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the tech not</font>

849
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just specific commendation and we we</font>

we discuss yes there will there is a

861
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:24,500
cocky attitude to portland /<font color="#E5E5E5"> oceania we</font>

862
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,330
will discuss that<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah okay yeah yeah</font>

863
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,620
data plane architecture we assume the

864
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">iqt data plane architectural reads yeah</font>

865
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:37,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i ever goes on that's an</font>

866
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,670
email on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor about the usage of of</font>

867
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:43,100
layering some maybe you can just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

868
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:48,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the road and over</font>

869
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:50,270
there that one yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

870
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,520
something let's say lose some loose

871
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:55,030
wording

872
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,700
at least on the email but<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer so for</font>

873
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:01,840
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at this where is the</font>

874
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">transponder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next picture seems to</font>

875
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,150
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's responder is in that the</font>

876
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:09,400
rectangle boxes in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the</font>

877
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous picture assumption here is that</font>

878
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,690
the oldies i wrote you cross connect

879
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:16,420
electrical cross-connect oscillation

880
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:19,240
traffic at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your new layer and this is</font>

881
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency ideal new layer and we don't</font>

882
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,560
see in our use case in this case which

883
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,020
is single<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer yeah we don't want to</font>

884
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:29,320
control the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Year Zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is below the</font>

885
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:32,380
later on which is fair again if you go

886
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,790
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the previous one so there's</font>

887
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,150
there's a kind of a mixture of saying

888
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:39,040
okay what what do you redefine in your

889
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:42,040
use case has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a layer is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind</font>

890
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,870
of what previously has been settin

891
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:49,690
loosely said to be a control layer so

892
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:52,509
you have a vm pls say TDM or ODU is this

893
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:56,530
your layer you're really caring<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

894
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:58,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">we already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go let's say on itu layers</font>

895
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:01,420
and have a controller for each

896
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:03,129
individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer though this</font>

897
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,590
there's absolutely no clarity about what

898
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:08,410
what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're early</font>

899
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:10,660
addressing it in this case we say there

900
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:13,690
is a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer of you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

901
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">which audio switching no multiplexing</font>

902
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:18,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that's perfect but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

903
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:19,810
there are several odu's each of the

904
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:22,870
audios is a different layer so are you

905
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:24,310
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay yeah I see what you mean</font>

906
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,620
you want to say whether we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

907
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:28,570
topology think the assumptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

908
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:32,980
single topology I we we can discuss

909
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:34,930
that's that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah okay I see</font>

910
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:40,720
you need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terminology there</font>

911
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:44,259
right okay that young miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi Lou</font>

912
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,459
burger you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPI as</font>

913
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,500
the reference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is that correct</font>

914
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,700
yes this one yeah okay so where you're

915
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,200
getting your requirements because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

916
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,299
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about that there's a</font>

917
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,189
mismatch in some models versus the

918
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,550
requirements so where you're getting

919
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,830
your requirements he said that you

920
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,750
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said no tidy for something</font>

921
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:04,090
else oh yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this about you</font>

922
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,230
when you want to set up the tunnel here

923
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">mhm you</font>

924
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,450
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify this point and if you</font>

925
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at a year or were you driving</font>

926
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:19,049
driving your requirements you i running

927
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:22,030
from other we said it looked at other

928
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:24,310
yes yeah look at all the use cases and

929
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:27,760
we say well we have a use case where we

930
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:30,220
have an audio network which is providing

931
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,160
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> OT you started we have an end-to-end</font>

932
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:36,640
owed you from<font color="#CCCCCC"> puter 12 Rooter tree which</font>

933
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,618
has to cross 98 neural network am so so

934
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end to end audio is clearly seen by</font>

935
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:44,590
the MDS see because the MDS see controls

936
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,450
everything but on this interface what

937
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,490
you need to ask is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in audio segments</font>

938
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:49,990
that is entering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the networker from this</font>

939
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and leaving the network from this</font>

940
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,100
point so there's different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

941
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,400
this and then the work that's going on

942
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:00,029
in actn verley NTS hasn't quite gotten

943
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:06,700
to the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of detail that you are</font>

944
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:10,780
right mm-hmm and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll get there to</font>

945
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,430
say so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how you</font>

946
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,590
went from your require your stated

947
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,649
requirements to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worrying about something</font>

948
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:19,900
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> low level without that</font>

949
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:21,580
larger work have been having<font color="#E5E5E5"> been done</font>

950
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,630
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess we can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a couple</font>

951
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,810
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all there's a</font>

952
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:29,109
requirements document<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright for actn</font>

953
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:31,299
did you look at that not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> derive the</font>

954
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,410
use cases about the department so

955
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,210
there's a requirements document for the

956
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,950
transport MPL be really interesting to

957
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,270
see if your use cases are identifying

958
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,980
any requirements that are not satisfied

959
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,660
in that document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really</font>

960
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice house</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at the</font>

961
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:46,089
euskerri requirements or face again to

962
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,910
see if there are missing requirements in

963
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:51,250
the actn that<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case</font>

964
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:53,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay so you know that this</font>

965
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:55,330
work are expected to talk about use

966
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,310
cases yum the presentation is getting

967
00:53:55,330 --> 00:54:00,430
into solutions no no we have as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

968
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:02,350
we have to work use case is describing a

969
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:05,140
use case and analysis is describing the

970
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:09,040
solution for for the use case and this

971
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,750
one is the use case and and then this

972
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">one is already analogous thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

973
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">struggling with is how are you doing an</font>

974
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:18,100
analysis on work that hasn't done yet

975
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:20,080
the announced the use case has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

976
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:24,540
but the full solution hasn't been

977
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:31,390
specified for actn means in teas right I

978
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:34,000
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> catch your comment sorry so so</font>

979
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,650
actn is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this VN model</font>

980
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,150
right that's not happening that happened

981
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,520
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes yeah how does</font>

982
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:41,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that relate to this o VN more than you</font>

983
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,570
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> are which are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not considering</font>

984
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,160
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these we are looking at here</font>

985
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've never done and are you only</font>

986
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,850
looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also so far looking</font>

987
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,850
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the topology</font>

988
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:54,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">model okay on this interface yeah okay</font>

989
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:57,310
it would be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful to do that</font>

990
00:54:54,609 --> 00:55:00,670
sanity check and then to identify

991
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,410
anything that's missing in those models

992
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,930
yeah that's exactly what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing</font>

993
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:06,730
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think I don't</font>

994
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">think all right we have not fine missing</font>

995
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:12,280
we find something which is not clear for

996
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:14,589
example for example what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we</font>

997
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,800
noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you look at the tunnel</font>

998
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:20,080

999
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,700
label so and then we read the

1000
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,590
clarification that we have to put you

1001
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,990
you're awesome 14 they know the more for

1002
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:28,480
the node so this clarification were not

1003
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:30,459
very good we didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font>

that feedback from the teet apologize

versa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are continuing on doing</font>

1006
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,330
that analysis and it is yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1007

<font color="#E5E5E5">what have we found in the protocol</font>

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,450
in this group for the protocol specific

1010
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:45,970
we will that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to analyze the</font>

1012
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:50,319
will provide feedback to them so not

comment so basically I when we do tier

1017
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,160
tunnel model and where we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not assume</font>

1018
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,980
that it is actually provisioned by a

1020
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,650
assumption here about our addresses so

1021
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:14,770
we do not basically think in terms of

1022
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:16,960
RSVP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> euro for us it's the same key</font>

good morning mr. Bergeron Betty speaking

1031
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:51,850
and presenting the LMP draft Jeff of the

1032
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:55,780
auto first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should apologize</font>

1033
00:56:51,850 --> 00:57:00,490
weedeater because I didn't update the

1034
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:04,980
company name and second because<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1035
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:10,479
actually is not taking part of the text

00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:15,010
interface LMP work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will fix a bit</font>

1037
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:19,690
of you so the consideration for this to

1038
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:21,490
draft are related to implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olympic</font>

1039
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,970
protocol and define all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parameters</font>

1040
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:30,149
that an interface located on the client

can share with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network the</font>

1043
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:40,270
do any kind of provision is just a

1044
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:45,240
negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not a negotiation is just</font>

1045
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:49,870
a declaration of the interface

1046
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:53,250
characteristics the second draft we are

1047
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:56,920
presenting is extending also the

1048
00:57:53,250 --> 00:58:04,030
parameter to support the SS why not

1049
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:09,430
interfaces and from the previous version

is a has just been updated and did a few

1052
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:27,009
cosmetic changes while the second flex

1055
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:42,859
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing here about LMP</font>

1056
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:48,859
I just to state to clarify NP between

1057
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:52,759
the client interface that are on on

1058
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:57,339
located on Deck on the external of DW

1059
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,339
meter in d WN network and their own

1060
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:07,460
inkay in the DWDM interface LMP we have

1061
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:15,680
defined as agree in the last ITF meeting

1062
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:19,970
to manage the the application code only

1063
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:24,140
as I to the recommendation plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta</font>

1064
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:28,390
power and the current input power these

1065
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:33,440
are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameter that are enough to</font>

1066
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:39,890
let's say tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network what kind</font>

1067
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:43,480
of interface with in SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> wine extension</font>

1068
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:49,250
we have a bunch of parameter for sake of

1069
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:53,210
time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I don't I don't comment all</font>

1070
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:58,130
those parameters but I suggested or I

1071
00:59:53,210 --> 01:00:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked you to look at them the draft that</font>

1072
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:08,480
is an experimental draft is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

1073
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:12,140
normative and give us feedback so next

1074
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,930
step for the DW interface I think could

1075
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:21,410
be ready to become a working group

1076
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:25,910
document as is consolidating and also in

1077
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:29,930
the last IDF we got a good feedback but

1078
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:33,980
not negative head for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flexgrid</font>

01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:41,470
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lyrics because it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brandon</font>

01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:31,410
with a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> this lift a car saying I</font>

1088
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:35,490
would be presenting on behalf of my

colleagues at work on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100g so</font>

1090
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:40,250
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three documents which actually</font>

1091
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:43,619
we collected together at the framework

1092
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:46,650
and the den de tu solution documents

1093
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:51,000
signaling and routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1094
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:56,460
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about G ok what is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so</font>

1095
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,440
in the existing G 709 version 2012 it

1096
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,980
actually defines the<font color="#CCCCCC"> otn capabilities</font>

1097
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:05,160
and the signaling and routing extensions

1098
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:09,750
to cover that are already specified in

1099
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the RFC's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned over here in 2016</font>

1100
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:17,009
version of the g 709 beyond 100 G's

1101
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:21,480
capabilities or<font color="#CCCCCC"> otn capabilities are</font>

1102
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:24,599
introduced so since those functions are

1103
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,759
not addressed from the routing and

1104
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:29,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling perspective so here I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1105
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:31,529
talking about in the framework for

1106
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,569
example what are those new requirements

1107
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:35,130
are new capabilities and then the

1108
01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:41,009
corresponding routing and singling

1109
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:44,009
extension quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so at the framework</font>

1110
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:46,079
so there we actually have published a

1111
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:48,630
framework document listed in the

1112
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,700
reference over here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1113
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through this all the gory detail but</font>

1114
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,129
here in essentially this summarizes some

1115
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:00,000
of the new capabilities which are

1116
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:03,930
defined in g 7 a-9<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example OD UC n</font>

1117
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:09,000
signal beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100g rate and the</font>

1118
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:13,288
corresponding or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you CN as well as the</font>

1119
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,590
transport of the OD UC n over flexo in

1120
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,650
turf

1121
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:20,340
is mapping of different these signals on

1122
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:22,800
to these new containers and if another

1123
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:26,610
important new thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is introduces</font>

1124
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:28,260
a five gig granularity but you know

1125
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:32,460
times are energy this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a different</font>

1126
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:37,590
than what was so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> define in g7 70</font>

1127
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine and so so there's a maybe more</font>

1128
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,480
items here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you have more</font>

1129
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,880
detail you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can refer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the framework</font>

1130
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:49,910
document so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're captured there and</font>

1131
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:54,090
then also the actual source<font color="#CCCCCC"> d 709 okay</font>

1132
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:57,720
so okay so in the framework document we

1133
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:59,760
also list some of the use cases if you

1134
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,770
remember in the last ITF actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1135
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,260
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got to remember so some of</font>

1136
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:06,210
the use attic<font color="#E5E5E5"> was presented there so</font>

1137
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,630
this actually extends some of the use

1138
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,490
case the list we'd like to actually

1139
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:14,820
focus to take a look and give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

1140
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:19,020
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some something is missing so</font>

1141
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it actually talks about mix of different</font>

1142
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:27,030
otu links the traditional otu links and

1143
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:31,110
also there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop concept okay</font>

1144
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:34,050
that's scored all those cases and based

1145
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,970
on those use cases we think the solution

1146
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:39,570
needs to be des all those use cases when

1147
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:42,240
the solution comes up please<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look</font>

1148
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:44,100
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some use cases incorrect give</font>

1149
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,259
us a feedback or something is you know

1150
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:51,210
when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add more using its let</font>

1151
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:52,980
us know ok so then another one is based

1152
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:54,840
on the use cases actually identifies

1153
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,150
some whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is mean what solution</font>

1154
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:00,120
we need to look for so some of the

1155
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">things for example is from the routing</font>

1156
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:06,450
perspective we need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1157
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:08,940
advertise the encoding type the

1158
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:11,009
switching and determination and multiply

1159
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,410
multiplexing capabilities for this new

1160
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:15,150
links because eventually these links

1161
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">cannot be going to the cat topology</font>

1162
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:19,590
database and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to make a</font>

1163
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,290
path computation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

1164
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:24,940
signaling perspective also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

1165
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:29,349
signal types granularity<font color="#E5E5E5"> l</font>

1166
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:32,440
a VPN allocation and then basically also

1167
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:34,990
the reduced reduced rate Flinx so all

1168
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:38,380
those functionality the signaling

1169
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:40,868
solution should be able to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1170
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:42,490
keeping all these implication or the

1171
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:45,329
requirement solution of primers in mind

1172
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:47,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly go over some of the</font>

1173
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:51,190
signaling and routing extension what

1174
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:54,520
we're proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here ok so somebody off</font>

1175
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:57,270
the routing extension so as we just

1176
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention that we need to extend the</font>

1177
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:02,440
developing ospf traffic engineering

1178
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,959
capabilities so here for example we

1179
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:08,829
summarized as captured in bullet number

1180
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:12,010
two then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to extend for example</font>

1181
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:18,099
SC switching capability specific

1182
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:22,270
information field and also the is CD<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1183
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:24,730
these these this message so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1184
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:27,400
providing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> some brief as far as is CD</font>

1185
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:29,829
format is concerned we just defining

1186
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,400
this solution is defining a new encoding

1187
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:34,660
type just reusing the existing

1188
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,859
capability as there's no need for

1189
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:40,328
changing that ok if they got so sorry to

1190
01:06:38,859 --> 01:06:42,490
interrupt<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like we are really</font>

1191
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:46,060
shocking<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful you please focus on the</font>

1192
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:47,848
framework fell apart and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1193
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion on audio encoding</font>

1194
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:52,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok fine so I think the framework</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1195
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:54,280
covered i'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly flash</font>

1196
01:06:52,089 --> 01:06:55,900
through this one then so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1197
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,400
solution i'm not going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

1198
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this is thus eccentric people can</font>

1199
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,599
look in the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and similarly for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1200
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:04,810
say are signaling there's a solution

1201
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:08,740
proposed and then short of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

1202
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk here so i'm going to them</font>

1203
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:16,868
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one so if there any</font>

1204
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:18,339
comments yeah dieter nokia have a

1205
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:21,190
question for clarification are you

1206
01:07:18,339 --> 01:07:24,940
assuming that yo u CN is is which also

1207
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:26,589
layer no<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1208
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance actually so that's a one other</font>

1209
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:31,240
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually indicate this</font>

1210
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:33,910
is a non switchable at<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's an</font>

1211
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:37,240
aggregation subway right it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1212
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:38,618
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually section layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah</font>

1213
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,049
so actually I

1214
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:43,599
actually maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just just since you</font>

1215
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:46,749
asked the question so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see this built</font>

1216
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,640
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> TNS field so what we're saying is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1217
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:51,910
field must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be set to want to indicate</font>

1218
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:55,118
terminated and then s must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be set to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

1219
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:58,029
to sit non switchable so there's some

1220
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">example shown in the draft and also in</font>

1221
01:07:58,029 --> 01:08:02,049
the slide we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> show some</font>

1222
01:07:59,859 --> 01:08:03,848
different example how this dl we will be

1223
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:06,160
used for different you know different

1224
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:08,529
multiplexing cases but short of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1225
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,529
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over it also in the graph they</font>

1226
01:08:08,529 --> 01:08:14,200
are covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> John Sedlar a couple of</font>

1227
01:08:11,529 --> 01:08:15,910
comments with respect to it not being a

1228
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,339
switching layer it's not clear what the

1229
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:20,019
need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal type assignment is we</font>

1230
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:22,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a signal type assignment for</font>

1231
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:24,639
VMS layer and SDH so it's not clear they

1232
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:26,980
need here like to see that developed

1233
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:28,420
further in the framework draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do you</font>

1234
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:30,879
think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some use cases for it</font>

1235
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,279
but anyway some some development<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1236
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be good second is there is a</font>

1237
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,049
restriction on the number of TP ends

1238
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:39,759
allowed per link<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not seeing that</font>

1239
01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:43,389
strongly talked about in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft</font>

1240
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:47,710
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll not 20 which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

1241
01:08:43,389 --> 01:08:50,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">have equivalent in the regular g7 I'd</font>

1242
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:53,739
work it's 10 so you can't put as many

1243
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:55,620
links you have tributary slots or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1244
01:08:53,738 --> 01:09:02,019
signals or if you have tributary slots

1245
01:08:55,620 --> 01:09:04,870
third is the OT<font color="#E5E5E5"> you CN work flexo work</font>

1246
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,940
in itu hasn't been published yet it's

1247
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,439
still work in progress so we need to

1248
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:11,138
coordinate make certain we don't get

1249
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:12,638
ahead of their activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1250
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:15,370
agree it's work that needs to be

1251
01:09:12,639 --> 01:09:17,230
discussed here but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to</font>

1252
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:20,229
actually separate the extensions for

1253
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:22,120
that just so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get ya CN work out</font>

1254
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:23,349
first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do to use yet well I think</font>

1255
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,759
it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> well they actually in the</font>

1256
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:27,250
family you right in the framework

1257
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:29,198
document we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is TBD under</font>

1258
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,639
discussion but I think it's something at

1259
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,129
in a use case we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

1260
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:35,500
identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is reuse of like</font>

1261
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:37,000
our electrical interfaces which are

1262
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,040
existing you cannot reuse those

1263
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,569
interfaces for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the audio</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1264
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,988
and enjoy a short reach right right

1265
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:45,639
under so yes so no I'll send my comments

1266
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:50,318
to listen send your<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments a list and</font>

1267
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:50,920
we'll try to address those yeah it is

1268
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,870
good

1269
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:56,380
and I pecially was my comments already

1270
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:59,440
own list so I find the framework to

1271
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:02,380
offer you well written there's only one

1272
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:06,309
use case I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of amazing because there</font>

1273
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:09,130
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work here related to</font>

1274
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:10,929
protection switching no data<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I'm</font>

1275
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> recording signaling and everything</font>

1276
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:16,420
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth to be added</font>

1277
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,670
as well so because there are other

1278
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:20,980
indications based on the new layering

1279
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:23,080
secretly send you comes on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1280
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:25,718
did already but probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cal karo</font>

1281
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:30,179
sleep to them ok ok we will make sure

1282
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:30,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we look at it and see</font>

1283
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:47,269
okay good afternoon everyone this is how

1284
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:53,150
men and i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce a couple</font>

1285
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:55,510
of through Jesus ml9 draft also so

1286
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:58,160
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will have one framework</font>

1287
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:00,620
draft and one signaling<font color="#CCCCCC"> exterior work</font>

1288
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the other routing if they can</font>

1289
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,400
work is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also ready but it's not on the</font>

1290
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,099
agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time so I will try to</font>

1291
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:11,929
also incorporate the some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

1292
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:14,060
of this presentation so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

1293
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:18,940
the overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the history draft</font>

1294
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:22,670
actually the Liberata based on the

1295
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:27,230
refugee definition of the OT o CN and

1296
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:31,340
the addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2009 consider about</font>

01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:33,830
the beyond 100 people data plan and we

1298
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:37,280
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corresponding control</font>

plane work need to be addressed in the

1300
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:43,550
sea camp working group and the in the

1301
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:47,139
draft we took a brief review of what is

1302
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:50,780
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for Jesus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ml9 with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and</font>

1305
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:01,280
the new features<font color="#CCCCCC"> are packed so after</font>

1306
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:07,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">some analysis so we try to figure out</font>

1307
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:11,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the implications of the GM PRS signaling</font>

1308
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:14,470
and routing that need to be extended and

1309
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:19,340
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give the corresponding</font>

description of the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension so</font>

1311
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:29,600
the in the version 5 of the adidas ml9

1312
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:33,560
the new scenes including a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one new</font>

1313
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:37,010
signal type that is audio CN and there

01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:40,520
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a separate Magnus out you see of</font>

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audio k first so by analyzing</font>

1330
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:48,530
this kind of features<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font>

1331
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:51,289
this kind of signaling implications the

1332
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:53,630
firsts there are totally five issues we

1333
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:57,559
need to address you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal extension</font>

1334
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:59,599
the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to support the New York</font>

1335
01:13:57,559 --> 01:14:02,599
signal type of UCM we will add a new

1336
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:04,670
signal hype and second one is to support

1337
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:07,309
the new to be dressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and granularity</font>

1338
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:11,269
which is five people and we will also

1339
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">add one more section 444 this</font>

1340
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:18,050
granularity the third one is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

1341
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:20,059
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the RSP set up for the audio</font>

1342
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:23,539
seein containers and though<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are going</font>

1343
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:26,150
to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the should generalize the</font>

1344
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:28,369
label to support this and we will also

1345
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:33,909
extended the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TPM allocation together</font>

1346
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:33,909
with the supporting off co toc n/m and

1347
01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:39,079
for the routing implementation so we

1348
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:42,349
also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend the highest city to</font>

1349
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:45,679
describe to you how to express<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

1350
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:48,499
multiplexing and how to advertise the

1351
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">five key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to preserve start granularity</font>

1352
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:56,989
and also how to advertise fee we

1353
01:14:51,340 --> 01:15:00,769
separate out your CRM so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh what we are</font>

1354
01:14:56,989 --> 01:15:04,638
trying to give an open discussion here

1355
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:07,200
is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to first confirm with</font>

1356
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:10,590
all the experts here about the scope

1357
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:13,950
cause we<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice there are some ongoing</font>

1358
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:16,500
works including some effects oh and

1359
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:18,510
slacks ethernet some kind of this work

1360
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:22,110
which are highly related wizard you

1361
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">seein and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to confirm whether</font>

1362
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:27,990
this kind of so and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact eternity is</font>

1363
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:32,700
even in the scope or I'll have scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1364
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this draft because both of these</font>

1365
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:38,730
are part of the trees are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several nine</font>

1366
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:42,630
but we can address this kind of work

1367
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:45,929
separately you separate graphs and the

1368
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:51,720
second issue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a separate the OTO</font>

1369
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:54,840
CNN is a kind of appendix so which can

1370
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:59,040
be included<font color="#CCCCCC"> or okay should be excluded</font>

1371
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:02,340
in the draft and for the use case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1372
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,590
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> will try to add more informative</font>

1373
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:09,270
use case according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision of</font>

1374
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lascaux discussion so there</font>

1375
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a other works that's the present hit</font>

1376
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:18,240
by iftikhar and we are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1377
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:23,490
coordinate and work together with our

1378
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:25,349
other property and try to convert as

1379
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:30,540
soon as possible after that we are going

1380
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:34,110
to ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a preferred option and we can</font>

1381
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:36,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">then dropped for a single thread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off so</font>

1382
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:44,509
the solution rather than competition

1383
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:44,510
that is all of the presentation comments

1384
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess most of the comments of the</font>

1385
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:53,940
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> event a presentation also apply</font>

1386
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:59,389
this is one example is open question on

1387
01:16:53,940 --> 01:17:03,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the flex Oh factor that bitch needs to</font>

1388
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:06,360
be out of this book of the document

1389
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you we all agree with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy i</font>

1390
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:12,150
would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to keep a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flexi</font>

1391
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:14,850
dammit which has a scope of of these

1392
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:19,280
documents and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address it maybe in</font>

1393
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:21,600
another conference yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so sexy</font>

1394
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,090
can be dividing through<font color="#E5E5E5"> in through a</font>

1395
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,880
plexi over of your k and that's see or

1396
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:28,740
what you say so oh do you see maybe

1397
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,050
really related with this one we can

1398
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:36,240
mention it a little bit i'm 20 houses

1399
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:38,360
solution here and then that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1400
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,269
obvious come in philly cheese' trying to

1401
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:45,330
gamma who the the working will produce a

1402
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:47,340
single document that i see<font color="#E5E5E5"> julie you</font>

1403
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:49,110
already start<font color="#CCCCCC"> this with emergent process</font>

1404
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:52,590
at least discussing Italy together

1405
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">overdrive yeah yeah I think yeah I think</font>

1406
01:17:52,590 --> 01:18:00,450
we are contested we cannot come up with

1407
01:17:54,690 --> 01:18:02,879
one one document and also from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from</font>

1408
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:06,389
the last idea meeting i think the chairs

1409
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:09,440
emphasize the solution so that's by the

1410
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:12,930
way that's one of the reason we kind of

1411
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:15,330
speed it up this solution part because

1412
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:18,210
it was emphasized that ok let's not

1413
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry less less worried about use cases</font>

1414
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:23,670
let's talk about the solution so that's

1415
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:25,500
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i speeded up so but we are alignment</font>

1416
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:29,370
whatever the strategy we need to take

1417
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:32,330
here yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree actually I read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1418
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:35,340
the solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Johnson I think this</font>

1419
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:38,190
extension quite really simple and

1420
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:41,520
straightforward those kind of solution

1421
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:44,759
could be you know based on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesus i'm</font>

1422
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,610
on my way straight jobs actually to find

1423
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:49,920
find both Cheers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think actually we</font>

1424
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:52,469
can spend more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on the solutions and</font>

1425
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,290
not spend too much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on framework</font>

1426
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:57,450
here's hey stop yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you will be</font>

1427
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:59,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about use case which identify</font>

1428
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:03,750
which kind of use use case excuse for

1429
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:05,549
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to design the quad code under</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Spanish today I'm just mentioning that</font>

1431
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:09,989
the reason for speeding up the solution

1432
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">was we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is actually</font>

1433
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:14,099
important the group is giving a message

1434
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:18,449
that work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution rather than the</font>

1435
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:20,760
use cases a good move but since that

1436
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:23,759
there are few frameworks I mean it's

1437
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,020
better to at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> a final argument on</font>

1438
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frame or two before starting with</font>

okay in a very legal in dirty and I'm

1442
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:59,180
presenting a another experimental

1443
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:03,800
proposal we have done in collaboration

1444

with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> research center in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trento trento</font>

1446
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:15,260
this experimental work is to extend what

1447
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:18,710
what is the signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already presented</font>

1448
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:22,840
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> w.zahn network also to the SS on</font>

1449
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:28,490
network in in the specific case<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1450
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:32,480
and when the client interface is

1451
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:37,780
actually a multi-carrier interface so

1452
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:41,330
that the reason we presented this

1453
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:45,349
proposal as experimentalist because I

1454
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">tutti does not specify yet how to manage</font>

let's say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we want to F</font>

1470
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:11,369

01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">important we might have a single channel</font>

the power via OT via the optical channel

molecule basically what we want to what

1484
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:08,909
we eating how we identify the subcarrier

1485
01:23:06,419 --> 01:23:16,919
inside the media channel other than

1486
01:23:08,909 --> 01:23:20,579
having the sorry ok all other than

1487
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the value of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n and the grid and</font>

1488
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:27,148
the mediation<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier we added the</font>

01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:29,820
other two other parameters related to

the position<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the single carrier</font>

compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the central frequency of the</font>

1492
01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:44,339

01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:48,719
two new<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k that is the</font>

position as a set of the single carrier

1495
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:59,179
or the specific area compared to the n

1496
01:23:53,909 --> 01:24:05,608
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we have as many k we have</font>

1497
01:23:59,179 --> 01:24:09,210
as many subcarrier the granularity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> k</font>

1498
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:13,170
can be defined either as default value

1499
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:17,700
for example 0.1 giggles or can be

1500
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:24,060
defined as a Jay parameters that can

1501
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:30,210
have granularity a more or less 0.01

1502
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:33,960
giggles<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that during the signal we</font>

1503
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:38,460
have the n value the M value which give

1504
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:41,280
us the media channel width and a number

1505
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of K identifying inside the media</font>

1506
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:51,650
channel all the subcarrier next step is

1507
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:57,480
of course to have feedbacks on that

1508
01:24:51,650 --> 01:25:02,790
because now the technology sson

1509
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:07,099
technology is becoming ready and so some

1510
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:16,680
implementation are going to be deployed

1511
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:18,360
thanks a lot 11 comments so give

1512
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:22,830
anything actually right now you are

1513
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:26,099
making a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experimental jobs you</font>

1514
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:29,040
know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not common for us yeah</font>

1515
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:32,520
you know I think only one experimental

1516
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:35,670
for five years but<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine that you know</font>

1517
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:40,320
too many experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one year is not</font>

1518
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:43,260
common you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not usually this is</font>

1519
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">a your company's aspic things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1520
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:55,560
keep anything you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> propriety</font>

1521
01:25:46,110 --> 01:26:00,780
feature yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you are right but</font>

1522
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:03,330
again this proposal is a also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1523
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:08,250
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weather the solution</font>

1524
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be accepted once for example itt</font>

1525
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:16,140
defines the way to define the parameter

1526
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:19,320
that we are going to own to this because

1527
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:26,610
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lamberg and not know</font>

1528
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:30,540
go ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch and can't plan work</font>

1529
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:36,570
and not you know I go ahead of the eight

1530
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:40,440
I could hear a tremor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um dieter</font>

1531
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:43,369
nokia<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was wondering whether this work</font>

1532
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:47,759
you mentioned this is a the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome of a</font>

1533
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:51,179
european research project well this work

1534
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:55,380
is rather related to I RTF as opposed to

1535
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:59,040
this worthy through this we discuss this

1536
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:02,099
work in this this proposal actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1539
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:12,060
year a second question was why are you

1540
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,150
not presenting this working I RTF

1541
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:19,400
because what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose for</font>

1546
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:34,380
comment about why what we are doing here

1547
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:36,420
is we are configuring something but we

1548
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,429
have still don't know how the data plane

1549
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,969
can interoperate as far as understand

1550
01:27:38,429 --> 01:27:43,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">from people in question 6 is that</font>

1551
01:27:40,969 --> 01:27:45,119
defining the optical parameters to

1552
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:47,848
ensure interoperability the optical a

1553

list is not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy process so we are</font>

1554
01:27:47,849 --> 01:27:52,889
going too fast but we are are we going

1555
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:55,710
to the right direction because the the

1556
01:27:52,889 --> 01:27:57,840

that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I of writing a letter C</font>

[Music]

1566
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:27,360
e2e the inter operation of the top laner

1567
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:30,780
is a matter of doing tests together and

1568
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,929
there are some activity on this in this

1569
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:37,389
direction

1570
01:28:31,929 --> 01:28:40,570
so okay you ever to be specific what we

1571
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:43,920
want to make interoperable but is not

1572
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:47,650
unfeasible and we have some experiment

1573
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,959
done yes it's probably this pyramid is

1574
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:52,030
not a commercial at this parameter

1575

probability is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Masha Allah knows they're</font>

1576
01:28:52,030 --> 01:29:05,228
there experiment now but they will we go

1577
01:28:55,630 --> 01:29:07,929
in production<font color="#CCCCCC"> right generic just trying</font>

1578
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:09,489
to join the discussion has tell you

1579
01:29:07,929 --> 01:29:12,159
what's mentioning there is some

1580
01:29:09,489 --> 01:29:14,169
interoperability appearing at least when

1581
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:15,848
you split the line on the transponders

1582
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:18,369
so you don't have full interoperability

1583
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:22,719
between transponders but alien wheels

1584
01:29:18,369 --> 01:29:25,719
cases are becoming mormon common on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">is typical has written a drive for the</font>

1586
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:30,369
uni meaning between the transponder on

1587
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:34,178
the line you need this kind of work to

1588
01:29:30,369 --> 01:29:36,219
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the progresses so starting a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dealer this is not for height here I RTF</font>

1592
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:49,809
this is for products and implementations

1593
01:29:43,929 --> 01:29:53,139
so it does it is legitimate to talk

1594
01:29:49,809 --> 01:29:55,150
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here thank you we have</font>

01:30:05,349 --> 01:30:12,309
little bit later but we we have we will

1599
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:14,590
have a dedicated session answer later

1600
01:30:12,309 --> 01:30:16,179
today so I'm gonna be still five minutes

1601

1602
01:30:16,179 --> 01:30:19,329
yeah so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1603
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just going to give us a status</font>

1604
01:30:19,329 --> 01:30:24,849
update so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip for example</font>

1605
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:27,699
what what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lexi with the problem just</font>

1606
01:30:24,849 --> 01:30:29,949
give us status so we met since assault

1607
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:31,509
so we actually identified these are the

1608
01:30:29,949 --> 01:30:34,478
things which needs to be done so for

1609
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:37,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">example revised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the use</font>

1610
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:40,420
case event update requirements provide

1611
01:30:37,059 --> 01:30:42,489
more content in the framework and

1612
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:44,260
architecture section analyze the

1613
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:45,620
existing solution and start working on

1614
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:49,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so since</font>

1615
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:51,170
n so this is what had happened so we did

1616
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:54,680
revise the abstract we agree on the use

1617
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:57,860
cases actually and work we had several

1618
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:59,480
meetings including one conference call

1619
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:02,420
and a lot of discussions on the email

1620
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:05,019
and we have added information on the

1621
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:08,600
framework section publish the device

1622
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:10,730
framework as version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 and we have</font>

1623
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:14,630
started initial discussion on the

1624
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:17,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing solutions and then that's where</font>

1625
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:19,310
we are so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are following what's</font>

1626
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:21,710
happening in other s<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toews and then what</font>

1627
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:23,900
are they can new use cases like you know

1628
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:26,150
as we discuss coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you're keeping</font>

1629
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,860
an eye on those and what are the next

1630
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:31,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">steps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the next step is released to</font>

1631
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:33,230
start focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the solution and by</font>

1632
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:35,600
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea hopefully come up with the</font>

1633
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:38,299
Rajah billing solution converged

1634
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,810
consensus solution and complete the

1635
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:45,710
architecture you know framework document

1636
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:49,550
and start may be discussing on the yank

1637
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:53,630
yank models and get a feedback any

1638
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:55,340
questions comments so just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

1648
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:26,150
here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are still a few flaws</font>

we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offline but i would</font>
