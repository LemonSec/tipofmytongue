now I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> the editor of five drafts</font>

working group which is the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> specification RFC 2616 this and</font>

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,450
that's something that's urgent the

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,490
is urgent and three extensions raft

which are out of scope for this working

routing and that's something that is

urgent because home<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nets relies on that</font>

95
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,880
and unfortunately it's going to change

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,250
quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in the following weeks or</font>

there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt based routing so that's a</font>

mature specification that has been

deployed in production for a long time

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why it should</font>

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,939
completely ready that needs to be

submitted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been invited as long</font>

105
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,329
as 2616 this is not ready it would be a

106
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,550
bad idea to ask to put it in final call

107
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:16,560
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very surprising that's very</font>

108
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,290
frustrating especially for the student

109
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,390
who did the work and there's diversity

110

<font color="#CCCCCC">Beirut think that's something that I'm</font>

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's neither ready</font>

112
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:28,140
nor urgent so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to speak</font>

113
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,600
about it I'm not really happy at being

114
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,250
the editor five documents but that's

115
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens when you work with students</font>

116
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,670
so the students do the work they do some

117
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,189
brilliant work you think that's really

118
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,349
great let's write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a draft and</font>

119
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the students leave to do other fun</font>

120
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,410
stuff and you remain stuck with

121
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:52,529
job of pushing that through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF next</font>

122
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:57,059
please so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> so six one two six</font>

123
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:59,639
bits is the merger of two informational

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:09,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">are at it we are obviously doing any bug</font>

127
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:12,389
fixes to any known bugs that we found in

128
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,790
the old RFC's we're doing whatever

129
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:19,350
clarifications are deemed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be needed</font>

130
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:22,050
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided so that was Berlin</font>

131
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,949
or craig i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was Berlin where we</font>

132
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,529
decided that we allow ourselves to make

133
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,998
weekly compatible changes that's a

134
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,699
polite way of saying technically

135
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">incompatible that it doesn't matter the</font>

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:37,679
idea being is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's okay to break</font>

the letter of the informational RFC s

138
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,360
but we don't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be breaking</font>

139
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,949
deployed implementations so there's no

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> term for that I cut weekly</font>

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:59,519
about the old RFC 6126 was published in

147
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,829
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had three but every time I checked</font>

148
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,709
there is one more so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it might</font>

149
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:23,339
actually be four independent reimplement

151
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:28,649
bugs and emissions in this pack because

152
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,980
the implementation work was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

153
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,499
and it still turns out to be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

154
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:41,670
for independent implementation next

155
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:45,389
please now at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I wrote 6126 I</font>

156
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:47,309
knew I wanted a extensible protocol but

157
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:51,299
I didn't know what extensions would look

158
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:53,129
like so cut 6126 says look there space

159
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,439
here and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see anything in this</font>

160
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:57,540
space you just silently ignore it

161
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:00,959
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what the data we</font>

this peg do they actually ignore the

171
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:29,490
extension data and the answer was yes

172

the series of GL ES and it ended up not

might or might not define what the

thing to ask to merge them next please

188

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so how is 6126 progressing six one</font>

everything that looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> babel related all</font>

changes there are unicast hellos and

206

with the redefinition of updates and

207
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,460
that's tricky that needs to be done and

208
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,919
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely going to</font>

209
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:20,630
big about it in this in a second at

210
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:24,270
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so neighbor acquisition RFC</font>

211
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:27,899
6126 does not tell you when you acquire

212
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:31,020
a neighbor so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is written is</font>

213
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:33,600
that once you have dumped a neighbor in

214
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,029
your neighbor data structure you may

215
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,279
exchange routing data with them and at

216
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:42,480
no point does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it say at which point</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for that is that from the point</font>

219
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,539
of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babel it just doesn't matter</font>

220
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,340
it's a distance vector protocol the only

221
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,080
condition is if you want to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

224
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,459
very technical discussion on the mailing

225
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,320
list with four or five participants so

226
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> if any of you felt excluded</font>

227
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the nature of the things</font>

228
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,610
sometimes you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and actually</font>

229
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,059
discuss details of the data structures

230
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,459
and there was a majority opinion which

231
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,590
was to leave it vague we liked it this

232
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,409
way all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our implementations do it</font>

233
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,720
differently okay just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it vague and</font>

234
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:23,250
put some implementation advice there are

235
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">two natural points at which you can</font>

236
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,960
acquire a neighbor either the first time

237
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:31,168
you receive a well-formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babel packet</font>

238
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,080
from a node the other opportunity is the

239
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:39,120
first time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to parse a hello</font>

240
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,010
TLD from a given node okay and that so

241
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,709
just say that those are the two natural

242
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:47,490
places but they all that this pack is

243
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,429
going to say is you must acquire a

244
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,580
neighbor in a timely manner and there

245
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,159
was a minority opinion very vocal that

246
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:59,399
minority opinion which was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify</font>

247
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,529
precisely to use a finite state

248
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,779
automaton<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly at which</font>

249
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:06,600
point what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol for acquiring</font>

250
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:09,980
a neighbor and this apparently fixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

251
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,959
security problem with hmm based security

252
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,820
so my reading of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

253
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,909
happen to belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font>

254
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,740
is to leave it vague and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

255
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:23,460
I'm considering and I would like some

256
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,900
opinions on that is to allow extensions

257
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,210
to tighten the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules</font>

258
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,670
on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand it would make H max</font>

259
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,890
security happy on the other hand I'm not

260
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,020
really comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the notion to</font>

261
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,150
say look this is a basic procedure the

262
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,710
protocol oh by the way extensions can

263
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:42,300
change it so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if there</font>

264
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,040
are any other opinions that hopeless

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,600
already expressed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list I would</font>

266

267
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:58,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">um to slightly say differently what</font>

268
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,640
you're saying I'm fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

270
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority opinion is to say that if</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H mac-based security has a</font>

272
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,080
requirement to tighten something up that

273
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,140
document should define that I don't

274
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,879
think we should allow them to modify how

275
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,830
things work but slightly constraining

276
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,780
more in a way that is compatible what

277
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,879
the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> document seems okay as in</font>

278
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,649
extensions can say by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

it doesn't that is exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me</font>

286
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,120
uncomfortable because it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

287
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,280
some implementations it will be more

difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> than for others to implement H</font>

289
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,430
max security oh I don't worry so the

290
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">point here is that you expect an</font>

291
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,390
extension to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

292
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,170
add to your implementation whatever the

293
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,060
implementation choices you made if

294
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,250
implementing an extension requires you

295
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,110
to redo your implementation from scratch

296
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,810
although you did obey the original

297
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:16,889
protocol then I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a badly</font>

298
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:18,810
designed extension I can't disagree with

299
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,070
that would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be possible in this</font>

300
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,020
particular case I need to remember

301
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,770
through it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while that to change</font>

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the itch mac-based security to work</font>

303
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,480
given that vagueness and that other

304
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,210
platoons were different way we don't you

305
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,650
would have to look more into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it no idea</font>

306
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,480
somebody would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to as a second</font>

307
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,470

at a track security

309
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:47,130
it's a hint I can take a look to be

310
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,890
clear that it is I am NOT a security

311
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,750
expert so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say what might work I</font>

312
00:23:49,890 --> 00:24:03,360
can't give you security properties or

313
00:23:51,750 --> 00:24:05,250
something yeah the one thing I know

314
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,340
about security is that I don't know

315
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,340
enough about securities once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again sorry</font>

[Music]

317
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,100
if you want a real security review of

318
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,750
anything send it to the security

319
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,879
Directorate I mean the chair should be

320
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,120
able to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would be able</font>

321
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get us some feedback probably I mean</font>

322
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,830
I could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it first if we want to</font>

323
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,750
look for low hanging fruit but I assume

324
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:41,449
it was written by somebody who knows 80%

325
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,450
about security two or more

326
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,920
I mean I was so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

327
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,629
details but one of the ways that

328
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,100
sometimes we do specifications you might

329
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:01,080
say a the output or the result has to

330
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,790
conform to what would be if the

331
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,620
implementation we're doing this

332
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,600
algorithm or this finite state machine

333
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,790
so the outputs have to be compatible but

334
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,189
the internal logic doesn't have to be I

335
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that type of approach</font>

336
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,630
might help with the gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't looked at the requirement repeat</font>

338
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:21,810
please sometimes we specify that an

339
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,010
implementation has to have an output

340
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,870
that looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results of as if the</font>

341
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,910
implementation had run this finite state

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,280
machine it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

machine it just has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be compatible</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with in well-defined ways I don't know</font>

345
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,879
if that would help finesse here<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz i</font>

346
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,889
have it looked at the details<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

348
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,580
problem is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't redo</font>

349
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,160
neighbor acquisition at the right time

350
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,120
you become vulnerable to replace and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

not really I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I'm not I'm not</font>

353
00:25:52,980 --> 00:26:05,460
wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say too much next</font>

354
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:08,340
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so Babel so I've tried to</font>

355
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,060
design Babel<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a rather robust protocol</font>

356
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:15,060
and by robust here I mean that no matter

357
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">how bad an implementer you are you're</font>

358
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:21,990
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break much because the</font>

359
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:24,780
protocol is resistant to all sorts of

360
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,570
implementation errors and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

361
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,460
bit so I've tried in<font color="#E5E5E5"> many cases there is</font>

362
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,620
a big temptation to the tricky

363
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,770
optimizations in a protocol I've tried

364
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to refrain as much as possible and you</font>

365
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,550
know that I work with students who I was

366
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,679
under a lot of and students like to be

367
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,470
smart so you know that I was under a lot

368
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,960
of pressure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be too smart for the good</font>

369
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:49,020
at the protocol and I'm proud to say

370
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,540
that most of the time I'm refrained from

371
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,900
being smart and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one bit that I</font>

372
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,000
didn't manage to make as robust as I

373
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,090
want there is one bid that is actually

374
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,470
tricky it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to send requests so for</font>

375
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,059
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,780
common for people who are not familiar

377
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,460
with the protocol there are some search

378
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,158
circumstances in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babel is starving</font>

379
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,990
knows that it does have roots but is not

380
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,870
allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them because of the loop</font>

381
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,669
avoidance protocol and at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

382
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,219
will send some requests which is

383
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:25,070
somewhat similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eigrp active phase</font>

384
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:28,470
but completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this bit i</font>

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">re-read it multiple times and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

pack it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely terribly written</font>

388
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,270
and to my great surprise even that is

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,370
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough for independently</font>

issues i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit too</font>

prescriptive so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to make it a</font>

399
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,590
little bit more permissive<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

400
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:06,330
proof that it remains correct I don't

401
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,049
have a proof that this is actually the

402
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:12,539
minimum requirement but I have I'm

403
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:14,340
pretty sure we're pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

404
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum requirements that should be no</font>

405
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:22,830
problem and I've described it all in an

406
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:26,250
email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailings next please okay</font>

407
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:29,610
unicast hellos so one of the design

408
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,820
criterion<font color="#CCCCCC"> babble is that all tlds can be</font>

409
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:35,699
sent over unicast or over multicast

410
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,879
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sending them over unicast</font>

411
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,340
or multicast is purely an implementation

412
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,789
detail and you deal with it like you

413
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">want with one exception the hello tlv so</font>

414
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,330
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural to have that hellos be</font>

415
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,250
sent over multicast because halos are

416
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,960
used for discovery but once you've

417
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,900
discovered your neighbors you might want

418
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,510
to send hellos over unicast and you

419
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,200
cannot do that they cannot do that first

420
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:03,780
because I say so in 6126 I say must not

421
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,059
you know in capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> and capital letters</font>

422
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,870
and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really must not and</font>

423
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,870
the other reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that if you do then</font>

424
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,379
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send a hello to one</font>

425
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,270
neighbor and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

426
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,300
however hellos carry a sequence number

427
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,300
in the sequence number is / interface so

428
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:28,590
you'll end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decentralization</font>

three active implementers so things have

432
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,770
evolved since i wrote the slides last

what we did and what I was attempting to

444
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,389
propose in the mail I said but maybe

445
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,139
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear enough is that every time</font>

446
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,360
we would have sent to broadcast hello

447
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,940
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current implementation</font>

448
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,310
we serialized so we sent to every pier

449
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,160
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface a hello every time</font>

450
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:28,919
whether it was because of an interval

451
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,720
whether it was because uh it was

452
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,280
triggered somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time we were going</font>

broadcast under the normal

455

457
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:43,230
simplistic but it works and it doesn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">change the protocol at all right the</font>

459
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,540
important bit here is that you are

460
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:51,060
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hello either to all neighbors</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on a good an internet interface or not</font>

462
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,060
exactly you're not risking the

synchronizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC knows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were simply</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated but and that's perfectly</font>

469
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,220
correct now my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so that is one</font>

470
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,379
possibility to say that in 606 this now

471
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,070
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is this ambitious enough</font>

472
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,900
or do you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

473
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,030
send a hello to one neighbor and of the

474
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,280
other I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> your point about I hear</font>

475
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,190
yours was good was it was a good point

476
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,990
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be pasta</font>

477
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,270
to include the I hear you to the

478
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,040
neighbor it applies to and send the

479
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,110
hello to the other neighbors on the same

480
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,930
link at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time without the I hear</font>

481
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,120
you but my proposal doesn't actually say

482
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and we probably should but other</font>

483
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,909
than that that's what I was proposing

484
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,280
because that's what we implemented so I

485
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works i'd be willing to</font>

486
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:54,780
discuss other things but I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

487
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:57,090
them work Donald sharp so when I

488
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,820
implement it remote neighbors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ER</font>

489
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:03,060
grp actually made it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could</font>

490
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">send unicast hello just so so that I</font>

491
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:10,620
could get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet to whoever I wasn't</font>

492
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,960
trying to talk to do you have concerns

493
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,639
about having neighbors that aren't one

494
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:21,270
hop away more than one hop away and

495
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:26,000
double not need your GP I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you can</font>

496
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,000
fudge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so what I've been doing is</font>

497
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:33,930
trying trying to refrain<font color="#CCCCCC"> from doing</font>

498
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:36,450
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users are not asking for</font>

499
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:41,640
and so all I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say that none of</font>

500
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:44,220
the users have asked for that none of

we can't hear you oh no we press the

508
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:25,519
is your microphone on well we could

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,529
into jabber was question for you

517
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,690
Margaret which is what if you have a mix

518
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:56,389
of multicast and unicast capable

519
00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:01,759
receivers and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you signal other</font>

520
00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:05,120
nodes you are unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask capable um I</font>

521
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean my implementation currently</font>

522
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,368
it's it's a very specialized

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,509
implementation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually for a</font>

524
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:14,720
different use it's actually for an

525
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:20,629
amphib related protocol and it runs over

529
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:33,799
multicast related anything there are

530
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:36,530
also non multicast networks my guess is

531
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're probably not going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:47,299
would it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in either or but if</font>

someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with a real-life use</font>

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,899
case where people needed to support both

i'd be happy to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot of thought</font>

539
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:56,179
but right now i'm not sure what the use

540
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,020
case would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support some unicast</font>

neighbors and some multicast neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

542
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,470
mean if you had peer-to-peer neighbors

543
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,030
they're just another interface right

544
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,069
like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't come up with one where</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i've got a group of unicast neighbors on</font>

the same interface and a group of

in an existing network so those were a

00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:56,058
does its own stuff too but I can see

562
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,190
like at least from what I've been

hearing about the current fable

573
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:28,430
in your periodic multicast hellos that

574
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:30,230
are those are used for discovery you

575
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,078
could have a bit saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support this</font>

576
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,540
and then have a separate set of sequence

577
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,040
numbers and I think that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good</font>

578
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,630
enough I had thought about this but I

579
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,630
haven't reread my nose so I could be

580
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we definitely need to get in</font>

581
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:50,480
there into a room I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say unicast</font>

582
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:53,419
hellos have no sequence number just an

583
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,030
interval the sequence number is for

584
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,980
extra robustness if you change the

585
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">interval I would have a minimalistic</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone has a requirement unless anyone</font>

589
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,910
has a natural requirement of having data

00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:23,359
and unicast hellos<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would make the</font>

unicast hello a tiny tiny packet with no

592
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,930
data or was just an interval depending

593
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:33,920
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

594

595
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,589
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> short pointment good another thing</font>

596
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd done some point when</font>

597
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,328
implantation was that just receiving a

598
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,578
unicast message from someone what I

599
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,809
would treat it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello and if u hello</font>

600
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:49,880
just doesn't care anything else that

601
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:51,890
would be similar and brass<font color="#CCCCCC"> Weidman 10 as</font>

602
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,109
a matter of fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> many routing protocols</font>

603
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,848
do consider any packet received from the

604
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:58,808
neighbor as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hallo even if it's not</font>

605
00:37:55,849 --> 00:38:01,400
technically hello so some protocols like

606
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:04,339
eigrp will actually send what is

607
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,619
effectively minky unicast packet because

608
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:08,869
it knows the other then we'll go oh that

609
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,700
was a below<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep this guy alive so</font>

610
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:21,890
it's not even defined as a whole lot per

se sorry dates<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ganassi but I do like the</font>

612
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:25,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of an empty hello because just</font>

613
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,770
somewhere down the road that means that

00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's explicitly defined for what it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so integration of sick of 65 57 and</font>

620
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:56,930
26 126 conceptually easy editorially

621
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:59,150
tricky there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> three attempts so</font>

622
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:01,490
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was very helpful by Toki</font>

623
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm very grateful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Toki because</font>

624
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:08,118
you showed me what doesn't work that if

625
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,828
you just took 7557 did some editing of

626
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff and put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a separate</font>

627
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:15,680
section which seemed like a good idea

628
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:17,690
and it turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not read very well</font>

629
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,529
because you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a document that</font>

630
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,990
says here you have the TL<font color="#CCCCCC"> v's here there</font>

631
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:26,359
is nothing oh by the way I lied to you

632
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,729
earlier there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sub judice at this</font>

633
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,549
point so what I wanted was to integrate

634
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:33,440
the sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> gld format at the right point in</font>

635
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:36,440
the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried that in</font>

636
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,839
December that's at them too and I

637
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,270
started editing the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font>

638
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,400
point it was a complete mess and so I

639
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,770
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to fix the nests and</font>

640
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,870
that's

641
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,720
pointed got so bad that I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

642
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:51,029
throw everything out and to quit and to

643
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,839
abandon my job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me for holidays</font>

644
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:57,930
and so I tried again recently and this

645
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,020
time so I let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work in my brain and</font>

646
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this time I got something that works it</font>

647
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,090
does read correctly except that it feels

648
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,000
a little bit like you know an American

649
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:11,460
series from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1970s like Dallas or</font>

650
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,220
dynasty<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something like that where you</font>

651
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,830
go and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of drama</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like</font>

652
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the format of TL vs and everyone</font>

653
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,790
is crying and having his text and then

654
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,710
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end you say oh by the way you</font>

655
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,500
resolve the trauma by saying by the way

656
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,430
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't define any sub GL v's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

657
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,560
document so except for the somewhat

658
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:33,960
imbalance it does appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work pretty</font>

659
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,330
well and I didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time before</font>

660
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cutoff to send it to you all will do</font>

661
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:44,910
pretty sit next please so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I tell</font>

662
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,850
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the semi compatible changes</font>

663
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,500
that we are planning I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

664
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,110
quick digression about source-specific

665
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,380
routing not going to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's or</font>

666
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:58,410
specific routing is but it's the best

667
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,550
things and somebody invented next-hop

668
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:04,319
routing it is the most exciting

669
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,930
extension that we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Babel it is</font>

670
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,030
with the work of matoub<font color="#E5E5E5"> G my grad</font>

671
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,790
student and that is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

672
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,780
very very excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works</font>

673
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:17,790
beautifully well in Babel it is a

674
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,710
production-ready implementation there

675
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,950
are a few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are deploying it in</font>

676
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:26,940
real networks and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> package format is</font>

677
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:30,120
an absolute mess we define three new

678
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">TLDs and trust me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tvs are not</font>

679
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,190
pretty at all they have way too many

680
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:38,400
fields they resemble nothing like the

681
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:41,670
other TL DS in Babel implementing it is

682
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,590
impossible to decode them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> site they</font>

683
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,690
are even after working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

684
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:50,970
months and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not a pretty</font>

685
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:53,580
sight next please and so we would like

686
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the packet format and one</font>

687
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,720
thing would be to add a mandatory bit to

688
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,119
sub deities

689
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,939
okay so have the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffics</font>

690
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,760
information for specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appear</font>

691
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,340
is a subtlety of the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> update tlv</font>

692
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,220
but marked with a mandatory bit so that

693
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,980
if you don't understand this sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> T lvu</font>

694
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop the whole tlv and that doesn't make</font>

695
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,430
me comfortable doesn't fit well into

696
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Babel it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not obvious what the</font>

697
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,080
semantics of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mandatory bit would be</font>

698
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,090
in Babel and especially there is a

699
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,130
problem is that you can no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parsa</font>

700
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:29,220
packet sequentially because if you find

701
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,840
Anna subtly a mandatory bit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

702
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,790
don't understand suddenly you have to

703
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll back all the changes you ma'am you</font>

704
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,890
made since you started parsing the tlv

705
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,540
not a problem if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're clean at</font>

706
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,580
implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code because you're</font>

707
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,290
building a data structure but if you're

708
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,080
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on the fly because you're</font>

709
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,080
me then it is an actual implementation

710
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,900
problem the other solution is to use the

711
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:56,580
AE mechanisms which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> already in battle</font>

712
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:59,040
next please so every update and request

713
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,890
in Babel carries a one octet field known

714
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,080
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and codec so think of it</font>

715
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,660
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the address family it's a field</font>

716
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:11,819
that tells you this is ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 or I</font>

717
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:13,560
tvpad however<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh it's I don't call it an</font>

718
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,480
address family because it carries some

719
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,509
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information you can say things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

720
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a compressed ipv6 link local</font>

721
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,470
address without the fe 80 prefix and

722
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:25,770
stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

723
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:28,879
encoding of an address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the idea here</font>

724
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be to recode source-specific</font>

725
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:37,470
routing by using a new I UAE for source

726
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:42,720
specific updates and requests that's

727
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">pleasing so what that means is that you</font>

728
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,279
no longer have three new<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLDs you have</font>

729
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero new TLDs just a new Eddie e value</font>

730
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,589
but you need changes to the bay

731
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:59,760
specification because updates have two

732
00:43:55,589 --> 00:44:03,000
rigid a format right now for to be able

733
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to carry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sore specific updates and you</font>

734
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,570
need to define very precisely how

735
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,310
address compression I don't want get

736
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:15,480
into the details works with unknown<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES</font>

737
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:18,270
so we've got there's three of us having

738
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion back in Paris and that</font>

739
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,680
doesn't prevent us from having almost

740
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,450
three different opinions which is pretty

741
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">good and we've already managed to have</font>

742
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,970
for opinions<font color="#CCCCCC"> well there were three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

743
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:32,400
um one opinion which is the current

744
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">favorite and the due to mature booty so</font>

745
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,340
he's convinced me is to make the payload

746
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:41,040
of updates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack so an update just says</font>

747
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,900
there is some data after the header if

748
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,930
you don't understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID just skip</font>

749
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole tlv and no structure at all so</font>

750
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that is that you have</font>

751
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> parse every single AE separately the</font>

752
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,729
other problem with that is that you

753
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,500
cannot parse the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub T lbs of tlv that</font>

754
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:02,160
you understand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't understand</font>

755
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,410
the AE the nice side is that it's very

756
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">flexible the other opinion which was</font>

757
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:12,089
originally mine is to make it as precise

758
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:15,480
as possible to encode both sore specific

759
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:18,210
updates and normal updates and then we

760
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,820
recently the team was joined by an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AC</font>

761
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,530
student Wendell in schwann and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gwendolen</font>

762
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,180
has been there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for two weeks but that</font>

763
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,130
doesn't prevent her from already

764
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,500
disagreeing from us which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

765
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,730
sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's saying just stop with the</font>

766
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,340
skull<font color="#E5E5E5"> AE mess just use a mandatory bit</font>

767
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:39,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok Gwendoline has be cheeky experience</font>

768
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:41,250
from the previous internship and so

769
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,320
since we're disagreeing that probably

770
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,860
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need more data we need</font>

771
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,690
more examples of the use of AE and that

772
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,800
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gwendolyn is currently working on</font>

773
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,590
TOS rooting for Babel and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

774
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,470
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer gets encoded if the people who</font>

775
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:04,350
are working on beer was for babel are

776
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:06,410
interested in that when I am learned

777
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:11,819
about this yesterday I actually thought

778
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:13,350
that the mandatory bit was right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok even</font>

779
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">though you were saying you thought the</font>

780
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,650
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was right but then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

781
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:22,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to read over the whole document since</font>

782
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:25,029
then and it occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

783
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,880
don't know the AE

784
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:29,979
then I mean you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just going to run</font>

785
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Babel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the point is to run Babel</font>

786
00:46:29,979 --> 00:46:33,279
so you can have information about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

787
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:35,439
forward packets what direction to

788
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:40,479
forward packets in but if you don't know

789
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:41,919
the AE for a particular type of route

790
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:44,140
you're not going to know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

791
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packets anyway are you so I</font>

792
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,038
think it's perfectly fine to make it

793
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,199
opaque and it's like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

794
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:52,119
a you process it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you don't</font>

795
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:53,709
because how are you going to know what

796
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it for if it's for an address</font>

797
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:58,719
family you don't understand I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so</font>

798
00:46:56,979 --> 00:47:02,890
the name so i changed my opinion since

799
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:05,469
yesterday to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it opaque so the main</font>

800
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:09,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is do you need to be able to</font>

801
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:12,999
parse FTL these of an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlv with an</font>

802
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:16,150
AE that you don't understand that's the

803
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:17,769
main issue and I dates<font color="#CCCCCC"> kanazawa and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

804
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally agree and same like my</font>

805
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:23,288
implementation doesn't support ipv4 and

806
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,049
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> their update elect sub theories of</font>

807
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">any kind of all like fancy properties of</font>

808
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:30,849
this ipv4 address I like what am I going

809
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:34,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do with them like is there an example</font>

810
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:37,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a case where this dis address that</font>

811
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:39,549
does something but with extensions we

812
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:42,369
only want the extensions like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

813
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:45,729
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever happening or or did you</font>

814
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:47,589
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea in mind and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad</font>

815
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,598
if you forwarded them to other people

816
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:51,699
implying you could forward those packets

817
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:57,150
because you can't so the best thing to

818
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is not put them in your table I agree</font>

819
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:11,349
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's the end that's</font>

820
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:13,328
all I have to say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6126 this for</font>

821
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:17,609
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you a few words</font>

822
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:17,609
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> babble applicability statement</font>

823
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:46,269
five mins ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh thank isn't the</font>

824
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:58,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">queue we still can't hear you can you</font>

825
00:48:46,269 --> 00:49:01,538
tap in the Java please what Dave said on

826
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:03,969
the jabber is AE is good I do kind of

827
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:06,819
think we end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than one new</font>

828
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:12,939
AE do we end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mirror image of</font>

829
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:18,249
the existing for AES and by the way Toki

830
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:21,999
says bird will also drop the entire tlv

831
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:26,529
if it doesn't understand the AE dave

832
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:30,339
says AE for sake of argument mpls what

833
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:42,279
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes are possibly needed thanks</font>

834
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:44,799
Barbara one David's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ignasi won't put a</font>

835
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:47,079
would like to add and we can discuss it

836
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline is this only works if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

837
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,069
restrict the address encoding

838
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:52,329
compression to be specific to an

839
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:55,058
encoding which i think is what you

840
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:57,339
wanted to do absolutely absolutely that

841
00:49:55,059 --> 00:50:00,539
requires some very careful looking at

842
00:49:57,339 --> 00:50:03,219
compatibility with unknown a tease yeah

843
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:05,499
ok so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Babel applicability statement</font>

844
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:07,659
at some point I discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> my great</font>

845
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:09,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">horror that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to write an</font>

846
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:12,399
applicability that an applicability

847
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:14,820
statement was desired by the IETF for

848
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:16,589
babel so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has so</font>

849
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,720
this applicability statement has a long

850
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,000
history the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first version was one</font>

851
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,339
sentence longer it said it's a routing

852
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,980
protocol its roots and that was

853
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,650
considered as too short so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I wrote</font>

854
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,690
a document that I called Babel doesn't

855
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,540
care and that was considered too funny

856
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,220
and then I wrote the last version which

857
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,259
I called applicability statement and

858
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was considered too sober so I'm</font>

859
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to spend a few minutes telling you</font>

860
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:45,000
about my literary experiences with the

861
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:48,529
applicability statement next please so

862
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,830
my first version was one sentence longer

863
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:56,580
it said it's a routing protocol for

864
00:50:52,830 --> 00:51:00,840
goodness sake its roots and the friendly

865
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:02,910
ad consider that it was too<font color="#CCCCCC"> short I</font>

866
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,790
think she mentioned that while

867
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:10,710
technically correct this is somewhat do

868
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:13,259
short so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to make a two-sentence</font>

869
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,270
long but well the ad is friendly I was

870
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,630
afraid she might no longer find it funny

871
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:20,759
at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I spend a whole Sunday</font>

872
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:24,120
afternoon reading applicability

873
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,510
statements next please so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

874
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you've ever send a whole afternoon</font>

875
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,860
reading applicability statements it has

876
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:34,649
an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your brain it does change</font>

877
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:37,350
you and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point i sat down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

878
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 a.m.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had produced a document that</font>

879
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:42,569
was called Babel doesn't care and this

880
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:45,510
document i sent i submit it straight

881
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:49,380
away before I could think it over as an

882
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,330
internet draft and you know i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

883
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,040
do you know like english language books

884
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,890
than to heaven the dust cover those

885
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,009
made-up quotations so those are not made

886
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:02,490
up those are authentic so one of the

887
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:07,050
quotations was this is the best IETF

888
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:11,580
draft ever that was not Donald Trump

889
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:14,430
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different dt here and the other</font>

890
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,920
comment by someone whose initials are TL

891
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,450
is reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of the honey badger so if</font>

892
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about the honey badger</font>

893
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,279
after this meeting is over<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

894
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,500
over to youtube and type<font color="#E5E5E5"> like honey</font>

895
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,260
badger and another person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was</font>

896
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,540
actually helpful sent me a long

897
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">email trying to be polite but you felt</font>

898
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:37,110
the irritation between the lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

899
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:40,320
said look it's not an applicability

900
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:43,800
statement you're just bragging it's

901
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,140
funny but really you're just bragging so

902
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,580
I read it I was really quite frustrated

903
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,190
by this comment that's not a nice thing

904
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:54,090
because I'm a very modest person or like

905
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:57,140
the thing so and so I read through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

906
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:00,960
and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn he's right next please</font>

907
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:03,330
and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going to write a</font>

908
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,630
very sober document and I wrote an

909
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:10,160
extremely sober document called Babel

910
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:13,950
applicability statement how sad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

911
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:17,370
this in this document I swear I didn't

912
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:21,000
do any bragging at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just soberly</font>

913
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:24,540
described existing deployments of Babel

914
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,090
and this document spent quite a few

915
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">months maturing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their ATF archives</font>

916
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:33,420
and then I called Donald and said look

917
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,460
what do we do is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Donal did the</font>

918
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,590
typical don't think which consisted in

919
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:42,090
sending in straight away for final call

920
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:45,240
and there was a review next please and

921
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,860
there was an extremely helpful review by

922
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,529
someone I didn't know Alexander

923
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:51,150
Weinstein did a great job so it's a long

924
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,300
review because he's trying to be polite

925
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:57,240
but if you remove all the Bedford<font color="#CCCCCC"> keeper</font>

926
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:00,060
he's trying it not to wound my feelings

927
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:04,709
the main three points he's making is

928
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:06,870
that she needs an introduction he needs

929
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,390
a more precise data about the existing

930
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:13,170
deployments and he wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

931
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:16,200
extensions are being used so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I strongly</font>

932
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:19,530
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> points1 entry here this</font>

933
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,330
document needs an introduction and this

934
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,520
document needs more information about

935
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:26,310
the extensions I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

936
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,890
disagree with want to it would be a good

937
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:31,440
idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work not</font>

938
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,509
only getting the precise quantitative

939
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,270
data but convincing the people who

940
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:39,360
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle that I'm allowed to</font>

941
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:41,190
publish their quantitative data so going

942
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,819
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I am going to take into</font>

943
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,609
account

944
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:47,038
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it only the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

945
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:50,130
effort necessary remains reasonable

946
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,130
Julius<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is russ from 1pm of my</font>

947
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:56,940
chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say normally in the</font>

948
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:58,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITF process precise data about existing</font>

949
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">deployments is not something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

950
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,469
would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when I think of an</font>

951
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,899
applicability statement it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I</font>

952
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:07,410
would think of when I think of an

953
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience with protocol X draft so I</font>

954
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,699
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're perfectly safe leaving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

955
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:14,279
out of this document until a more

956
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:17,160
experienced that is more open that can

957
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:18,839
be discussed is available in writing a

958
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,410
completely separate document at that

959
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:25,170
time called an experience with federal

960
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:27,390
deployments document when that time

961
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:34,019
comes I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you need it for this</font>

962
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:36,239
document personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could Donald up</font>

963
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:37,410
so I believe this Terrace in this was

964
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,799
that there was not really enough

965
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:43,319
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to birth would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you call and but</font>

966
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:45,869
so I thought ish we modified and do

967
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:48,119
another version of us call based after

968
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:50,369
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed dude who's watching this</font>

969
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:57,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">conical made that might remember that's</font>

970
00:55:50,369 --> 00:56:02,670
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this dad is to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

971
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:05,579
so next please so the plan here is to

972
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:10,109
have a complete draft of six one two six

973
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:13,979
bits by Prague and the two things that

974
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:17,308
worry me are the unicast hello but and

975
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:22,529
the redefinition of updates so that also

976
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:24,599
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d'Alene's work we also</font>

977
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:27,509
plan for a complete draft of the

978
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:30,809
applicability statement in crag and the

979
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:33,239
main and the main stumbling block here

980
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:35,609
is that it's extremely boring work

981
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:41,209
especially if i'm not allowed to brag

982
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:44,848
and we will hopefully have a new draft

983
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:46,890
of SAR specific routing with the new

984
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:49,319
encoding and depending on how

985
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:52,529
gwendolyn's work does goes we might have

986
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">a draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for TOS routing so when i'm</font>

987
00:56:52,529 --> 00:56:55,109
saying here is that we are aiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

988
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,170
it in

989
00:56:55,109 --> 00:57:00,630
I have so there are of course the

990
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:02,279
official deadlines of the ITF but there

991
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,769
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another deadline for me that in</font>

992
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:06,690
September teaching starts and that means

993
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:09,419
I'm completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of circulation for</font>

994
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,519
any stuff except teaching so for me it's

995
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,920
a vital thing to get all of this done

996
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:18,538
before july thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for</font>

997
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:24,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention thank you any further</font>

998
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:24,980
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> are coming ok</font>

999
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:39,880
so next is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a top on multicast gentlemen</font>

1000
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:09,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">boo boo laughs no I'm some pizza from</font>

1001
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:16,220
the key this option I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share my</font>

1002
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea about much custer pebble extension</font>

1003
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:26,309
I just many questions about if we will

1004
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:30,710
use much castellina small netbook but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1005
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have explicit answer about the</font>

1006
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:37,799
first four questions because we do need

1007
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic husband or network and the V</font>

1008
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:46,470
will we want to simple the network

1009
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:49,829
deployment to which is a bitch mutual

1010
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:55,319
which by which of us which which all of

1011
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:59,309
our sorry which our goals so in last

1012
00:58:55,319 --> 00:59:03,808
meeting I presented the beer extension

1013
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:08,430
in vivo and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it had been who the</font>

1014
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:13,650
disgust and about the deployment and

1015
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:18,779
many people things things think it is

1016
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:23,490
beautiful and now the question comes the

1017
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:27,990
problem coming and we know if we want to

1018
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:31,379
deploy here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

1021
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,910
we mustered wrong Mr D to transfer the

00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:44,160
overlay information the information

1023
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:48,598
includes matic has the search the

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:53,220

1033
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:27,540
don't I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea about it so so this</font>

1034

<font color="#E5E5E5">is my idea about it I wanted to have</font>

1035
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:35,640

01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:46,379
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense so the solution is</font>

1038
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:51,540
very simple we only use one protocol in

1039
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:54,240
network just as people Bible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we use</font>

1040
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:56,250
pebble to view the beer multicast the

01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,979
forwarding plane and it's the same time

1042
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:02,070
we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to advertise both cast</font>

it's the looter data is near<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sauce</font>

HR collects the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> of air hrs</font>

1054
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:46,490
and the buttes mapping relationship

1055
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:51,450
between multicast follow and the beer

1056
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:53,339
destination bit stream and the the

1057
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:56,939
formatting is very simple because we

1058
01:01:53,340 --> 01:02:00,270
only use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> curvy of the pebble</font>

1059
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,040
critics so we advertise the group at

1060
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">address and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of a Prius lineage</font>

1061
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:09,540
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sausages may be 0 because we</font>

1062
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,630
some receiver only know I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1063
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:16,740
receive some group and I don't know the

1064
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:23,060
source so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are senator and sub Q</font>

1065
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:23,060
is only the group yes no sauce yes

1066
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:32,980
and so this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi Custer small</font>

1067
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:40,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network and they're a job you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1068
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:46,480
may be many hrs and hy f how epic I know

1069
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:50,710
who the who is who as the air hrs so and

1070
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:54,130
we use pebble update message to transfer

1071
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:58,600
the multicast source information and the

1072
01:02:54,130 --> 01:03:01,090
global information and the the prefix

1073
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,580
must not be summarized so this

1074
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:06,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">information can be transferred to every</font>

1075
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:11,350
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network and the potentially</font>

1076
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:17,369
sauce or<font color="#E5E5E5"> fhr will know the potential</font>

1077
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:21,880
receivers so it will imagine the air hrs

1078
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:25,090
it's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient into the beer stream</font>

1079
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,950
the beer bit stream so it depending up

1080
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:30,850
so late is a packet and the transfer to

1081
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:36,160
all the receivers so it's a very simple

1082
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:38,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea and you have any comments that's</font>

1083
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,279
all

1084
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:49,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so I've read both versions of your a</font>

1085
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:52,520
draft and the so I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1086
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:56,000
your last presentation on the subject

1087
01:03:52,520 --> 01:04:00,590
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> babble does not have a notion</font>

1088
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,840
of a transitive optional subfield<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1089
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not something you can encode in</font>

1090
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:09,020
Babel because simply the transitive bit

1091
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:11,030
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist right so you need to find</font>

1092
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different encoding and that is what I</font>

1093
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,530
mentioned when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was speaking earlier</font>

1094
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:18,200
about the fact about updates is that we

1095
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:21,890
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process of trying to find</font>

1096
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:25,430
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the right way to encode that</font>

1097
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:26,540
this car kind of information in Babel so

1098
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:30,319
perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll come to the conclusion</font>

1099
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:32,750
that we do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory and transitive</font>

1100
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:35,000
this but our current thinking right now

1101
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,460
is that this can be done with a

1102
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,540
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> AE number now if you look at</font>

1103
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:42,470
this slide that's what you're writing

1104
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:47,450
here you're saying look I'm encoding

1105
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:50,990
this as a graphics yeah but this prefix

1106
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:53,270
it's weird it has different semantics

1107
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to aggregate it so</font>

1108
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually it looks like a perfect but</font>

1109
01:04:55,130 --> 01:05:01,010
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a graphics right so that</font>

1110
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:05,240
would seem to imply<font color="#E5E5E5"> that saying UAE</font>

1111
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:07,400
number that it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be encode that</font>

1112
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,379
like this the other comment if you can

1113
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:15,740
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the previous slide the one</font>

1114
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:19,940
with the packet format so Babel is

1115
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:22,419
designed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented in tonight's</font>

1116
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:24,890
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest</font>

1117
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,320
implementation and in particular it does

1118
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:30,109
not have a recursive parser so it's not

1119
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,960
like an is is or you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

1120
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:35,690
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds within GL v's within tlds</font>

1121
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:40,340
until you reach the turtles all the way

1122
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:43,550
down it's what Babel does is very simple

1123
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a packet in the packet you have</font>

1124
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:50,330
a sequence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tal vez every tlv has its</font>

1125
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,630
payload and sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> gles we don't have sub</font>

1126
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:57,049
sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds ok it's not recursive</font>

1127
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:58,339
ok so here you are in your encoding as

1128
01:05:57,049 --> 01:06:00,049
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I think that there are good</font>

1129
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:02,509
reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not the incumbent</font>

1130
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we want but in your encoding you're</font>

1131
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:08,299
introducing for the first time in Babel

1132
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:11,599
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub-sub TLD now perhaps there's good</font>

1133
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:16,670
reason perhaps we do need sub sub T

1134
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">alvey's ok but my my feeling here would</font>

1135
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:22,940
be that we should not introduce a third

1136
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:24,828
level of tal vez unless we're convinced

1137
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:31,160
that we really have a good reason why we

1138
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:34,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">eat them I think we chew the changes for</font>

1139
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:39,230
my check for eh maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> only your sub jovi</font>

1140
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:44,470
is enough no I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do</font>

1141
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:47,779
want for beer would be a new AE number

1142
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:52,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok and not encoded as a subject as a</font>

1143
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:56,089
subtype new<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number I know you miss</font>

1144
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:58,939
Thatcher we use the new 84 pier and we

1145
01:06:56,089 --> 01:07:07,190
will not use a sub T of it really yeah

1146
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:11,779
good and I must occur by Lodge this

1147
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:14,359
document is not the same as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hakama</font>

1148
01:07:11,779 --> 01:07:16,130
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> I presented a yin thora meeting in</font>

1149
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:18,049
SAR meeting at the pier extension and

1150
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,630
this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> has the information</font>

1151
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:25,150
extension at a carry the different

1152
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:28,369
things in edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah your extension as</font>

1153
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:33,740
important so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if</font>

1154
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:36,740
this is we did David's<font color="#CCCCCC"> canal see Apple</font>

1155
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,508
up so I don't know much about beer but i

1156
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:43,160
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask what's the status of the</font>

1157
01:07:38,509 --> 01:07:47,059
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this we have built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1158
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:50,808
project of beer again<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh do open</font>

1159
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:55,009
daylight and we will do some work about

1160
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:57,799
here pebble extension and this document

1161
01:07:55,009 --> 01:08:01,089
means that we will transfer the body has

1162
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:04,609
the information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bevel so if this</font>

1163
01:08:01,089 --> 01:08:07,340
structure is mixed sense we will do the

1164
01:08:04,609 --> 01:08:09,290
job I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

1165
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,750
I think it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the founding</font>

1166
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:13,880
principles of the ITF is that you write

1167
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:16,939
the code first and that's how you find

1168
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,370
out if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft makes sense because</font>

1169
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:21,080
that's because sometimes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1170
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that looks perfect like for me</font>

1171
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,170
it makes sense I don't see anything

1172
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:27,830
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> about apart the points that Joy's</font>

1173
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:29,450
made that I agree with but you could

1174
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,189
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then realize that it</font>

1175
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:33,920
doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I've done that many</font>

1176
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:35,960
times before so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we were to</font>

1177
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,240
move forward with this document as a

1178
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,580
working group we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear your</font>

1179
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,740
experience deploy like implementing and

1180
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:46,370
unemployment I think that is a first

1181
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">step for us to move forward until I</font>

1182
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:53,120
understand what you are constant mmm but

1183
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:56,630
we I have discussed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with many expert</font>

1184
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,849
in female<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove all bearable wouldn't</font>

1185
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:04,330
group nothing is as good as<font color="#E5E5E5"> running code</font>

1186
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're good is the first oh</font>

1187
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:12,679
yeah atlas so we do encourage running

1188
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:16,339
code and in this working group there is

1189
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:18,940
general agreement that really get some

1190
01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:23,420
code in place to see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on as</font>

1191
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:25,370
Julia says it doesn't take a lot to do

1192
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,770
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation and they're</font>

1193
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:29,720
open source implementations out there

1194
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:33,410
where you can take what you have for

1195
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,870
your ideas and see how well they play

1196
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:41,000
out and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens when you try</font>

1197
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do something so while there are many</font>

1198
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts in different areas where in</font>

1199
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:48,439
different working groups where there

1200
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:51,019
isn't there is not such a strong

1201
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:54,200
emphasis on having an implementation

1202
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:57,740
first in this working group there is a

1203
01:09:54,200 --> 01:10:02,019
desire to have that as a good baseline

1204
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:07,849
because it's fairly straightforward and

1205
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:10,880
because it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same decades</font>

1206
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:14,060
sorry of history that some of the

1207
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,770
existing protocols do that make us know

1208
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:19,660
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend it it's just a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1209
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">know this working with right</font>

1210
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:29,050
second because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you weren't very</font>

1211
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:32,950
familiar with beer I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1212
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:35,550
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1213
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the details of the encapsulations</font>

1214
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:43,780
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> homenet does have the desire to have</font>

1215
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:45,730
multicast where your router's we're

1216
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:48,429
doing most your forwarding and software

1217
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:50,860
or if you get this get some of the beer

1218
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:52,480
forwarding pieces taped out but where we

1219
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,420
have software implementations doing some

1220
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,190
of the forwarding it's a bitmap<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

1221
01:10:55,420 --> 01:11:00,550
fundamental paradigm shift from doing

1222
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:05,259
longest prefix map prefix match to

1223
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:06,820
looking at a bitmap and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1224
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,180
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have something like</font>

1225
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:12,480
him or another multicast protocol which

1226
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:19,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of potential to</font>

1227
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:21,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplify the home environment so I would</font>

1228
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:25,720
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to read up a little bit on</font>

1229
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:28,840
beer to see because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if it were</font>

1230
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:39,190
done right and there were the interest

1231
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it has potential okay any other</font>

1232
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:47,040
comments I guess we could move on to

1233
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,040
thank you thank you

1234
01:12:01,019 --> 01:12:23,800
network way Oh alia is going to oh no

1235
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:26,980
there isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday von dreiberg who</font>

1236
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,139
said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much for babel to</font>

1237
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:33,089
remain possible with a forward only

1238
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:37,539
parser such as this followed with a link

1239
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:40,630
which can be expressed in very log I can

1240
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:44,440
no longer even raise my hand Barbara if

1241
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:46,480
you could mention mine Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Julius</font>

1242
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:53,768
you did an excellent job of channeling

1243
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:56,829
barber channeling day and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

1244
01:12:53,769 --> 01:13:00,010
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is Gabrielle not in the room is</font>

1245
01:12:56,829 --> 01:13:01,929
Gabrielle only on like me dekho well

1246
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,670
Gabrielle's doing a great job of also

1247
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:06,130
helping with the minute so I just wanted

1248
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:10,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a shout out to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1249
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:12,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go real so anyway i hastily through</font>

1250
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,589
this together in preparation for this

1251
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,360
meeting and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel so bad i haven't</font>

1252
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:18,610
put enough time in it but anyway next

1253
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:21,429
slide this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

1254
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:25,389
model that is part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter um and</font>

1255
01:13:21,429 --> 01:13:28,869
i did make some changes to the draft

1256
01:13:25,389 --> 01:13:30,880
that i submitted way back in Berlin and

1257
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:33,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">I went back and I dragged out Julius</font>

1258
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,050
email where he recommended changes and I

1259
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:36,670
tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply them and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failed</font>

1260
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:40,329
because I actually missed some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1261
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:42,460
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said but so be it these are the</font>

1262
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:44,558
changes i'm not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through them</font>

1263
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,059
because they're like really detailed but

1264
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:49,389
there's the one I missed it will be in

1265
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:50,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> revision um and here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1266
01:13:49,389 --> 01:13:52,599
there was somewhere I said I need to

1267
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:57,280
understand this better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take</font>

1268
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to the list I think it may be um it</font>

1269
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,239
may be better for it not to be done

1270
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,300
verbally but rather in typing format on

1271
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:07,808
and he were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some other things um</font>

1272
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,940
that I did and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one thing I did</font>

1273
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:12,280
want to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is the last slide</font>

1274
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:14,589
where there had been discussion back in

1275
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,830
Berlin about trying to introduce some

1276
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:20,860
statistics into the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I really</font>

1277
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:23,590
didn't have anything concrete to do with

1278
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and so if anybody does want to</font>

1279

<font color="#CCCCCC">be great any comments okay i'll just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">babble demon and drawing pretty pictures</font>

1287
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:52,840
and screen and if you have actual

1288
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:55,389
suggestions of what data they should be

1289
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,610
producing I mean producing some JSON or

1290
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:59,409
whatever once they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are speaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1291
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:01,630
babble demon should be no problem i'm

1292
01:14:59,409 --> 01:15:04,210
sure they will be willing to do it so

1293
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:07,659
like maybe an<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml format kind of thing</font>

1294
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:10,540
can we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay some JSON oh yeah yeah I</font>

1295
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I I don't care it's all the same</font>

1296
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:17,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">but yeah I could do JSON okay that would</font>

1297
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:23,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be very consistent with what</font>

1298
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:24,969
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also do in the TR 69 so</font>

1299
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,650
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if you could</font>

1300
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:29,560
provide them with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidance about</font>

1301
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:31,869
what is worth provided worth producing

1302
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I'm sure that could be that would</font>

1303
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:40,809
be helpful yeah well alia is saying you

1304
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:43,989
could do Yang and Jason yes but of

1305
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:46,780
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't do yang as well as I know</font>

1306
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:54,400
broadband forum but you know we'll see

1307
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:56,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I do hear you if we</font>

1308
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,699
have the information model I think we

1309
01:15:56,139 --> 01:16:00,429
can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to help with some of</font>

1310
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:03,219
the game exactly but if you're looking

1311
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">at playing with it in the summer where</font>

1312
01:16:03,219 --> 01:16:07,840
I'd start is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1313
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:09,519
here's the yang model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

1314
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,219
implement it with a JSON encapsulation

1315
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,869
and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be right but since ice do</font>

1316
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:16,030
actually intend to bring this into

1317
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:17,860
broadband forum for me personally it

1318
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:20,230
will make sense to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

1319
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,759
working on the broadband forum model oh

1320
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:23,888
absolutely that's why we have the

1321
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:27,870
information model in the Charter is for

1322
01:16:23,889 --> 01:16:30,510
both cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1323
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:34,440
well I guess the people feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to</font>

1324
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:35,850
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> too probably after one more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rev but</font>

1325
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,230
the personal graph we could do a call

1326
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:39,900
for adoption I mean they were sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1327
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:41,820
working on it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is I mean I don't</font>

1328
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,679
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they say there's consensus that we</font>

1329
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:49,530
should adopt it and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> flattered as a</font>

1330
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">working of document not necessarily but</font>

1331
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:57,990
if you know anything moving along

1332
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:59,640
reasonably with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the previous</font>

1333
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">version i I'm sorry I didn't read this</font>

1334
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,080
one but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was even</font>

1335
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,790
improved from there and I usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1336
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,250
you can make something working group

1337
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:09,570
document if you think it's a really good

1338
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,920
basis for the working group to start and

1339
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:13,650
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said the previous one was</font>

1340
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,390
good enough so I'm all for like making a

1341
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:20,690
call to make it a working group item I

1342
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:23,400
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just do it it here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1343
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:26,400
you also realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be where to move</font>

1344
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,170
that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the next revision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1345
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:36,889
will submit as a working group draft

1346
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:36,890
through you yay it would look good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1347
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:51,570
so that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda there is</font>

1348
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:55,849
anything else anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants doing up</font>

1349
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:58,799
that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good time it's not I</font>

1350
01:17:55,850 --> 01:18:00,480
guess we will adjourn until<font color="#E5E5E5"> fog I see</font>

1351
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:07,800
you on the mailing list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> implied</font>

1352
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:11,969
thank you very much you can't if I could

1353
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:14,310
buy one young<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue sheet should come</font>

1354
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:17,070
back to the head table one way or<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1355
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:19,350
and anybody who did not yes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

1356
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:22,580
bring them up for whatever anybody who

1357
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:22,580
didn't sign should do so

1358
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:03,510
