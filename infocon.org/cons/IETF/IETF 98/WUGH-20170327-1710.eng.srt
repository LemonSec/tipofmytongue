23
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for clarifying questions after that but</font>

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,250
even though that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

25
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightning rod we would rather not block</font>

26
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,080
down on that because will immediately go

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,200
into how do youhow working groups use

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,650
github that'll be Martin Thompson and

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,570
then we will definitely have time to

30
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,760
talk no one has given me some any

31
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,350
presentations on issue so it'll mostly

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,630
be what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally call a mic</font>

33
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,220
line and we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of here at ten</font>

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,980
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> after six and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have much</font>

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,550
more to talk about afterwards um but

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is where we're going so um this</font>

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">Voth is in the general area um because</font>

38
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of things so thank you you</font>

39
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,300
re Thank You Alyssa um be very clear

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,730
here this is not a working group forming

41
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,860
bought this is a hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time deal</font>

42
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,660
where when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have more questions and</font>

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas afterwards you'll talk to each</font>

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,770
other we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a mailing list which is at</font>

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:25,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of this slide and but there</font>

46
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,080
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no intention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form a working group</font>

47
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,930
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are discussing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents that are</font>

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,000
already out there um so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

49
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,760
more discussion of them but there's no

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
idea to have a working group out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,579
so why we're doing this is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have many people have said oh I've</font>

53
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,700
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this or we're using github a</font>

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,400
little bit in our group or I want to

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:51,170
know more and things like that um and uh

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,060
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the idea is to is to socialize</font>

57
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,500
it I'm this is sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> school</font>

58
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,239
kind of off where we're actually

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,420
supposed to just sort of say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh your</font>

60
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,400
internet i'm interested in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font>

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,309
here's the obligatory humorous slide

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,780
because people have been asking me you

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,640
know how do you pronounce that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,070
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are valid pronunciations in</font>

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">english and capitalization counts</font>

66
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,019
somebody actually asked me about what

67
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,130
gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is so which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is perfectly</font>

68
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,530
reasonable cuz they didn't know what get

69
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,040
was someone actually earlier asked me

70
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,390
about why should they join linkedin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,690
it's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> capitalization</font>

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:32,030
counts so I will uh I will this is the

73
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,770
next hopefully 10 minutes

74
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,039
is going to be a whole bunch of slides

75
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,900
being blown at you these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our all of</font>

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups that when I put on</font>

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mailing list I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked you know what</font>

78
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,790
are you doing what's your level and such

79
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,030
like that these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones who</font>

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,610
responded so it's an incomplete list on

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is not for you to write</font>

82
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,990
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the notes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I'm saying</font>

83
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,820
but to when you see if you're interested

84
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">in using github in your working group</font>

85
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,500
and you see a working group that either

86
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,390
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or that you know about make a</font>

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,520
note of that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you will know those</font>

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,169
people and such like that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is</font>

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">also being discussed on the mailing list</font>

90
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,430
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way for you to know who's</font>

91
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,730
doing what and for whom it's not working

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,920
necessarily um github is a tool there

93
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,780
are other tools out there and so some of

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,310
these some of these slides in the roll

95
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,309
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> will talk about how they're doing</font>

96
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,660
that and why um but so again just look

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,550
at these are the highlights and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

98
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,950
zip through because<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what's much</font>

99
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,570
more important in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this discussion is the</font>

100
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,479
next two presentations plus the

101
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:36,020
discussion at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end so in alphabetical</font>

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,240
order um Acme uses it they oh I'm sorry

103
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,130
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of here's another acronym for you</font>

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,830
folks it I for I meant to spell it out

105
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,270
earlier is PRS pull requests if you're

106
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with github this is a</font>

107
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,359
github specific feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> um acne uses</font>

108
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,280
pull requests to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

109
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">within the document authors that is they</font>

110
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,159
use pull requests the document authors

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,550
use pull requests to track among

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,590
themselves what they are doing and why

113
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,760
they try to track all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues on the</font>

114
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,880
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course the</font>

115
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,920
discussion is on the list I'm anima uses

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,050
it for some things and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,330
a simple you know repository depository

118
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,860
site kind of thing geo Jason um part of

119
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,539
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they used this is the</font>

120
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,550
community was using github before they

121
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,410
came to the IETF which is a good reason

122
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,540
to use a tool if you already know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

123
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,640
use a power tool that's that's a good

124
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,630
reason to use that power tool and not to

125
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,610
go back to hammers um the HR pc has all

126
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,680
of their documents including the

127
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,710
documents like for meetings and such on

128
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,060
github they noted<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> repos</font>

129
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,099
actually owned by one of the co-chairs

130
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,380
this is a funny question that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

131
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,240
to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you create a github repo</font>

132
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,040
or a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group who owns it who</font>

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,200
doesn't own it who gets to change things

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and such like that so they noted that</font>

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,539
the repos owned by one of the co-chairs

136
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,280
um and they also notice noted that

137
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no single place where issues are</font>

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">being tracked that of course sucks but</font>

139
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,470
it's also common even in groups that

140
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:09,770
don't use github HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> biss the poster</font>

141
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">child um so all working group and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

142
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and we will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next two</font>

143
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,220
presentations are from people heavily

144
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,219
active and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree on on its</font>

145
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,890
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTP pissed but all the working</font>

146
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,950
group drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in a single github repo</font>

147
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,120
all issues are tracked their on they

148
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,979
also have the working group homepage

149
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,960
there so when you when you go to working

150
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">from home page you're actually end up on</font>

151
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,789
github you can tell they really really

152
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,890
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um the materials in the agenda</font>

153
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff are also on get up so they pretty</font>

154
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,180
much are using this as the home place

155
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,159
for everything and they have for quite a

156
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,380
while and for those of you not familiar

157
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,990
with HTTP bisque they just pushed out

158
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,850
maybe a year ago a large raft of

159
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,850
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all had a lot of</font>

160
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,710
interconnections and they use github

161
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:59,300
also to track the interconnections um so

162
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,570
there's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of IOT groups um</font>

163
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,270
that uses use github for their documents

164
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,849
um and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that's common</font>

165
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,250
here with them is that because a lot of

166
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iot groups interact with groups</font>

167
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,380
outside the IETF it turns out that

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,810
having all of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff or having a</font>

169
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,219
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their stuff on github actually</font>

170
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,080
makes it excessive more easily

171
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,820
accessible to people who are outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

172
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,800
IETF who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our mailing</font>

173
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and such like that and so the open</font>

174
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,600
connectivity foundation ocf<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to</font>

175
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,750
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that's that's a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

176
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,300
note and music are using it a little bit

177
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,309
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group isn't quick</font>

178
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,169
everything happens on github because

179
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:43,669
quick as part of HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> biz nope I didn't</font>

180
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:45,020
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah yeah</font>

181
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,980
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah so that was the second</font>

182
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,240
humor slide but um and a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

183
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,370
aren't on github they say they are

184
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving to github so again very very</font>

185
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,059
active use for quick RTC web they said

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,519
yeah most the docs are and github

187
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:05,179
TLS specifically said some but not all

188
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents are there on TLS 1.3</font>

189
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,049
something near and dear to many people's

190
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:11,478
hearts um they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the github</font>

191
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,089
issue tracker and pull requests

192
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:16,579
extensively meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you say I</font>

193
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,589
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this text they really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

194
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a pull request in github</font>

195
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,259
and to track things that way and the TLS

196
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,749
working group also has a couple of other

197
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:29,539
drafts and you know not so much that

198
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:32,179
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using github on that trans has</font>

199
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:34,549
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> one one draft on it I mean</font>

200
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,608
humorously here they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually track the</font>

201
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,919
issues with track which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the IETF</font>

202
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:41,659
sponsored tracking that only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

203
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,269
number of working groups still use but

204
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:49,129
they're using github for the document

205
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:50,929
itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a split use um web push</font>

206
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,819
sort of normal some of the drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

207
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:55,819
issues are in github discussion on the

208
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:57,589
mailing list okay so that was it for the

209
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:01,608
roll call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that under</font>

210
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:04,009
10 minutes um so again the idea there is

211
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:05,749
if you saw a working group you are

212
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:07,279
interested in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might have more</font>

213
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:13,029
information they might have experienced

214
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,949
go find them um and let's move forwards

215
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,209
I'm sorry oh yeah there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably other</font>

216
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,069
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said at the beginning there were</font>

217
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:22,758
ones who just didn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know say</font>

218
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:23,868
anything but and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those will some</font>

219
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the ones who didn't say anything will</font>

220
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:28,749
also have interesting side notes so

221
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:31,249
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to you know collect a</font>

222
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:33,229
completely composite list here but we

223
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,389
want this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful for all of you so</font>

224
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:37,159
are you running<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mic okay quickly</font>

225
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alex have a nice it from you so i just</font>

226
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to mention the icy energy the</font>

227
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,939
research group also using github for

228
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:45,349
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dresses okay so yeah so</font>

229
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:50,089
that's another research group they're

230
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:51,319
using so let's move on to you know how

231
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,169
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups are allowed to use</font>

232
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:58,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party services um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i pulled this</font>

233
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:59,869
pretty much directly out of the abstract

234
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that mark could take is time to get</font>

235
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:05,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to the mic and now i will switch to</font>

236
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,608
mark slides please collect your printed

237
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:08,869
out internet-drafts in an ietf journals

238
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:10,930
and put them in a pile and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them on</font>

239
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:18,590
fire

240
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:25,670
please oh wait sorry that's that's the

241
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:28,570
wrong am sorry thank you mine are not

242
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,010
nearly as well designed as Martin's

243
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:35,960
that's right because you don't know yeah

244
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:39,170
okay go it go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we've</font>

245
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,240
been using github in HTTP uh the working

246
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,439
group for for quite some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

247
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,600
were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first or at least one of the</font>

248
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,340
first to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> github and certainly one of</font>

249
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,030
the first to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so aggressively I</font>

250
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,470
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have known that being in this</font>

251
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:57,040
room it's cold and people want you close

252
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:59,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic do you want me to like okay</font>

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,719
you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to stand on my head I'm</font>

254
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say now um so in in in the</font>

255
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,380
process of doing that and then

256
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,810
replicating you know that product that

257
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,490
that tool set for the quick working

258
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,349
group which which will just<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

259
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,640
more recently and a couple of other

260
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,770
working groups that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been working in</font>

261
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,770
the one thing that I've noticed is that

262
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,780
you know we we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

263
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,030
regularly and say well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

264
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,680
way we've done it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and are you</font>

265
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you can do that or I want to do it</font>

266
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,579
this way and that's that's a very

267
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,370
reasonable response when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first started</font>

268
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,630
using it for HTTP i went to my area

269
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,630
director who<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think at the time was</font>

270
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">mary and said is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we do this</font>

271
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,060
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about it we talked</font>

272
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,520
through it a little bit and he said yes

273
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,069
sure and that was great so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a</font>

274
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,600
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of air cover but you know</font>

275
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,460
that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an agreement between me</font>

276
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,860
and him and we talked to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

277
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,210
group about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it seems to me that it</font>

278
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,130
would be nice to have a more structured

279
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,740
approach to what you can and cannot do

280
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,150
when using these third-party tools

281
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,310
because this session really isn't just

282
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,020
about github to me even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who</font>

283
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,060
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just using github often are using</font>

284
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,949
things like CI systems and that's

285
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,189
another third-party tool it has its own

286
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,710
set of considerations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to my think</font>

287
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide let's go to the next line so</font>

288
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,520
I thinking you know what one thing we

289
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,130
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about in all of this</font>

290
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,140
is what are the foundational principles

291
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,499
that we think about when we use a third

292
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,809
party

293
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:28,369
tool like github<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use tools and</font>

294
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,659
services kind of interchangeably here

295
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:33,349
because we don't really have a

296
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:35,599
terminology for this yet um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

297
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:38,059
know that's good for the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

298
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:39,469
new to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group or who want to</font>

299
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,539
engage casually and they're used to

300
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:43,369
engaging in other mechanisms in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF</font>

301
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,439
in that they'll have more assurance that

302
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:47,479
this working group is operating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

303
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,699
that they can easily understand that

304
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:52,189
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using tools in a way that is you</font>

305
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,628
know equitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also it's good for</font>

306
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:56,689
the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group who wants to use these</font>

307
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,159
tools because you know you need some

308
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,478
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of air cover you need some sort</font>

309
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,579
of guidance that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this in a</font>

310
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:03,829
way that's a reasonable for the IETF if

311
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,809
you mess this up it is it can be very

312
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,358
bad if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use a tool in an appropriate</font>

313
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,069
way then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

314
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:13,099
their disadvantage of the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

315
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:15,019
can break down the entire process and

316
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:16,909
the guarantees we have being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

317
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,619
standards body so so having some rigor

318
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:21,859
around this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be good next</font>

319
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:24,529
slide um I did not try to address

320
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:26,569
specific tools or practices or give

321
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:28,429
general advice in this draft because

322
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:30,738
really documenting those principles is

323
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:31,848
all I wanted to do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once we</font>

324
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,319
figure out what they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

325
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:35,629
relatively long lived and we can put

326
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:37,219
them in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp or a comparable document</font>

327
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,839
and let them sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there whereas the</font>

328
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,729
advice about<font color="#E5E5E5"> using github in particular</font>

329
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,069
is going to evolve pretty continuously

330
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:44,749
for a long period of time and it may be

331
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:46,459
that an RFC is the best up but for that

332
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:49,069
it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that a wiki is the best at but</font>

333
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:52,069
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later so</font>

334
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:53,899
next slide please these are the ones

335
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:56,529
that the draft talks about and in the

336
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:59,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">vest ITF tradition i'm not going to</font>

337
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,129
regurgitate the draft to you if you're

338
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,679
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this you can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and read</font>

339
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,389
the draft it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very long but it's</font>

340
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,978
just a list of high-level principles of

341
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:08,989
the things we look for when we want to

342
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:11,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party tool to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

343
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:14,899
we're using an appropriate way and

344
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:16,159
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all I had uh I can talk</font>

345
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,399
through these a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of folks want</font>

346
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,869
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the proposal that I made no</font>

347
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,209
no Paul said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a working</font>

348
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,649
group forming<font color="#CCCCCC"> boff I think probably to</font>

349
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,748
do something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we would need</font>

350
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">some instrument that was appropriate to</font>

351
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,739
come to consensus on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

352
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:33,169
principles are but I would did want to

353
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:35,209
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in front of people any questions</font>

354
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,699
especially clarifying questions now

355
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,979
bigger questions for later but

356
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:47,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">clairol in question is she okay we still</font>

357
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:49,519
have certainly some time yeah I 30 volts

358
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:53,029
um you know one of the things is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

359
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what how do you define working</font>

360
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,369
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> use is something you know if for</font>

361
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">example like you know there-there's for</font>

362
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,290
the DC working group we do use github

363
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,149
but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it in a</font>

364
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,639
broad working group context we use it

365
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,009
more for the two co-chairs to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

366
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">work together and have like a single</font>

367
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:15,559
place to put information and things like

368
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,629
that um you know and we have used it for

369
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,449
like a few documents where there was a

370
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:23,779
group of authors that you know needed

371
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:25,309
stuff so you know and we didn't really

372
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about oh this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a big</font>

373
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:31,100
issue because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we put these are</font>

374
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:33,498
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that were we're using um so</font>

375
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,160
you know how do you define a working

376
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:38,959
groups use versus sort of this not

377
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,339
private use or you include<font color="#CCCCCC"> that private</font>

378
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,628
use in this right I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

379
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,850
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask that two things come to</font>

380
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,259
mind one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a participant you</font>

381
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,149
know would reasonably think that they

382
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,559
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that tool to</font>

383
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,169
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the working group that's</font>

384
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,939
using that tool and the other is if you

385
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,919
form a hard dependency on the tool where

386
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,719
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have significant investment</font>

387
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,699
in that tool and if it gets taken away

388
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,769
one day then you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem as a</font>

389
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,449
working group but that probably means

390
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,888
you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tool to because we</font>

391
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,350
make it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we it's publicly</font>

392
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:11,629
readable it's just the people that can

393
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">make changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our control because these</font>

394
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,380
are all you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are sort of IETF</font>

395
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,688
related work products and things like

396
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and to be clear these these</font>

397
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,559
lists this list here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

398
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,240
a particularly high bar I can't imagine

399
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,740
that anybody who's curling using github

400
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:30,559
is can have a significant problem with

401
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,970
any of these ok Eric fine can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

402
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,019
give a brief definition of what you mean

403
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">by recoverability I mean that if for</font>

404
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:40,909
example using github uh if they were to

405
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,459
plow into the ground tomorrow and lose

406
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:45,200
all their data or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> now get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sued in</font>

407
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,980
submission that you're working groups

408
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,539
work is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not lost right okay thanks or if</font>

409
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,620
they started charging 40 million dollars

410
00:17:50,539 --> 00:18:02,270
per user or something

411
00:17:51,620 --> 00:18:04,909
you know Kyle rose um not just work but

412
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,830
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's not just not just the</font>

413
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:12,640
output but overall the discussion in the

414
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,639
pull requests and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot yes thank you</font>

415
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:33,678
great thanks thanks Martin swap here

416
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:38,209
creative slides they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures so</font>

417
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:44,900
um part of the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this draft was</font>

418
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:46,370
to act as a target so hence the slide so

419
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking about the larger</font>

420
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,928
context we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a little bit about</font>

421
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,520
other tools but obviously at this point

422
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary tool that we're talking</font>

423
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,530

424
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,570
specifics in a little more detail here

425
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,770
and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to talk about</font>

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the drafter a little while because I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think though Paul did a great job of the</font>

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduction here I want to sort of talk</font>

429
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:11,960
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the philosophy that sort</font>

of goes behind this so next place mark

431
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,370
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

432
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,550
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that actually used</font>

433
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,439
github in the sense that you had to in

434
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,870
order to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any meaningful</font>

435
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,600
way you had to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

436
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that was new we were</font>

437
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,350
tracking issues there but we weren't

438
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,120
actually doing any discussion but it

439
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,189
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people had to visit get home</font>

440
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,320
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state of the working group</font>

441
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was that was really sort of the</font>

442
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,620
first time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and as an</font>

443
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,570
editor on on those specs I used github

444
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,239
pretty heavily and we saw a lot of

445
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,149
contributions there that was successful

446
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i'm a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> followed and when we have a</font>

447
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,980
long roll call already you probably only

448
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,660
covered like a quarter of the working

449
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:01,790
groups in that I don't think of all the

450
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:04,730
people here would indicate that there's

451
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,330
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than the mere eight or</font>

452
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten</font>

453
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:12,620
that you actually had<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so next so</font>

454
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,409
the question about what it is that we do

455
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,870
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we do it is kind of</font>

456
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:21,380
important we talk a lot about the what

457
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,239
we do and why we do it but the how is is

458
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,500
kind of critical and move I think we

459
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some reason we're good processes</font>

460
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,940
for deciding what work that we do when

461
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,590
forming working groups and how we select

462
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,400
chairs and editors and all those sorts

463
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,500
of other things that's pretty well

464
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,210
understood now but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part the next</font>

465
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,100
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can we can talk</font>

466
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:45,620
about improving the process overall next

467
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:49,129
so the underlying principle here that

468
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,100
we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is we that I'm looking</font>

469
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">for is I would like to like us to start</font>

470
00:20:52,100 --> 00:21:00,679
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC's the way we build software</font>

471
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:04,159
and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in some of the</font>

472
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,990
same terms not not necessarily all at

473
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,190
the same terms we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

474
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up all of the baggage that we</font>

475
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:15,680
had there but start to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

476
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:18,110
the same sort of terms so next and I

477
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,900
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the target that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

478
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:24,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">for here as an organization is we want</font>

479
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-quality open source software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

480
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,970
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's that we develop our</font>

481
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,640
essentially as open as they possibly

482
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:36,140
could be and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet a</font>

483
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,790
certain bar of quality next so does it

484
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:43,340
actually mean um yeah that we don't

485
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,080
necessarily we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not we're not looking</font>

486
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:49,730
for ISO 9000 certification here or

487
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything like that we also don't build</font>

488
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,130
software that meets it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

489
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">right um my trainees got a date on that</font>

490
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,190
but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and but some of the</font>

491
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,990
principles they're actually do apply in

492
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,910
terms of do you have a reproducible

493
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,380
process do you actually understand what

494
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,210
process you use to produce the output

495
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,950
that you have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those sorts of</font>

496
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,790
questions come in next so to some extent

497
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,020
a lot of this relies on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree of</font>

498
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,250
quality assurance that we have and we

499
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,150
have a bunch of

500
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,970
processes in in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that allow us</font>

501
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,680
to control the quality of the output

502
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have cross area</font>

503
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,290
review teams directorates and and the

504
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:38,030
likes we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tenets to sort of do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

505
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:41,720
at low level basic checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherd's</font>

506
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,760
automation but we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some</font>

507
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,320
working groups are taking this a little

508
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,690
further than this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font>

509
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the working groups that are producing</font>

510
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,480
yang models are actually pretty far I

511
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,810
had a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this they actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

512
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,270
tools that take the the schema documents

513
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,040
they have and turn them into the

514
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">textures in the documents they have</font>

515
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,600
automated validation for those things

516
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,490
and pretty good tool chain around those

517
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,810
sorts of things and I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of previous</font>

518
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,920
hackathons and some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive</font>

519
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:14,060
work in that area so um listen there's

520
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,380
some interesting things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

521
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">potentially be doing in that service</font>

522
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:23,990
packs next um so one of the principles

523
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm particularly fond of is this is</font>

524
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the this notion that you continuously</font>

525
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,660
about validate what it is that you've

526
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:38,450
produced and and this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

527
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,830
I'd like to to get in the process some

528
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,300
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are using some of</font>

529
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,629
the tools that are available for github

530
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,480
are actually now taking advantage of the

531
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,540
fact that the document produces valid

532
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,410
text every commit that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

533
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,820
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on we can enable that if</font>

534
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are generating pull requests</font>

535
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,530
against the quick spec you will actually

536
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,510
see a little red mark down the bottom if

537
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,760
you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong and it's not</font>

538
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,100
able to produce a valid document out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

539
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,970
the the changes that you've made and so

540
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,939
that's that's valuable that keeps the

541
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,500
process nice and smooth is essentially

542
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,820
grease on the wheel but it's a pretty

543
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,350
low bar to me there are specifications

544
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,250
in this organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

545
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:28,159
include code not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great deal but some</font>

546
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,230
of them a lot it would be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that</font>

547
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,870
code actually compiled when we ship it

548
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,669
and ensuring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is continues to</font>

549
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,489
remain true is something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

550
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,640
interesting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the fact that the</font>

551
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:48,040
code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct is probably something</font>

552
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will be hard to do but the tests</font>

553
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't actually need to sit in the RFC</font>

554
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,330
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might need to exist is my</font>

555
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,879
suggestion there and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

556
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,740
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often run into particularly in some</font>

557
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,980
of the more complex documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

558
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,500
produce lengthy examples I'm thinking in

559
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,320
particular here sip<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour or some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

560
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,790
male examples or those documents that

have a large amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML in them for</font>

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance it's really nice if the ex the</font>

correct based on the definitions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

565
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,969
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are using</font>

566
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,918
schema language languages to express

567
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,140
what it is that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing can take</font>

568
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,580
advantage of automatic validation and

569
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the underlying principle here is keep it</font>

short make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you learn about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing quickly next so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

572
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:45,730
very crude diagram showing how it is

573
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,940
that we produce a document at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font>

574
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:54,990
our major forms of feedback into this

575
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:57,429
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two big orange lines</font>

576
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,559
those happen after we publish revisions

577
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:05,250
to drafts and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen at meetings</font>

578
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:07,540
and it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen that next slide</font>

579
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:15,250
that the feedback cycle is about this

580
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:19,210
long and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are here now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right welcome</font>

581
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,650
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for participating we thank you</font>

582
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,919
for joining us once<font color="#E5E5E5"> every four months</font>

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:27,190
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this oh that's kind of bad our next</font>

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide the real validation we get for</font>

585
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

586
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,200
implement and deploy them turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

587
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,140
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen anywhere near often</font>

588
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,820
enough one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons i think that</font>

589
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,740
the HTTP to work was successful was two

590
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,678
things one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we reduced the</font>

591
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,060
four-month loop to effectively a

592
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,120
two-month loop

593
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,929
and the other was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did this</font>

594
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement and deploy thing was it the</font>

595
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:58,680
third meeting that we had twitter com

596
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,679
running it or something it was crazy

597
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,020
yeah so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll repeat what Mark said we</font>

598
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,590
were childhood at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

599
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:18,790
year the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation draft went out</font>

600
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:21,340
in June and it was deployed in august 10

601
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:24,700
implementations at that time not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

602
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,379
deployments but yeah and we're sitting

603
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">in it at an interim discussing some</font>

604
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,160
changes and someone said oh yeah I'll

605
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,700
have that on twitter com tomorrow

606
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:40,900
morning and we're like okay maybe slow

607
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:42,970
down to next<font color="#E5E5E5"> line so part of the problem</font>

608
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,280
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we have humans in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a loop in</font>

609
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to turn a specification into code</font>

610
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,370
you need someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

611
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:54,610
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not usually a trivial task</font>

612
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,139
the hackathon is a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvement in</font>

613
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,409
this regard we're actually getting some

614
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good feedback on this on</font>

615
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:05,620
processes and development net<font color="#CCCCCC"> VC neatly</font>

616
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,830
avoid this problem by making the code

617
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:11,530
the specification and opus did this the

618
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:17,350
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I wouldn't recommend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

619
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:20,020
everyone so to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the crux of</font>

620
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,550
the issue fast early feedback is

621
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,350
something that I'm looking for in and

622
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,090
that's patching those early phases so

623
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,750
that we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback cycle</font>

624
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:32,580
happening a lot quicker and that is when

625
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">people discuss particular issues having</font>

626
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,899
text to go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discussion is often</font>

627
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,750
extremely valuable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've found that</font>

628
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,340
those discussions in working groups

629
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,530
where there's a pull request associated

630
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,389
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and text associated with them</font>

631
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:50,590
tend to be a lot more efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

632
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:53,140
effective and even if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

633
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,199
that simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> having access to the editors</font>

634
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,670
copy of a document that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been updated</font>

635
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,500
with whatever the editor is currently

636
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:03,100
managed to do

637
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,630
is a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage it means that those</font>

638
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,350
people working in the working group who

639
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,240
were actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved are tracking the</font>

640
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,030
discussion and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

641
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,300
document is as close to possible as is

642
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,670
possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current state that in</font>

643
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,980
everyone's heads and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

644
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:25,750
dealing with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-month-old document</font>

645
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:28,330
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflect where everyone's</font>

646
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:35,710
minds<font color="#CCCCCC"> have have gone in intervening</font>

647
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:39,070
space next on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely separate</font>

648
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:42,010
topic it also turns out that venues like

649
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,620
github have other people sitting there

650
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,150
already people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who never come to one of</font>

651
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">these meetings or would not be inclined</font>

652
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to but nonetheless drive on by and send</font>

653
00:29:50,950 --> 00:30:01,990
you a poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

654
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:07,030
surprisingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it saved me a lot of</font>

655
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:08,770
typos<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much and what's</font>

656
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,270
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really easy to handle these</font>

657
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,190
contributions because they come in the

658
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,320
form of all requests and all you need to

659
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:20,140
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is check that it's saying and press a</font>

660
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:29,200
button and that is quite a powerful

661
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:30,700
thing so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was how does that</font>

662
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:40,510
work with the blue sheets I'm not sure

663
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:47,110
how this also so you're concerned about

664
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:49,840
ownership yeah um so we now know well

665
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,310
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only have a couple more</font>

666
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,020
slides and then we do have plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

667
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:57,990
time so maybe we can talk we can take

668
00:30:53,020 --> 00:31:01,260
this up after<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that next place oh</font>

669
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,640
um one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that has been</font>

670
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,080
usually useful we found particularly

671
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,750
when we've come to the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

672
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,360
process and we get start to get wider

673
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,679
review from people new people start

674
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,820
coming into working groups implementing

675
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,889
these things

676
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,009
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions and they say why is</font>

677
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:21,250
it like this and we can we now have the

678
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:24,539
tools available to us to go back find

679
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,830
the issues that we were using identify

680
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:30,190
the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was happening it's a</font>

681
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:32,620
lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that with with an issue</font>

682
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracker rather than trying to search</font>

683
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,189
through mail archives and you can

684
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,539
actually see why you made that

685
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,880
particular change and who made that

686
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:43,629
change and that's that's a pretty

687
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">powerful thing as I said threading in</font>

688
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:51,580
context is kind of important and I find

689
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a discussion in context has</font>

690
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,769
been quite useful and quick so we

691
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,809
decided at some point to move from the

692
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:01,679
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the issues were merely being</font>

693
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:04,210
tracked in github to actually allowing

694
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,740
substantive discussion on github and

695
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,029
that's been pretty pretty valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

696
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:15,639
and as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor changes are much</font>

697
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:17,289
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you avoid typos</font>

698
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,508
because when you make a pull request

699
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:22,929
people comment on and say look you've

700
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:26,590
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typo there and you fix it or if</font>

701
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:29,409
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typo escapes that that phase you get</font>

702
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,360
a pull request and most of the

703
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">contributions from drive-bys have been</font>

704
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,758
simply clarifications fixing grammar

705
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:41,889
realigning the the stupid ascii art that

706
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,399
we've been forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to draw those sorts of</font>

707
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:47,379
things and so it's not the problem that

708
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:52,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">Paul was concerned about that's not</font>

709
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:54,039
being an issue thus far but it's

710
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:57,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly one worth discussing I think</font>

711
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,720
that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have oh yeah I'm supposed</font>

712
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to remind people of what's actually in</font>

713
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,019
the draft next<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically says well</font>

714
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:07,269
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how to decide to use it what</font>

715
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:09,340
to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it says some of the same</font>

716
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:11,710
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mark strife does although I</font>

717
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,590
think marks draft sort of covers it more

718
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:19,210
cleanly particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the principles</font>

719
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:21,039
that is outlined it does have some more

720
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:25,389
specific advice on how to how to manage

721
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,350
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some general blathering</font>

722
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,820
about very

723
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,510
thinks it was never intended to be

724
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">published as the the stocks at the front</font>

725
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,320
indicated it was meant as a target where

726
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,940
we were someone was threatening to have

727
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">a working Boff and feel like I was going</font>

728
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,720
to say wreck and ruin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there was a</font>

729
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,320
threat of having a buff with with no

730
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,640
documents oil no substantial targets for

731
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,879
discussion and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that that was</font>

732
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,250
just not on so I put this together mmm

733
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,710
thanks to a layer for actually like

734
00:33:54,250 --> 00:34:01,780
fixing it because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dire state</font>

735
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:06,669
before she fixed most of that so it was

736
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:09,399
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad let's be frank so that's all</font>

737
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:11,619
I'll blathering in there and it also has

738
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,819
one other thing github is not available

739
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:20,980
over ipv6 so the community can shed it

740
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:23,169
here so actually Martin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark one</font>

741
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,730
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people saying things to me</font>

742
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:26,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you running up you shine why don't</font>

743
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:41,139
you guys just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand in the pink box</font>

744
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:45,040
together and he'll answer you're so cute

745
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:46,389
together in the box so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

746
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,560
resident and by the way just just as a

747
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,240
point we have about 15 or 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes um</font>

748
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,668
just and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume we're going to fill it</font>

749
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,879
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bike line um do pay attention</font>

750
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:59,230
to we do have a mailing list um I'm sure

751
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,119
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to generate stuff for the</font>

752
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,630
mailing list but feel free to Mike line

753
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,760
for about 15 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 minutes mark thanks</font>

754
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,960
so this is Pete Resnick I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i'm</font>

755
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,940
not going to say anything you'll

756
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,200
disagree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly here but it</font>

757
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,840
struck me that what Martin you described

758
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,850
as the way that the process is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

759
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,609
gotten much better due to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of github</font>

760
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,900
is exactly the way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process was when</font>

761
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:28,029
I started but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was because back then</font>

762
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">mail and usenet were the ways that we</font>

763
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,430
collaborated on stuff and so the switch

764
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:35,680
to github is simply we're starting to

765
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,319
use the ways that engineers are

766
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,060
collaborating on stuff again and the

767
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,150
only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

768
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">a then as sort of a direction is let's</font>

769
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">not go through this process again where</font>

770
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,740
we get stuck on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool because all of us</font>

771
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,500
in this community love that tool and

772
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,600
then when new people start coming to the

773
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,830
community look at us ago using that

774
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,259
stupid tool um some sort of agility with

775
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,640
our about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> our use of different</font>

776
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,730
tools different ways of working together

777
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,620
so but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> continued to plug into at</font>

778
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,200
the end of the day we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

779
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,940
stable that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to and say</font>

780
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,140
that's what we mean for now as the

781
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,610
standard and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way just Pete even</font>

782
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,500
though you have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> here forever you</font>

783
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,180
didn't say your name and we do it okay

784
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,870
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we do have a</font>

785
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:30,850
minute taker so yes please sorry I

786
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:33,549
missed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Micah bishop so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say the</font>

787
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:35,830
HGP working group being my first working

788
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,240
group coming into I kind of saw this

789
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,490
from the beginning and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't know the</font>

790
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">old process but I wasn't familiar with</font>

791
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,970
github either so it has been

792
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,470
surprisingly good to collaborate there

793
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:51,640
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to learn get in the</font>

794
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:53,410
process the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been most</font>

795
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,470
frustrating to me particularly now that

796
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,180
I'm a doc headed or in quick is we don't

797
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have an agreed way to reach</font>

798
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,290
consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we and we continue to</font>

799
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this I ATF process that consensus</font>

800
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,759
is on the mailing list consensus is not

801
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:12,400
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> meetings consensus is not on github</font>

802
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,530
and so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a hundred</font>

803
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">ish resolved issues and quick and we</font>

804
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:22,440
have formal consensus on one so with my

805
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,149
quick working group chair hat on

806
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,900
co-chair Lars is out to see about to say

807
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:33,070
we don't even have it on that one we we

808
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">just we just started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh as you know I</font>

809
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:38,170
put out a call for consensus about a

810
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:41,380
week ago on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> were there to me</font>

811
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,970
way too many issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have been</font>

812
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,520
feeling our way through this process and

813
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,899
i put a link on to the jabber which is

814
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,290
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate here at</font>

815
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,720
the IDF another two memorials business

816
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,500
to our contributing document which is a

817
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,120
we

818
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,950
we started this in HTTP working group

819
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,480
where github allows you to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file</font>

820
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,609
on the rep<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that is automatically</font>

821
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,900
shown to people or<font color="#CCCCCC"> linked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to people when</font>

822
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,970
they create an issue or do certain

823
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,490
things on the repo and this is the terms

824
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,290
of contribution and you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evolved</font>

825
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,669
that over time to be you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

826
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,950
how you participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this working</font>

827
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,380
group this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we get to consensus in</font>

828
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,700
this working group and if folks are on

829
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,890
the jabber channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd I'd encourage you</font>

830
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,390
to read that because that reflects how

831
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,200
we're working right now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

832
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,700
getting to that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your</font>

833
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,930
feedback there is is good that makes me

834
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,230
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about the state we</font>

835
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:32,080
charted quick in than anything else well

836
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:34,330
I've really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see in whatever</font>

837
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts wound up being produced here if</font>

838
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,910
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp or whatever is consensus</font>

839
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:45,100
still determined on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list and</font>

840
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:47,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">if so what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

841
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say sorry all right are you happy</font>

842
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:53,140
with the way we've currently documented

843
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:55,419
it for quick that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best we've got</font>

844
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now yeah the thing that frustrates</font>

845
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,090
me with quick is I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we've</font>

846
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,379
gotten into a process I mean admittedly

847
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:07,720
only and wrap 02 of we have all the

848
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:12,460
proposed resolutions in this draft speak

849
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,319
now or forever hold your peace it's

850
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,760
never like that it's always if we get

851
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,290
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and that has a broad</font>

852
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,920
definition you can reopen an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted</font>

853
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hardy I chair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rgc web and acne both of</font>

854
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,320
which use github in very different ways

855
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:34,600
and one of the things i'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point</font>

856
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:38,050
out is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think its point about</font>

857
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,930
don't get caught in a tool for all time

858
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,620
needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended slightly to</font>

859
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:45,160
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use different</font>

860
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:49,120
tools not just for different working

861
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,129
groups but for different life cycle

862
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,710
points in a working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll point</font>

863
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,360
out that an HTTP nobody suggested going

864
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,160
to github while we were still in the

865
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,600
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these three candidate drafts</font>

866
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">stage right the leader you are in the</font>

867
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,910
process the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate the github</font>

868
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,500
style of

869
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:12,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have the structure and we're</font>

870
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">making contributions to it etc the more</font>

871
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,509
natural that feels at least to me and if

872
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,720
you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> still at the stage where</font>

873
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:22,450
somebody may need to say nope this whole

874
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,450
approach is wrong they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

875
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,160
do that as a as a giant PR emptying and

876
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,589
replacing a document they have to do it

877
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,660
as a new document and so there's a yeah

878
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:33,660
it's been done Richard points out to me

879
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,829
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the enzyme ace so Ted Oh</font>

880
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,410
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that the w3c does this on</font>

881
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:44,710
occasion we therefore my chicken draft

882
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:48,009
and on yes I was it was excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

883
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:51,190
the point is let's not either get stuck

884
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">on using this particular tool or assume</font>

885
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,240
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the same tool through the</font>

886
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,890
life cycle of a working group but as it

887
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,779
may very well be that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

888
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,210
useful tool for authors in the early

889
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,789
stage and then becomes a working group a

890
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,059
tool as the after adoption when things

891
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:09,400
get get later along and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

892
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:15,430
evolution should be part of how we think

893
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:17,079
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well hello I'm binoculars so</font>

894
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,480
I like what you what you wrote right

895
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,400
having RFC producing RFC the same way

896
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,170
with your software so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned the</font>

897
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,710
yang tools and explain what I'm doing

898
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what my main pain point is so</font>

899
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,900
what I'm doing is that every day I'm

900
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,329
looking at all the drafts the new ones I

901
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,150
run a tool to extract a young module

902
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:39,579
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> validate this then I report the</font>

903
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,069
errors to the to the authors now what's

904
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:44,230
happening is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing which is</font>

905
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">very stupid here is that we're asking</font>

906
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,520
people to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> the yang module to</font>

907
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,640
insert it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the txt file which is</font>

908
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,710
posted and extract it then I report

909
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,078
errors on the lines and then the lines

910
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">under the same one that the original</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

911
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,880
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know extra lines whatever</font>

912
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:03,339
because the footer my<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issue here</font>

913
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,980
is that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> distinguish the draft</font>

914
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:09,520
from something which is in there like a

915
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,770
module<font color="#E5E5E5"> emit some code this one if it</font>

916
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,770
would be in github that would help me a

917
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:16,690
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an unsubmitted</font>

918
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft on that that I will submit after</font>

919
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,319
this meeting

920
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:27,230
it's currently on github it's currently

921
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,490
on github you can read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font>

922
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,250
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble finding it in the</font>

923
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:34,790
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so repositories that I have</font>

924
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:37,880
but it covers<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue that you're</font>

925
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:40,070
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I think one of the</font>

926
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,130
ways that github and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this setup can</font>

927
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:46,609
actually help with with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

928
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:49,130
that you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extract the</font>

929
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:50,299
module from the text document because

930
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,030
you know that the authors of that

931
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">document were generating the module</font>

932
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,050
validating the module then inserting it

933
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,380
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be really</font>

934
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonably sure that that process was</font>

935
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,940
followed properly because it was all

936
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,890
automated and I can show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how to set</font>

937
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that up I actually have a draft in the</font>

938
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">TLS working group that has a markdown</font>

939
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:16,400
file that says please run the following

940
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:19,520
test cases in NSS and it scrapes the

941
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,490
test cases for test vectors and then

942
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,170
generates the draft out of that that's

943
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,180
fine what I'm doing with yang is that I

944
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,890
have even commercial tools to validate

945
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,930
those right so it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

946
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes impossible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just say this is</font>

947
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the list of things that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

948
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:36,140
validate so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ITF</font>

949
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:40,250
should take the highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

950
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,980
separate goes to 0 if that that is the

951
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:49,700
point that I'm making my draft it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

952
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:55,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay for some definition fixed where we</font>

953
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,970
means Joe and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi Dave Crocker um so I</font>

954
00:43:55,609 --> 00:44:02,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get the degree of adoption that has</font>

955
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:05,118
already happened and that makes moot any

956
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns one my Gray's about whether it</font>

957
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,320
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopted so any comments i'm</font>

958
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,270
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't raising that</font>

959
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,920
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they might sound like</font>

960
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:18,500
they are we stuck with text only for

961
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,210
rfcs for dramatically longer than

962
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,970
anybody would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have thought was a good</font>

963
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,359
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it because we</font>

964
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:29,089
were encrusted in it there was a

965
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:33,170
facility with it and an ease of access

966
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:35,869
an accessibility that was profound and

967
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,660
Liz and in spite of the fact that we're

968
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:42,380
now using<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML as a base we're actually</font>

969
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,299
producing text documents and and I'm

970
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,970
amused by the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTML version</font>

971
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:49,160
that we produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only a slight</font>

972
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,740
variation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASCII version we don't</font>

973
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:57,160
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use pretty HTML to the extent we</font>

974
00:44:51,740 --> 00:45:00,439
could um this conservativeness in

975
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,220
transitioning over to more powerful and

976
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:09,920
more complex tools is something that we

977
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:12,828
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget the benefit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um the barrier</font>

978
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,170
to entry with github compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

979
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:20,359
barrier to entry of generating forgive

980
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:22,730
me a text document is huge so the

981
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:27,190
benefits are significant but we can get

982
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:29,569
lost in in the the enthusiasm of that

983
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:35,450
forgetting that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just raised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

984
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:38,619
bar for entry um I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where to</font>

985
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">go with that concern other than up here</font>

986
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">raising</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flag about it and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

987
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:48,649
the comments being made I think reduced

988
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,690
to we need to figure out more careful

989

discipline for using this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't i</font>

990
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,109
say more careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean that</font>

00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are doing anything wrong i think</font>

00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're not necessarily thinking</font>

993
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:01,490
carefully enough about the selectivity

994
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,069
that we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and there's</font>

995
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:09,078
any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of comments that i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font>

996
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:11,630
into that view<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm suggesting that we we</font>

997
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:14,270
take a beat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about it more</font>

998
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:17,869
carefully in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I'm assuming this</font>

event is actually in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

1000
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,390
of that goal isn't very much like we've

1001
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:25,160
put a fair amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought into that</font>

1002
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,859
so I'd encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look at the link</font>

1003
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,420
that I gave that on jabber we've been

1004
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:30,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">very conscious to make sure that someone</font>

00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">participate in the activity and I'd</font>

1008
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,299
actually push back on your

1009
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,279
characterization that we're raising the

dramatically lowering the bar that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows</font>

00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're getting implementers and</font>

talk about their issue and then get out

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,569
and and and to add to that the the

access to tools that help you in that

1024

1027
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,709
throw it at the wall and it tends to

<font color="#E5E5E5">stick at that point as opposed as</font>

point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's really no way to</font>

1036
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:46,440
either send a PR or file an issue

1037
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,150
without having seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the the note</font>

1038
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,430
well so that's for the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

1039
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:54,539
concerned about you know blue sheet

1040
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:56,129
style issues that's at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1041
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,640
mitigations for that and we can track

1042
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:02,359
you back to to your account on github if

1043
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,308
you send a pull request or file an issue

1044
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:07,140
actually Michael before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start a you</font>

1045
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:14,249
said blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheet show who has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not signed</font>

1046
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:15,808
the blue sheet okay witness<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms room so-</font>

1047
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:19,049
michael richardson can you go back to

00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:20,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the diagram with the circle the last the</font>

1051
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:30,690
significant things here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1052
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,609
your document maybe it was in this one

1053
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,829
it was in the previous one oh there we

1054
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:38,038
go yeah that one that one so the answer

1055
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:40,499
is yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so um so</font>

1056
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that that I think that is a</font>

1057
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:49,169
big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> um is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> despite the lovely</font>

1059
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:56,400
through the meeting still exists and

1060
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:59,430
it's a I think I think it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1061
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,040
little bit jarring to a design team that

1062
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,859
has been iterating quite

1063
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,870
quickly for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inanimate strap</font>

1064
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,820
design team we had weekly conference

1065
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,350
calls and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> aruna while we're</font>

1066
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not using her make file we're using one</font>

1067
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:17,210
that we found simpler and less capable

1068
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:19,069
more suited to our stupidity that that

1069
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,080
that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that and it was great</font>

1070
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said very consciousness that oh my</font>

1071
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,259
goodness we're going to go talk to a

1072
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,990
working group half of whom hasn't read

1073
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,190
our document of course and so it doesn't

1074
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,020
know what changes we're talking about

1075
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and why we changed our mind six times</font>

1076
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:36,050
between each Tuesday right of our

1077
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,270
meeting and so I think that's is that

1078
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:41,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the part of the problem that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1079
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:43,670
have between say for instance where<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

1080
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,009
Crocker is and this is that we're

1081
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:49,970
iterating an awfully fat awfully fast

1082
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:53,060
there and that's good but that we have

1083
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:55,430
an impedance mismatch with a larger

1084
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,320
group and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing so one of</font>

1085
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:01,520
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is i would</font>

1086
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually publish an awfully long email</font>

1087
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,440
you know 500 lines or something long

1088
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,779
which was our notes of our thing and i

1089
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,970
would try to condense our diffs and awe

1090
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,540
and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did back to the</font>

1091
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:16,970
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now and then there's</font>

1092
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone pull something out of of it</font>

1093
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,870
right in the middle and there's a big

1094
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,000
rat hole there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're want to talk</font>

1095
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:25,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's good because they paid</font>

1096
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,410
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read that far and I think</font>

1097
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're not doing that then you're</font>

1098
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,700
probably making a mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1099
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,859
causing in penis mismatch and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1100
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,500
I think the caution that that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1101
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:40,340
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to make that a common</font>

1102
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:43,070
activity yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in in this</font>

1103
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,860
situation it's it's really almost

1104
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,750
crucial in some circumstances to take

1105
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,310
that the changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think are</font>

1106
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,100
significant and take them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list</font>

1107
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,570
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just just move them across their</font>

1108
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,950
say I've opened the following pull

1109
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">request we've had some discussion there</font>

1110
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,669
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the right way forward</font>

1111
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pros and cons and</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking and how you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

1113
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:08,060
point in a concise email that identifies

00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:10,339
that issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I found that that drawing</font>

1115
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,950
the larger group into that particular

1116
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:15,050
conversation does a lot to validate the

designs earlier

1118
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,040
rather than waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the right</font>

eventual explosion when it when people

go hey and ends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the origin of</font>

about posting your internet-drafts

it can we just post this now before we

that's controversial let's get the thing

1127
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,570
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that the diff tool can really</font>

1128
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,490
clearly say to people and here was the

1129
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,980
controversial change between version 4

1130
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:48,430
and version 5 and there are other stuff

1131
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,840
between version 3 in version four was

1132
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,580
editorial nitpicky blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah we</font>

1133
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,010
reformatted this we moved some text here

1134
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:57,650
we did that and just do that and not

1135
00:51:55,010 --> 00:52:00,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait till the Monday or two weeks ago to</font>

1136
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,000
do it or when week ago and I that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

1137
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,350
that's what is the origin of Iran

1138
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I was actually trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get my</font>

1139
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,130
co-authors in some cases like<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we</font>

1140
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,500
just publish this already<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

1141
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:12,500
reluctance and in some cases academics

1142
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,480
who just wouldn't publish a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 until it</font>

1143
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,430
was perfect and like oh come on you keep

1144
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing your mind can we like have some</font>

1145
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:20,810
points so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can point that the thing i</font>

1146
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:23,960
like the version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versions ago not the</font>

1147
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:26,299
version 6 get commits under hash ID blah

1148
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,620
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah whatever right and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1149
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,060
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build to do that so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1150
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,290
that's that's what I want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

1151
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is wonderful and I've been</font>

1152
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing it for as long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you</font>

1153
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,200
know for my own stuff but but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1154
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,290
got is still respect the rest of the

1155
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,259
loop I think we're still finding our way

1156
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,370
on the right pace to publish drafts at

1157
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,530
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually brought to</font>

1158
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:47,029
mind was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find we don't need</font>

1159
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,430
design teams as much with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font>

1160
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,900
that the github issue has actually

1161
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:54,020
become little miniature design teams

1162
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,580
that self coalesce and you don't need to

1163
00:52:54,020 --> 00:53:00,320
have this formalism where you break off

1164
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:05,509
and then bring something back<font color="#E5E5E5"> hilal this</font>

1165
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:10,670
from and speaking of some experience in

1166
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:12,730
the WTC of work doing github one of the

1167
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,450
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not been mentioned is</font>

1168
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:20,090
the actual properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bug tracker</font>

1169
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:24,500
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did was we switched</font>

1170
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:26,960
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugzilla to get hubs is your</font>

1171
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,770
tracker and

1172
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:34,270
it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear from the ease of using</font>

1173
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:39,200
it to tools that less is definitely more

1174
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:45,640
so I've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appreciate this and most</font>

1175
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:48,500
things in building process which is that

1176
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:55,210
often the best process is the one that

1177
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:59,650
isn't there switching switching points

1178
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:05,020
is there such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short line behind me and</font>

1179
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:10,760
consensus on issues has very frequently

1180
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:13,700
in our contexts been the mailing list

1181
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,290
knows that the issue has been raised the

1182
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,310
mailing list knows that there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

1183
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:23,120
resolution and the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who really</font>

1184
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:29,529
care i agree with a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1185
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:33,589
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical way of measuring</font>

1186
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:41,480
consensus and this works fairly well

1187
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:43,670
with github issues now this doesn't fit

1188
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,440
the description that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the RFC is</font>

1189
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:52,340
that the IDF lives and dies by that I

1190
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:56,090
think it's in practice quite useful what

1191
00:54:52,340 --> 00:55:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">we should be sure of is that anyone who</font>

1192
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:07,730
follows the work cannot claim to have

1193
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:11,740
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if he has fun he has read</font>

1194
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:15,170
read the standard means of communication

1195
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:21,319
as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> he cannot claim to be</font>

1196
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:24,710
surprised he I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the point of</font>

1197
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:31,010
consensus has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> preserved even though</font>

1198
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:32,540
the RFC's Rek about it so

1199
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:35,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Keith before you step up to the mic we</font>

have five minutes left area directors

1204
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,310
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> then okay keith moore i'll try</font>

1205
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,770
to be brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do have two points in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1206
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:53,330
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> word when the slide was up</font>

1207
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,400
there that says we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop</font>

1208
00:55:53,330 --> 00:56:00,350
documents like we do open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

1209
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:02,270
software my first thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> was but good</font>

1210
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,650
open source software and a good

1211
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,290
standards document really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very</font>

1212
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,630
different characteristics and the tools

1213
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you use to collaborate affect the</font>

1214
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:15,230
product in in both good and bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1215
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,549
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a great idea I</font>

1216
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:19,850
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it exported I'm not trying</font>

1217
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to discourage use of these tools but a</font>

1218
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:24,830
good standards document in my mind has

1219
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,990
coherence and that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> editors</font>

1220
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:28,759
have gone through and made decisions

1221
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:32,419
about what to include and what not to

1222
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:34,700
include and often a standard is better

1223
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,920
when it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> fewer features and one of</font>

1224
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,529
the problems I've seen both with

00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,690
collaborative collaboratively edited

1226
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,550
documents and with open source software

1227
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,010
they had a lot of contributors is

1228
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,600
creeping feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

1229
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a standard so</font>

1230
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,069
I'm interested to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you can you</font>

1231
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,500
know take the process and use these

1232
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,700
tools in such a way that doesn't

1233
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,680
contribute to creeping fig tourism and

1234
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,930
standards yeah just just to respond to

1235
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Keith I've worked in a number of</font>

1236
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:04,460
different standard or standards

1237
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:06,500
organizations and this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1238
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,360
one place that I've been that doesn't

1239
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,620
suffer from that all of the other

1240
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,830
standards bodies that I've participated

1241
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:16,250
in have massive problems with feature

1242
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:18,380
creep and I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a sim</font>

1243
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:20,960
product of the maturity of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1244
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,700
involved and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> culture and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1245
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,080
discipline that's applied to the

1246
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,240
development of the standard I don't

1247
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:30,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's got a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal to do with</font>

1248
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,779
the tools I've seen the w3c work on on

1249
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,100
things they use github they use a very

1250
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:37,390
similar process to what we're using an

1251
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:41,029
HTTP beers and yet they produce

1252
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:44,690
sometimes documents that are just as

1253
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:48,319
creepy as you can imagine

1254
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:49,700
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I don't I don't believe me p by</font>

1255
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,529
the way I don't think the tools

1256
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,029
necessarily i guess i would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1257
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,609
extent<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have that coherence it's</font>

1258
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:57,710
because there is a document editor or a

1259
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:59,660
small number of document editor who are

1260
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,910
dedicated to making that happen I don't

1261
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:04,578
want to lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay and that's</font>

1262
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:07,368
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that my document</font>

1263
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:10,369
talks about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit I didn't</font>

1264
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:11,960
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here but I should have which</font>

1265
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:14,180
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the properties</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

1266
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,060
actually getting is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the editors</font>

1267
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:19,129
become custodians of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document rather</font>

1268
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,078
than actually being responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1269
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:23,599
writing all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and that is a</font>

1270
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:25,700
huge advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> for editors particularly</font>

1271
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,040
being an editor on a number of those

1272
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:32,000
documents um but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have that</font>

1273
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:34,670
that level of editorial review nothing

1274
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,430
is quite um second point is that any

1275
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:40,849
time I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to try to like assess</font>

1276
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:43,578
this sort of mental state all the ideas

1277
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:46,730
and the decisions taken in this kind of

1278
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:48,500
thing and there's been multiple sources

1279
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,410
of this information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in</font>

1280
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:53,329
disparate places it becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so</font>

1281
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,589
I think doing it when everything was

1282
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,180
done on the mailing list you knew where

1283
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,920
to find all this stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1284
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,328
mailing list if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

1285
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,500
github and some things in a bug tracking

1286
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:02,450
system that something's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah mailing</font>

1287
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,880
list I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that potentially becomes a</font>

1288
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,890
bigger problem so just something to

1289
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,319
think about and that they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up in</font>

1290
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:11,359
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> inbox anyway everything ends up in my</font>

1291
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:13,940
inbox anyway so it's all the same to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1292
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,348
so now it's worse it rapidly running out

1293
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,630
of time so if we get very very much

1294
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:19,849
directly as the one I want to echo back

1295
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,640
the contribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> or like a blue sheet</font>

1296
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:24,920
one so I think you already mentioned

1297
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the github is has a facility to</font>

1298
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,480
specify contribution guide which you

1299
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:32,420
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look except in which is standard</font>

1300
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,369
for all of the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source software</font>

1301
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,380
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept some contribution</font>

1302
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:38,810
guide in order to contribute and the

1303
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,490
second one I like github get up is a

1304
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,589
great tool but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1305
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:45,709
recoverability for issues and pull

1306
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:47,839
request is either possible or available

1307
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:50,480
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this moment it is possible we do it</font>

1308
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so and we'll have so if you come to</font>

1309
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mailing list there there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1310
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on the tools to do that so</font>

1311
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,580
cohen-chang a fan of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and think</font>

1312
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can solve these problems easily</font>

1313
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,210
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to take the IPR</font>

1314
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:04,549
problems very<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious and that many of</font>

1315
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">us are being sued right now over a</font>

1316
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:09,290
lawsuit that were largely turn on

1317
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:12,319
whether somebody was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in violation in bc</font>

1318
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:14,779
78 or not and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money and</font>

1319
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,310
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be traced back to actual</font>

1320
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,660
people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wednes blue sheets it's easy</font>

1321
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,640
to do in this year you dear there's a

1322
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:24,259
community you know that but when it's

1323
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,549
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> XX 27 on github it's really</font>

1324
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard to correlate that with a real</font>

1325
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,850
persons name so I I want us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move to</font>

1326
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,530
those types of tools and take things

1327
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,360
from people that maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never meet in</font>

1328
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:35,000
person but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1329
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to actually address the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

1330
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,920
issues that come out of that as well

1331
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:43,010
yeah so yeah so the w3c is it true is

1332
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,240
good but it typically didn't write and

1333
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:47,150
we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a time where we're</font>

1334
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,799
hoping it typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> does well as Martin</font>

1335
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,420
said that the pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> request we're taking</font>

1336
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,460
now tend to be drive by spelling checks

1337
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,750
when it's a meteor feature they have to

1338
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,880
get more involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion</font>

1339
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,320
itself well all I'm saying is I think we

1340
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get very seriously looking at</font>

1341
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,630
this experience of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fort of educating</font>

1342
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,780
our editors on what's major and what's

1343
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,280
not magic major<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay at which I suspect</font>

1344
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,740
that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martins look he doesn't know</font>

1345
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,870
and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is looking</font>

1346
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,330
at the the what for the ones that are

1347
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:15,980
major what what is our bar so w3c has a

1348
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,660
very clear one right and they understand

1349
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,800
it they have tools that enforce it we

1350
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,569
can have all those things i'm nots just

1351
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,580
so we need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think these</font>

1352
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,590
are problems we can solve easily I'm

1353
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,390
just saying we need to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> any cuts so</font>

1354
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,340
so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push back just a little</font>

1355
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,920
bit on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1356
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:34,340
general sentiment all we have right now

1357
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an email address from some</font>

1358
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:42,380
participants true we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

1359
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:44,120
in github when someone makes a

1360
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:47,600
contribution that I actual material

1361
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:49,490
contribution we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same just</font>

1362
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even necessarily not if they delete</font>

1363
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,040
their github account because we're

1364
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,840
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one of those know you</font>

1365
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,550
actually you actually get that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1366
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,170
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metadata and it's recorded in my</font>

1367
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,340
district even with the email just I

1368
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's the email address that</font>

1369
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,340
was necessarily important in here I mean

1370
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,170
I'd like I mean I use fluffy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I i</font>

1371
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've her but even though often mind yet</font>

1372
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:07,940
San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that often we do</font>

1373
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,190
through the community process of

1374
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,900
participating in meetings know who the

1375
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,279
people are and no and makes

1376
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,020
somewhat different and that we're trying

1377
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make that more remote and accessible</font>

1378
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,500
to more people it's a good thing but we

1379
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,440
need to trust that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're over</font>

1380
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,839
so pleasing quite Lou burger another way

1381
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,500
to ask that question is how does the ITF

1382
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:34,099
respond to a subpoena<font color="#E5E5E5"> to information on</font>

1383
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:36,529
github<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thank you you too and we</font>

1384
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:40,130
have some closing remarks please uh yeah

1385
01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:42,079
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alyssa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cooper so I thought this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1386
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fantastic discussion thank you</font>

1387
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">all for initiating it and all of you for</font>

1388
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:49,190
contributing I'm trimming on the list I

1389
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,509
think you are now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of</font>

1390
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:53,059
chatting about what are the takeaways in

1391
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:56,059
the next steps and it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1392
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:59,569
there's really a few different

1393
01:02:56,059 --> 01:03:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of potential future work here</font>

1394
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:03,170
or future areas of exploration so

1395
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,390
there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the level of the</font>

1396
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:07,430
principles which is kind of encompassed

1397
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:09,680
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> marks document i think that's that's</font>

1398
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:13,609
one thing there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think questions</font>

1399
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:16,339
around four working groups that are

1400
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:18,859
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upgrade their tooling or</font>

1401
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:20,690
start using github more but aren't

1402
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:23,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">really using it right now there's</font>

1403
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:26,059
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of experience now in the</font>

1404
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,529
IETF and I think there's questions to

1405
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:31,130
explore about how do we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier</font>

1406
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:33,140
for new people different people who want

1407
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:35,329
to adopt or you know learn from what

1408
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:37,160
what we've already learned how do we

1409
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:38,510
make that easier so there's part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1410
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,859
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about best practices and part</font>

1411
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:42,380
of it which might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some tooling</font>

1412
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:44,359
that we could provide as the ITF so

1413
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,220
that's another the third one gets to

1414
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:47,569
Martin's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the sort</font>

1415
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:50,270
of philosophy of how we develop

1416
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:52,549
documents and four groups that really

1417
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,630
want to be more on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cutting edge or</font>

1418
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:55,730
experimenting with that sort of thing

1419
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:58,579
again are there things that we could do

1420
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:01,099
help or make that easier or make it more

1421
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:04,130
acceptable in the community or<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1422
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:06,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups that's that's another one and</font>

1423
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:09,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">then lastly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think there was this</font>

1424
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,910
question raised both bye bye<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike bishop</font>

1425
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:14,210
and by Harold that is a little bit

1426
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:15,770
thorny or about you know does the does

1427
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,890
you know potential adoption of a new

1428
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:20,960
tool by by some parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

1429
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:23,390
imply anything about how we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1430
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,980
about how we gather consensus and how we

1431
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,430
make decisions and should the mailing

1432
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,550
list still

1433
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:30,890
rule the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day that's obviously a question</font>

1434
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:34,460
that needs a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more further deeper</font>

1435
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:36,109
thought I tend to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that even if we</font>

1436
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,690
you know go down the path<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a</font>

1437
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:40,369
good discussion about that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1438
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:42,530
tooling perspective we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to</font>

1439
01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:43,790
make it such that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use</font>

1440
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,079
the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are comfortable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font>

1441
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:48,430
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't hear anybody</font>

1442
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:51,020
arguing for let's get rid of or you know

1443
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,509
prohibit that any tools that we already

1444
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">use which i think is good but we're</font>

1445
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:57,050
mostly talking about adding and you know

1446
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:58,670
adopting different models for different

1447
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:01,010
crowds but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that is like a</font>

1448
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,050
process point that if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1449
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,490
debate that then I encourage you to take

1450
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to the to the mailing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list we're</font>

1451
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:09,290
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the mailing list open and</font>

1452
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:12,410
I think for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of those areas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1453
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:13,940
just listed probably further debate and

1454
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:16,040
discussion on the mailing list is is the

1455
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,359
right next step<font color="#CCCCCC"> if people think there's</font>

1456
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things we should use except for</font>

1457
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,740
the consensus question I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

1458
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:23,359
one yeah and I believe people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1459
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:26,450
agree with me that should be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font>

1460
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:29,058
general but i think the how do you do it

1461
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:30,589
but I'm sorry so we could have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1462
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:35,569
this mailing list but then it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> all get</font>

1463
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:37,460
repeated on IETF um yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I</font>

1464
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:40,069
kind of like when these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things start</font>

1465
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,589
smaller and and then and then go big

1466
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:44,630
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's so it's so bound</font>

1467
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:46,160
up with the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tooling right</font>

1468
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:47,569
like that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to talk</font>

1469
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,910
about it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because they got</font>

1470
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:51,500
second so another channel is then even

1471
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:53,450
though this mailing list is called IHF

1472
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,700
and github it it is somewhat at this

1473
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:59,240
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf and tooling that seems to</font>

1474
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,339
lean towards github yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1475
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:03,410
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is okay for now people</font>

1476
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:06,259
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change it but it's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1477
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:08,089
focuses obviously I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna so yeah so</font>

01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,339
you know please keep contributing on the

1479
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:13,150
