33
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,219
I would like to thank Derek for all his

34
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:58,099
work over a couple of years and you've

35
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,959
seen he has been in worked in other

36
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:03,950
activities now and unfortunately had to

37
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,200
leave or I've stopped co-chairing the

38
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:10,599
working group so Kathleen drop put out

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,888
the message asking for volunteers to

40
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:19,810
take a seat next to me in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

41
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:22,130
upcoming meetings so think about that um

42
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:29,330
for some reason the blue sheets are not

43
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:35,090
here either they are here what Hannah

44
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,710
run um so I took a look before the

45
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,049
meeting right before the meeting I took

46
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,909
a look at the website and notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,970
most of our milestones were out of date

48
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:45,830
so identity updated them so when we go

49
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,599
through the items<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should also</font>

50
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:54,680
think about the completion date of those

51
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:56,840
um yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the oil</font>

52
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,789
security topics document to the

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:05,388
milestone list which Kesley needs to

54
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:07,070
approve as well here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda um we</font>

55
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,780
need we need to do a little bit of a

56
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,969
gender bashing because some of the

57
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,729
presenters are not here on friday which

58
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:22,699

hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody William Dennis product</font>

72
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,448
manager at Google so I'm talking today

73
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,839
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dodo device flow</font>

74
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,819
draft so i'll just start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a quick</font>

75
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,399
recap for anyone who's unfamiliar what

76
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,800
this draft is so this is an

77
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,119
authorization flow that's specifically

78
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,619
designed for devices that have an

79
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:39,689
internet connection but they don't have

80
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:43,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">a browser or they have limited input or</font>

81
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,759
some combination of that in this flow

82
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,439
the user will actually review the

83
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,599
authorization request on a secondary

84
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:52,509
device so this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be their their</font>

85
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:57,380
phone or it could be a laptop

86
00:07:52,509 --> 00:08:00,470
he's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a an example of a app on a</font>

87
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,380
TV so it's displaying the the coat the

88
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,320
URL that the user has to visit and enter

89
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the code so the usual basically just go</font>

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,449
to that URL end of the code approve the

91
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,550
request while<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is happening the</font>

92
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,699
device is actually polling the token

93
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,320
endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the user does complete</font>

94
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,110
the section then they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back either</font>

95
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,889
a authorization granted or authorization

96
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,220
rejected these codes typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

97
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:30,919
expiry so after about 30 minutes for

98
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,409
example this would this would end up not

99
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,020
working so the requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that</font>

100
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,520
indicate internet connection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> display</font>

101
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,409
mechanism so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't matter</font>

102
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,569
what that mechanism is it could be could

103
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,218
be visual could be audio but there needs

104
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,260
to be some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way for the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

105
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,640
actually instruct the user what that

106
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,020
code is so it doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a two-way</font>

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,420
connection to the user's device so

108
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,279
that's an important distinction what

109
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,150
this means is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

110
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">apps like say an Xbox app or a smart TV</font>

111
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,480
app various different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps that</font>

112
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are capable of connecting the internet</font>

113
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not capable of communicating</font>

114
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,880
with the local device that don't have

115
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of convenient input mechanisms</font>

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,870
or a browser so broadly applicable to

117
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:18,170
that class so TV apps printers um you

118
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,480
know it what it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is a device</font>

119
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,550
that has a browser and a rich input

120
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,130
mechanism of its own and I guess there

121
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,199
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some exceptions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this but but</font>

122
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,410
broadly speaking you know those devices

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,110
like iOS or Android or Windows or Mac

124
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,199
device should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using just regular</font>

125
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:40,250
earth to using the earth to net for

126
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,680
native apps PCP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

127
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,230
changes since last time it has a new and

128
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,469
fairly unwieldy name the name is

129
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,200
attempting to to explain the type of

130
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,470
device so this is applicable to avoiding

131
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,300
conflicts with other ones we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

132
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,770
have input on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name but preferably on</font>

133
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list so that we don't waste peoples</font>

134
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,160
important time here

135
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,720
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we're trying to make is</font>

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your device has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a browser the</font>

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,740
keyboard then this probably isn't the

138
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,349
old<font color="#CCCCCC"> flu that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

139
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,190
other change was we had this parameter

140
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,710
that was basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a knob response type</font>

141
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:20,020
in the device authorization request I

142
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,060
think this was a holdover from when the

143
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,520
spec was sort of more closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to</font>

144
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the oauth2 authorization flow it just</font>

145
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of stayed in there turned out no</font>

146
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,680
one was actually implementing it so when

147
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,910
we deleted it we looked at Google's

148
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,410
implementation we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it</font>

149
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,760
Justin looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> miter</font>

150
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,439
implementation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they weren't using</font>

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,270
it though there weren't even won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

152
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">like mostly ignoring it was just</font>

153
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,520
completely ignored so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font>

154
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance if anyone would like to preserve</font>

155
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,699
this like potential extension point

156
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,500
speak now or forever hold your peace<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

157
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,560
I will point out that the device

158
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,130
authorization endpoint is not the old

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,170
authorization avoid this is a really

160
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,490
important distinction to make these are

161
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,610
completely separate endpoints and

162
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,260
there's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for this the OAuth</font>

163
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,550
authorization in point is assuming that

164
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,860
there's a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> station that there's a</font>

165
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,839
user agent and user interaction whereas

166
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,130
the device authorization endpoint is is

167
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,400
more of a back-channel thing that the

168
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,710
device is doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to pull down just</font>

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,090
to initiate the device authorization

170
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:22,020
request the other change this was a

171
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,940
suggestion by James manager from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telstra</font>

172
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:28,270
was to provide a standardized way of

173
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,730
embedding the code in the verification

174
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,920
your eye now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this what we came up</font>

175
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,850
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly straightforward method of</font>

176
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,699
composition now importantly this is an

177
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,740
optional enhancement so a server who is

178
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,540
receiving this verification your eye

179
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,360
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have to honor the fact that the</font>

180
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,740
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on that URL that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,510
important point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients cannot</font>

182
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,370
actually assume that that that will be

183
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,069
processed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a hint more than it</font>

184
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:57,370
is anything else the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind that</font>

185
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,710
is mostly security so we have some

186
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,630
concerns around this device flu that it

187
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,870
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> open some avenues to phishing</font>

188
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,610
attacks and by embedding the code in

189
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,470
there is sort of it potentially makes

190
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that easier so we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to force</font>

191
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,710
authorization servers to process that

192
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,430
authorization so is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that due process is</font>

193
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,260
probably

194
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,329
want to have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth like</font>

195
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,279
pairing confirmation screen using that

196
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,880
value rather than just simply accepting

197
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,500
any continuing for that reason you

198
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically want some evidence or you want</font>

199
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user to confirm that they are</font>

200
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,359
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their device that has this</font>

201
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,790
code or they just heard their device

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,670
that has this code not that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

203
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,640
clicked a link on an email oh there I

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,370
maybe wasn't there I mean there is yours

205
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,430
you're still sort of opening yourself up

206
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,220
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of an attacker right so</font>

207
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean the user in my book might okay</font>

208
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,060
that much attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's going</font>

209
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use display a little ok button and</font>

210
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,609
it's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really comfortable to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font>

211
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that ok button right i 100% agree it's</font>

212
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,450
unlikely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google is going to</font>

213
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,760
implement this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's it I can</font>

214
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,850
still see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value to it and the value</font>

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,850
is just demonstrated here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

216
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,589
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the TV app has decided</font>

217
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they you know that say all their</font>

218
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,430
users use QR codes and it would be

219
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,160
convenient to display a QR code and so

220
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,750
in this case it's helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

221
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,140
mechanism of composition of those two

222
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,209
things to avoid them being separate so

223
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,589
the spec now documents that method but

224
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,109
then leaves it up to the authorization

225
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,089
server to decide how to process it so if

226
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide that you're worried the users</font>

227
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,950
won't follow your instructions or won't

228
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,350
when understand what their pairing then

229
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,670
please you know require entry of the

230
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">code this is likely what we're actually</font>

231
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,709
going to do Justin richer yo it's just

232
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to point out that one thing that's</font>

233
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,459
nice about this is that it does degrade

234
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:52,060
nicely it's that if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

235
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:55,300
extra parameters or composing URLs or

236
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,400
whatever on your server you're just

237
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to prompt the user which is what</font>

238
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:06,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do had that not been passed in</font>

239
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:10,300
any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dawson yes and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

240
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,730
yes to this proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the kind of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wake text that we haven't been in the</font>

course pack that leads people<font color="#E5E5E5"> into arm</font>

244
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,860
the kind of what takes sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis get</font>

245
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,689
this kind of text I mean you're

246
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,850
proposing a feature and saying oh you

247
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,890
don't have to implement that and we most

248
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,510
likely will not implement that that's

249
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what you said</font>

250
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,180
for security reasons I assume so why is

251
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,920
ins feature in its back I mean in the

252
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,290
end the device flow is from my

253
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,469
perspective is vulnerable to session

254
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,380
fixation right because you can set up a

255
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,400
transaction and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick the</font>

256
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,980
the user into authorizing access giving

257
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,840
that feature you can fully automatic you

258
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,430
can send a URL to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the victim</font>

259
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,760
clicks on the on the link and if it is a

260
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,680
single sign-on you just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ok</font>

261
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow over on the user content and</font>

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,949
you're done let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me unpack that weight so</font>

263
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,359
firstly i agree with you in general that

264
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad idea to specify things</font>

265
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,900
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people going to use</font>

266
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">i am very much against that so I was</font>

267
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,380
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hesitant to put this in however</font>

268
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,329
this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

269
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,130
are playing to use this so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like</font>

270
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,460
this is something that is going to be

271
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:21,580
used so let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

272
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,810
for a minute then if I was implementing

273
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,550
this how I would do it is i would

274
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,739
display a pairing confirmation screen

275
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,859
much like the bluetooth one to say and

276
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,340
you know have instructions like is your

277
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,400
device displaying this code currently

278
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,570
and you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm saying is i think</font>

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be possible to come up with</font>

280
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,570
user interface that that mitigates that

281
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,310
concern while avoiding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to type</font>

282
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,410
the code in I'm not necessary saying

283
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,689
that I've solved that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

284
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,730
reasonable thing that could be solved

285
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,440
another option<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be to have security</font>

286
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,360
considerations text saying this is a

287
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,940
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad idea if you were to add this</font>

288
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,310
kind of parameter you know here's how

289
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,560
you might do it but it would it will

290
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,910
lead you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things right and you</font>

291
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there is a reason why we're not</font>

292
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,319
putting this in this back ah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

293
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:17,110
convinced that it's a bad idea for

294
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody so a case came up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

295
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,630
weekend where you know there might be a

296
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,420
device that has a QR scanner<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

297
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,740
know i think it's a it's a useful

298
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,479
composition to document and we've

299
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,990
documented in such a way that no one is

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,890
forced to use it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as justin said it</font>

301
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,680
does fall back extremely grace lee so

302
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:41,850
William who proposed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature James</font>

303
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,550
manager he actually put

304
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,389
he actually proposed a feature that

305
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,410
required this code to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> processed</font>

306
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,110
so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed that to be an</font>

307
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,170
optional feature I'm totally surprised

308
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,380
because I I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> James as a very</font>

309
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,899
paranoid to type so type of guy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I</font>

310
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I just took a look on the dr and</font>

311
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,059
into the security conservation section

312
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,010
it discusses this a kind of attack it's

313
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:11,699
called remote fishing but I think it

314
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs more more more fully analysis and</font>

315
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,880
discussion because I'm not really

316
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,119
convinced that this cannot be utilized

317
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,679
in a combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fishing with click</font>

318
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,479
checking and all this stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

319
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,459
the end of you just everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do is</font>

320
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,220
show a confirmation screen then<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

321
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker could also get past this</font>

322
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,890
confirmation screen if you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

323
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:36,929
require an input by the user so it still

324
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,460
has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause a mixed feeling I mean what</font>

325
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,840
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supplied over the</font>

326
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,070
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> character I mean there's a lot of</font>

327
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do right if you</font>

328
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:48,090
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what or second set off mic is</font>

329
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:51,539
that it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> described and Justin</font>

330
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,740
richer again and yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that if</font>

331
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,919
we're going to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font>

332
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,870
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have some security and</font>

333
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,700
privacy considerations about what this

334
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,580
could leak if things go wrong and

335
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:09,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot the other consideration is that</font>

336
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:13,260
it is really really hard to spell out ux

337
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,530
in a spec like this for things as

338
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,500
diverse as I authorization servers so

339
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:24,030
the best we could do if we're to include

340
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,159
this as a feature is to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font>

341
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,500
of one way that might not be horrible

342
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,799
but requirements beyond that I think

343
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,990
might be lost yeah we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna soul</font>

344
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,330
uses randomly clicking on things I

345
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">running through too quickly naka songs</font>

346
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,260
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all that in the spec right now</font>

347
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,720
it's all fishing in this bag<font color="#CCCCCC"> william and</font>

348
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,220
would would it be fantasy to ask the

349
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
group whether they actually want things

350
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,280
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that featured in the upcoming would</font>

351
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,809
happen i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fair I mean I'm so</font>

352
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,870
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear of anyone that wants</font>

353
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,850
to use this as you know since there is

354
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,518
additional risk that we one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

355
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,049
document the risk right

356
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,669
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everyone agrees that this</font>

357
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,408
is taken slightly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk so I think</font>

358
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we want to do is if anyone who</font>

359
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,970
actually needs this they should get that

360
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:08,759
on the record i guess as as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

361
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,110
introducing that risk III think I would

362
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,940
be happy to put James manager on his

363
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,019
behalf on there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he proposed it</font>

364
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,389
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are other use</font>

365
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:22,499
cases like one that I'm deploying right

366
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:24,979
now where the the verification step is

367
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:28,100
not happening in a traditional you know

368
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,450
plucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user with their smartphone</font>

369
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,379
typing in or clicking on a URL or

370
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,090
something like that our use case is not

371
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:38,730
to get into too many details<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is a</font>

372
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">two device use case but the secondary</font>

373
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:46,080
device requires and authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font>

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,019
from a trusted system and a trusted

375
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,840
third party not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user themselves</font>

376
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,239
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a device verification kind of</font>

377
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,609
flow it technologically fits perfectly

378
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,669
with the device flow hence why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree</font>

379
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:01,139
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the title is terrible but again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

380
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:04,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">here suggestions welcome all this</font>

381
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:05,998
absolutely but that's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far I would</font>

382
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">have just worked fine but the current</font>

383
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,509
document doesn't require that extension

384
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,499
it doesn't require the extension but the

385
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,539
way that we're doing the Vice

386
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:15,359
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> in arm at the trusted thing</font>

387
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:17,789
this would make it a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

388
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,418
right but we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> also get around</font>

389
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:23,309
without having this uh just as easily

390
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,049
and so in your case<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrot me if I'm</font>

391
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:27,330
wrong but you have educated and trained

392
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,190
uses right we don't have educated

393
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,809
trained users we have educated trained

394
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:36,330
third parties to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font>

395
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,389
educated third parties are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that</font>

396
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,129
are in charge of example.com / device

397
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:44,549
and users aren't going there on their

398
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:46,590
own browsers so you can yeah so I think

399
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:48,330
the concerns of blindly clicking through

400
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,570
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesser concerning the automatically</font>

401
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,460
and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I think that's actually why</font>

402
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,678
it's worth having this document it's

403
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,330
it's wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a discussion of</font>

404
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,970
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it should be included</font>

405
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,590
because honestly in our case that's so

406
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">far outside of the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

407
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,600
a third party and a trusted kiosk and

408
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,189
stuff we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need it to be</font>

409
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,259
the device URL

410
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:18,029
it has that parameter in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

411
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:20,639
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so yea Lucy Lynch n SRC</font>

412
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:23,460
so honis asked if we should pull the

413
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:25,500
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I actually called sparkly</font>

414
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,490
unicorns here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you have</font>

415
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,169
enough data referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to several people</font>

416
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've heard from might have a use</font>

417
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:37,169
case without any background<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the</font>

418
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,629
specifics of why they have a use case

419
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:43,559
and Justin just said he can get by

420
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:46,610
without it I would really like to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

421
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,980
example of something that a requirement

422
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:53,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need this feature that's for you</font>

423
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,990
add it to the list I mean yeah so I find

424
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:57,479
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> any interesting position here</font>

425
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">because actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opposed this before I</font>

426
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,700
wrote before I wrote a version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

427
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,740
that that literally here's a I post it

428
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,269
and until I sort understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> lemoore and</font>

429
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I attempted to write a version that I</font>

430
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,960
would become too with even from that

431
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">position of being skeptical I think</font>

432
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,379
that's a very good point i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

433
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,970
anyone who wants this probably we wanted

434
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them speak up and make sure that</font>

435
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a validated use case i</font>

436
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:26,309
completely agree so Joe John Brooke it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">not working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John Bradley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so I have</font>

438
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:34,950
talked to people doing more industrial

439
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,509
IOT as opposed to consumer IOT where

440
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,539
they have a trusted portal that they're

441
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:42,120
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to register devices in and one of</font>

442
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:46,110
the requirements is to have more entropy

443
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:49,229
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code primarily because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they</font>

444
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,379
have no UI on the actual device itself

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,750
their pre printing this on a sticker<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

446
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:58,500
pre-registering it so what they want I

447
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,750
have had people say yes what we want to

448
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">do is to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to scan the QR code is</font>

449
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:07,080
part of the registration process without

450
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,409
having to have the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually type</font>

451
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,658
in the excellent piece of information so

452
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:17,090
that that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into extremely scoped</font>

453
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:22,399
cases which requires extremely scope

454
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,399
documentation or security considerations

455
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:29,820
so I'm Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> Medlen we also have the same</font>

456
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:33,120
case that John describes as far as

457
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,769
blocks are concerned and manufactures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

458
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,870
blocks that we've talked to to have them

459
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:39,059
to have this actually etched in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock</font>

460
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,010
we're right you end up just taking a pic

461
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,600
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wind up taking a picture of</font>

462
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,750
it and going that way so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

463
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,658
it is a scoped scoped at all I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

464
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this is manufacturers are doing this</font>

465
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:57,450
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I you know we all</font>

466
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:02,130
know that there are multiple classes of

467
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:04,860
IOT things that are IOT devices well

468
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:09,360
constrained devices of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts so I</font>

469
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,580
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fits some classes of those</font>

470
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,049
devices which isn't necessarily what

471
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:19,199
where we started with TVs show so I

472
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:21,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that as long as we describe you</font>

473
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,210
know the sorts of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this has</font>

474
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:28,559
a benefit to and what the risks of using

475
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,059
it for the wrong kind of device I I

476
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,309
would prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it in the spec</font>

477
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,190
otherwise we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do a</font>

do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> codec spiral once they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

conversation with the device

490

manufacturer that that the notion at the

491
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,179
moment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those codes are only</font>

500
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,970
surprised about this answer

501
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,580
i would i would suggest to to treat this

502
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,340
use case differently and to specify it

503
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,600
differently because if the use is the

504
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,399
dakotas more or less use as an

505
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,350
identifier for the device for

506
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,820
provisioning purposes it is completely

507
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:58,290
different from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the semantics of</font>

508
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:59,939
the device code in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact so maybe</font>

509
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,850
what we should do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also need</font>

510
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,760
to pay attention to the time is we maybe

511
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,590
should move that to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

512
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,970
email list and discuss the requirements

513
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,649
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the source</font>

514
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,820
and said like trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out like</font>

515
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,410
RV ahhhh maybe we I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

516
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this through a little bit more</font>

517
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:21,150
yeah sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like ya but it's just an</font>

518
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,060
interesting fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put on the list</font>

519
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,470
yeah I guess my hypothesis is that it

520
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,750
would be possible to do this in a way

521
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is secure from usability and</font>

522
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,510
therefore we shouldn't prevent it that

523
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,850
was sort of why in the end that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

524
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,710
accepted at this Phi being it so I felt

525
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,300
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't put it past someone to</font>

526
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,860
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good pairing you I that</font>

527
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,389
that really tells use it you know are

528
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,949
you looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV that is applying</font>

529
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,500
that code you know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they</font>

530
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,940
actually I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

531
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,690
belief that is possible means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

532
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:51,300
feel like it's worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Moriarty AG</font>

533
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,830
that just scares<font color="#CCCCCC"> me right I'm a privacy</font>

534
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,510
standpoint I can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the IHG</font>

535
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,760
letting that go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and writing</font>

536
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,300
sorry can you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pricey</font>

537
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,220
concern um you know that that person is

538
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,620
watching that<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV show where they are</font>

539
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,440
that's no no I mean that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

540
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV so like so this is the TV that's</font>

541
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,750
showing the code right and then I scan

542
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,150
the QR code on my TV in my living room

543
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:18,870
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just bought it it says hot it's a</font>

544
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,700
smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV that's not a program it's just</font>

545
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:25,409
a sticker for example I de choses on the

546
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,050
screen oh just for registering<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes</font>

547
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,030
so when I thought you were displaying it

548
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,060
by the way you phrase that last time

549
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,450
well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it is also displayed so I</font>

550
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:39,330
think bellies you let's discuss this on

551
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,780
a minute yeah that's not tried to dig

552
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,399
our said I get a little long a little

553
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,139
bit deeper yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

554
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,390
I don't user privacy concern I mean it's

555
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,809
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user initiated action that they want</font>

556
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,980
to

557
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:54,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">authenticate their device they have</font>

558
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">chosen to it they've chosen to</font>

559
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,590
authenticate their device that's so

560
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,600
there are some examples like you used

561
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,490
the YouTube app you can have like a

562
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,279
printer app so say you want your printer

563
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:08,220
to be connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a document service to</font>

564
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,259
print documents you know printer doesn't

565
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,759
have a browser or keyboard so you go and

566
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to configure box or I want to</font>

567
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,820
configure Google Drive or something and

568
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,620
you click the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

569
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,970
printer is doing this this is displayed

570
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,729
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the printer and then you pull out</font>

571
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,799
your phone you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially scan a</font>

572
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,629
QR code or type in the code and then you

573
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,549
can approve that request for the printer

574
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:28,199
the printer then gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 with access</font>

575
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,779
token it can access your documents in

576
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,179
order for you to print them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

577
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:41,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">user-initiated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floats certainly not any</font>

578
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:42,720
ambient<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we also added security</font>

579
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:44,720
considerations to the document so the

580
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,679
previous drafts actually didn't have any

581
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,809
so so we're covering a whole bunch there

582
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,610
so be good to good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get working group</font>

583
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:58,019
feedback and review on those points and

584
00:28:53,610 --> 00:29:00,059
maybe we can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more okay so this</font>

585
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,149
is a hopefully an uncontroversial change

586
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:05,820
we added a definition for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the earth to</font>

587
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:07,379
authorization server metadata<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

588
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,119
we're already using that I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

589
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,289
drop testing earlier today with if

590
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,119
Justin it's quite useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that as</font>

591
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:18,710
a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of machine readable documentation</font>

592
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:22,769
it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful we also clarified that</font>

593
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,330
the rules around expiry so we do

594
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,429
recommend that their tokens expired at

595
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,439
some point that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really up to you</font>

596
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:30,090
to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> her and and there's no</font>

597
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,179
requirement that they expire but but

598
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:36,809
typically they will and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

599
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:39,990
running code so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s was</font>

600
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:43,080
non-compliant in in two ways one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

601
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,519
that we used grand type that was not the

602
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,009
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the spec so we've actually</font>

603
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,639
already fixed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second is the</font>

604
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:52,889
the code parameter where we're still

605
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:54,689
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using code much like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh as</font>

606
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:57,479
opposed to device code from the spec so

607
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:00,149
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people I spoke to this</font>

608
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,490
week do<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the device code option so</font>

609
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:04,010
we'll probably just up the updating

610
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:10,250
you can view an example at youtube.com

611
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:16,370
slash TV to avoid buying a smart TV to

612
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:18,590
try this so my tid 1.3 will have this

613
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,120
feature reportedly just and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran an</font>

614
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,309
interrupt testing today in the terminal

615
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,350
room and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to work with</font>

616
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:26,540
a few bugs and a few doses and a few

617
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,939
databases they got corrupted but it's

618
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,790
all good so that's open source you

619
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,179
should go to try that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from a client</font>

620
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,830
perspective this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the google specific</font>

621
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:38,809
client so there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

622
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,820
non-compliant but once the spec is

623
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,320
suitably stable we plan to move that

624
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a port and make sure it's a stable</font>

625
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,428
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did upload the code that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I use</font>

626
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,889
with Justin so you can play around with

627
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:51,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you like to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there a couple</font>

628
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,740
of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our implementations as well</font>

629
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,770
writing source implementations right for

630
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,050
arc and they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> European broadcasting</font>

631
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,590
association they also have produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

632
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,879
that they posted on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing is okay</font>

633
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,030
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the ones that I've actually</font>

634
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,270
tried myself that's all yep good perhaps

635
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,700
we should get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> post their code or</font>

636
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:18,620
yeah yeah specifically for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right up</font>

637
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,870
so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi Jim Fenton is there</font>

638
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,928
anything in the spec or any notion of

639
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,790
how to revoke a device authorization in

640
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:29,980
what happens when you sell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV or</font>

641
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:32,450
that printer ok so what never happened

642
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:38,179
or maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should just crush them when</font>

643
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:39,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">their sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of duty so once the once the</font>

644
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,800
Refresh token access<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

645
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,270
granted then it's much like any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other Oh</font>

646
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,399
authorization so i would say nothing

647
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,530
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the method of authorizing</font>

648
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,190
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as if you had</font>

649
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:54,830
a browser and a keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> but right but</font>

650
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,290
but you don't have an interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

651
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,790
device in order to initiate a revocation

652
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,760
from the device when you're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

653
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,470
sell it so i guess most devices that

654
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to have at least like a reset</font>

655
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,800
button that will that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> least drop</font>

656
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,379
all the tokens by by raising the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

657
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:14,440
well you can also revoke its server side

658
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,440
in most implementations so the

659
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:22,649
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely that's</font>

660
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,449
that's a very true IOT problem what I

661
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,550
got up to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out though was it's</font>

662
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,250
important to not confuse the device

663
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,409
authorization code with the access token

664
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,840
that is granted as a result right

665
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,250
properly applying that so there was also

666
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,230
a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the token revocation</font>

667
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,000
specification went through of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

668
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,400
not we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should allow revocation of other</font>

669
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,980
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like authorization codes and all</font>

670
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,370
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> other temporary credentials and</font>

671
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,620
things like that and we as a working

672
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:54,800
group decided that the complexity of

673
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,510
supporting revoking these credentials

674
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,840
which are partial and intended to be

675
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,580
temporary was was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worth sort of the</font>

676
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,060
extra over-engineering that would be

677
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,429
required so<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently there is no</font>

678
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,220
nothing in the spec about revocation

679
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:14,400
also some devices do have enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a UI</font>

680
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just say throw away my</font>

681
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,080
access tokens or<font color="#E5E5E5"> logout I know I can on</font>

682
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,570
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roku with youtube today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can log out</font>

683
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,610
yep today it's as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already</font>

684
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,950
doing this and that's separate from how

685
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,740
it got the tokens that's a really good

686
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,240
point so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flow uses a device</font>

687
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,950
authorization in point but then just the

688
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,720
regular token in point the Refresh token

689
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,310
access token that issued on that token

690
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,890
in point at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our implementation</font>

691
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,000
are exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as any other token</font>

692
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,740
that's issued just<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a little bit of</font>

693
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,450
different metadata attached so yes you

694
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,130
can use all token replication you can

695
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,680
drop them on the floor you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you know</font>

696
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:49,530
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are normally revoking tokens</font>

697
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,660
is a portable that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

698
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,310
certainly a good point<font color="#CCCCCC"> for manufacturers</font>

699
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,540
of those devices they absolutely need a

700
00:33:53,310 --> 00:34:10,520
reset button<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right any further</font>

701
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:10,520
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you Matt</font>

702
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:16,819
so it's hoping like the document is is

703
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:21,259
further along but it was good feedback

704
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:23,179
and so would probably probably take us

705
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say a month to discuss these type</font>

706
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:45,889
of things and then see where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

707
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:49,790
all washes version online give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

708
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:54,220
second cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is centered took</font>

709
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,219
to the thread up

710
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:20,009
is this the new version yes I would i

711
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,160
will upload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most recent version so</font>

712
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:29,360
the guys on the phone yeah not too much

713
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:34,770
change i can also talk about those so

714
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:38,340
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for giving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me time today 4xl</font>

715
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:44,280
describing this old<font color="#CCCCCC"> j-pop thing the</font>

716

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:53,850
parallel document to 6750 which is

718
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:59,130
bearer token usage is this is jay TT pop

719
00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:01,860
tokenization<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we talked about</font>

720
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,740
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this probably two years</font>

721
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,810
or three years ago and then we believe

722
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,160
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tow combining is going to solve</font>

723
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:12,900
them all and we stopped you know

724
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:18,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering these kind of things but</font>

725
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:21,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not quite a case on some</font>

726
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:23,490
circumstances it clearly wasn't the

727
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:27,030
token binding for the short time is not

728
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:30,959
giving us<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for example in the cases</font>

729
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,820
that I'm know about is they can't touch

730
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,800
any restriction<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything has to be</font>

731
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:40,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">done at their application layer and also</font>

732
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,400
need somehow to tie back to tl's client

733
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,780
authentication or something like that

734
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,780
and they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it now for</font>

735
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:56,160
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can open banking they have</font>

736
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:58,260
to call it now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am John so other</font>

737
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:04,220
people came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something called</font>

738
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">j-pop right and i just sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

739
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,490
draft 04 to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list the draft</font>

740
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,689

741
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:19,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">j-pop talkin send that constrain token</font>

742
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:21,119
which is there are two types of them d

743
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint token client ID</font>

744
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,480
constraint talking and then there are

745
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:31,790
key constraint tokens as well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

746
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:35,910
actually described it pretty much in RFC

747
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:39,360
7800 okay and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the</font>

748
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:43,799
resource access method one way to do is

749
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tie into the neutral tils the other</font>

750
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,460
is the signature pretty much as in the

751
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,140
digest authentication and then we talked

752
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,690
a little bit about authorization error

753
00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:02,430
and iono consideration now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> j levity</font>

754
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:06,540
pop token looks like this it has to have

755
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:16,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">ashore audience I at issue that and</font>

756
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:16,100
exploration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirmation object and</font>

757
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,770
confirmation object can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font>

758
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:26,490
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it's saying CN but its</font>

759
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:31,140

760
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:33,868
used to be CN but it's now the end so so

761
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:39,330
in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirmation you just have</font>

762
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:41,790
the end of the string and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then client</font>

763
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:46,710
like ID confirmation method you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

ki d it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerpoint country right and</font>

768
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:05,819
in addition the document has whole bunch

769
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:10,650
of other things which has been defined

770
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:13,650
in inr registry and other documents and

771
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,810
it's a in the discussion point if we

772
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:20,270
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep them all but we have put</font>

773
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:20,270
them all for this document now

774
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:28,320
and then we got resource access method

775
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,570
mutual TLS access method use is<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font>

776
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,580
CN confirmation method and other things

777
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:38,810
and then signature metal for key

778
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:41,310
computation methods and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull I mean the</font>

779
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:45,420
mutual thing else access method I didn't

780
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:49,380
create any special slides because it's

781
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,860
pretty much in just one part of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

782
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:55,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comp confirmation record a</font>

783
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:59,580
confirmation for the call an object

784
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:03,060
actually has much to the what you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

785
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,830
the TLS client authentication so that's

786
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,070
pretty straightforward for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signature</font>

787
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:11,009
method it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as the</font>

788
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:17,540
digest authentication except it's not

789
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:22,710
using md5 but generally yes that's it

790
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:25,290
and downside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not start</font>

791
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,860
standardizing it now is that groups like

792
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:31,550
open banking standards in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK will</font>

793
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:35,100
probably start doing their own things or

794
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:38,820
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mandating anything but the each</font>

795
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">bank start doing their own well how I</font>

796
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:46,410
think the other ability so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

797
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:49,080
a good idea to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here now so</font>

798
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,270
my request<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the working group is to</font>

799
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,580
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt the draft has a working</font>

800
00:40:51,270 --> 00:41:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">group item so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can formally sub</font>

801
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:04,259
discussing that's my last slide so John

802
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,840
Bradley ping so one of the things that's

803
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,730
motivated pushing this forward now we

804
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,460
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we thought about doing it last</font>

805
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:16,050
year in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> year before but without a</font>

806
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,390
clear consumer of this we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

807
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:21,030
confuse people with the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

808
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,379
doing on token binding and I think token

809
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,690
binding is still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right way for</font>

810
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,340
consumer applications but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have banks</font>

811
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,630
that are doing server to server stuff

812
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:34,119
and they have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own CA and they have</font>

813
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:36,490
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own set of laws etc and</font>

814
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,970
you know they're looking for advice how

815
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:45,249
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do mutual TLS proof of</font>

816
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:47,939
possession with oh I so having something

817
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:51,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss with them</font>

818
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,990
is better than throwing our hands up in

819
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:55,329
the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say make something up on</font>

820
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,339
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own so that's why we're at least</font>

821
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:59,140
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this written down and get</font>

822
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:02,470
some feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group so</font>

823
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:05,710
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have stuff to discuss with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

824
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:07,328
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various banks and other other</font>

825
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,809
folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move forward</font>

826
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:12,640
with mutual TLS before token binding or

827
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:14,049
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not interested in token binding</font>

828
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,368
at all because they're really just

829
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:18,759
interested in server to server

830
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:21,130
interactions jaundice is related to this

831
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:23,799
payment service directive that came out

832
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:27,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lisa come it's it's related to both the</font>

833
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:28,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">PSD to and to the open banking</font>

834
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:33,880
regulations which are related but not

835
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:36,730
exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so there are the open</font>

836
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,009
banking consortium in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK was created</font>

837
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,980
as a result of UK government regulations

838
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:44,499
around opening an opening up banking API

839
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,180
is in the same way that PSD to is except

840
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:48,220
that they have a deadline of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

841
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:53,078
this year for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major eight banks to</font>

842
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:54,999
actually have Oh off<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP is opened up so</font>

843
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,190
they are under<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tight time line so</font>

844
00:42:54,999 --> 00:43:01,569
telling them we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to you in a</font>

845
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:08,890
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so is also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a walk isn't making</font>

846
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:11,859
them happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Tony Madeline so we you</font>

847
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:14,618
know we tried to wait for token binding

848
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:19,239
off so but we've had to implement some

849
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:20,799
stopgap measures in between and but it

850
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:24,299
is different than what you guys have

851
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:27,069
done here so you know i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

852
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:31,720
the current draft would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way</font>

853
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:33,670
that I would approach this there's other

854
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,399
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would probably want</font>

855
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to consider if we we needed to take on</font>

856
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,400
this working item can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you</font>

857
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:46,569
explain on what you did Donny I once we

858
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,190
get once if we accept this as a as an

859
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:51,579
effort will submit what

860
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:55,240
we've done is our stopgap measure and in

861
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:56,950
the year that'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great we would be</font>

862
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,529
more than happy to take your input

863
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:02,470
because but this at least kicks the ball

864
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,720
off so that we can pry whatever thing

865
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,490
that is of course totally interoperable

866
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,189
that you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in secret out of you so</font>

867
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:22,899
that the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us can interoperate on</font>

868
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:25,270
it Brian Campbell pain I did read I

869
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,040
think oh one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us this morning before</font>

870
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:30,700
you push three more revisions so I'm not

871
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how up to date it is ah but in my</font>

872
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,710
opinion there's way too many options in

873
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,560
this and hearing the use cases that it's

874
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,390
driven out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is neutral TLS for</font>

875
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,520
these banks so they don't go off and do

876
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,750
something else and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the problem</font>

877
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,670
we're trying to solve we should solve

878
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:49,480
that problem which would mean getting

879
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:52,900
rid of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> j-pop part of it the the</font>

00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,609
nonce<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge-response signature it</font>

881
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,400
was me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do away with</font>

882
00:44:54,609 --> 00:45:00,098
a number of the the confirmation methods

883
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,170
around mutual TLS that either aren't

884
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:04,660
applicable in some cases or introduce a

885
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:08,230
lot of complexity on the resource side

886
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,390
like the the jku method would that that

887
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,220
complexity belongs at the authorization

888
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:18,160
server layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not not at each of the</font>

889
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:20,740
individual resources of the scanning it

890
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,848
back would be generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think more</font>

891
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,169
appropriate particularly if they're

892
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:28,720
tight timelines here whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's worth</font>

893
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,069
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay every Christian so like why</font>

894
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,230
did you why did you put so many

895
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:34,569
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here actually we've</font>

904
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">we should face I agree with Brian that</font>

905
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,210
we should maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one thing</font>

906
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:06,130
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do but unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

907
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,799
actually compare the options get some

input from Microsoft or other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

909
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:15,220
then pare it down to one maybe two ways

910
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:16,869
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it I agree but unless we</font>

911
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually write down what the options are</font>

912
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,880
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss it that's fantastic</font>

913
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,740
unless again if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve a</font>

00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">very specific use case on a tight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

915
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame another approach would be to solve</font>

916
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:31,480
that use case on a tight time frame

917
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:33,220
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of enumerated all possible</font>

918
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,779
options and then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get input</font>

919
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,879
from someone that probably won't give it

920
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:40,660
that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

921
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,640
slow down the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I'm</font>

922
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,960
suggesting is that this approach likely

923
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,069
will not get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the results you want</font>

924
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,170
you will have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> document that we're</font>

925
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about what options should be</font>

926
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,890
client ID or this type of confirmation

927
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,390
method in two years having the same

928
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,740
conversations after the banks have

929
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:58,629
already deployed whatever it is they're

930
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be point I'm okay with</font>

931
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,500
stripping it down or doing it is

932
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,619
multiple documents but we of course

933
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:18,279
always get the criticism of having too

934
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:22,420
many documents in D friendly bear sign

935
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:25,599
um I represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company and several</font>

936
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,520
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT consortiums and what I should</font>

937
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk a little less yeah that's a girl so</font>

938
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:36,549
it is it stupid nice been on my back

939
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:38,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so um anyway um well that's what</font>

940
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:39,609
I'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of a new to this</font>

941
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,589
group I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching the mailing</font>

942
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:44,410
list I'm seeing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

943
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:47,078
convergence on what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

944
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:52,779
high level perspective is going to

945
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:54,700
cryptographic groups of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust in what</font>

946
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:57,849
you're doing whether the clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

947
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:01,270
authorization authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

948
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:04,180
know like this groups and focus on like

949
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,369
interactive authentication and

950
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,440
authorization<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the open ID with the</font>

951
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:11,260
authentication and I think you really

952
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,270
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look from my perspective at</font>

953
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,470
what's happening out there with other

954
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,680
groups as far as

955
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:21,399
out there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt a graphic proofs of</font>

956
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,740
identity for devices and the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> buddy</font>

957
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to me about that later I'm</font>

958
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:29,709
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a convergence and you guys I</font>

959
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,690
think need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide if you really want</font>

960
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,230
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world because there are</font>

961
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:36,849
other approaches being considered which

962
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:42,190
other groups do you have in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

963
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:44,560
particular well I took part in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

964
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,960
industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet consortium in what</font>

965
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going they all seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance</font>

966
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,109
and you know in what they were doing and

967
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,300
plus our company investigated this for

968
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:58,569
about a year with an initiative that we

969
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:01,060
had internally so um yeah I'd love to

970
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to some people about it but I see</font>

971
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:07,330
some convergence and I see you moving

972
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:10,390
toward cryptographic approaches but you

973
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:12,700
also have all this legacy way of doing

974
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:16,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything through the user agent using</font>

975
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,640
redirect yeah i think there's also you

976
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,770
may be interested in the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

977
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing in ace I don't know if you think</font>

978
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that group are earlier today where we</font>

979
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">are using OAuth specifically for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font>

980
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,940
use case where we are not always

981
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:35,680
involving the user quite naturally so I

982
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if you aware of that effort</font>

983
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,200
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to some pointers this</font>

984
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,400
doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything any impact or</font>

985
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,618
relationship with the user

986
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,170
authentication this is about device

987
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:48,910
authentication where Goldman Sachs is

988
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,609
using a certificate to authenticate

989
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,440
itself to Barclays and they want to make

990
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:56,410
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the tokens that are issued are</font>

actually presented by goldman sachs take

992

that book yeah that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

993
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why you need to consider whether</font>

994
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:04,900
you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

995
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the use case but a lot of the IOT</font>

996
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,640
guys are pursuing that exact no user

interaction pure cryptographic proof and

<font color="#CCCCCC">versus interactive you know verification</font>

999
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,849
where it's come from in the past there's

1000

interactive user consent and

1001
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:27,099
verification of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user in issuing the</font>

1002
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:28,420
token the question is wielding the token

1003
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,820
and it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1004
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,380
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with you as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1005
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,390
that the large financial institutions

1006
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,010
seem to have their own opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1007
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:38,140
question is how do we keep them from

1008
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,940
shooting themselves in the foot by some

1009
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,759
rather creative things I've seen them

1010
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,350
for Moses yeah I work on Wall Street for

1011
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:53,650
quite a while so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll fine</font>

1012
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs anyway come back I bet</font>

1013
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:59,410
this is awesome um a lot of questions

1014
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,120
pop up in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind where I'm standing in</font>

1015
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,500
the line first of all can you really

1016
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,069
nail down the use case you want to

1017
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,380
address can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really give us a</font>

1018
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:13,300
statement nail down the use case you

1019
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:19,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dress can you do that please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John</font>

1020
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:21,580
where do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start speaking Jonas Jonas</font>

1021
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,080
coming from me so you want me to stay

1022
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">till</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ya there would you ask what's the</font>

1023
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:29,730
use case so the use case we have at hand

1024
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:35,220
is most urgent one is that the the

1025
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">bank's wants to set up their own CA and</font>

1026
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:42,399
they won't issue that certificates to

1027
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,649
the FinTech companies and they want the

1028
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">FinTech companies to use that</font>

1029
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:53,620
certificate to authenticate their client

1030
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:56,230
to the authorization server and time

1031
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,630
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is not the use case you</font>

1032
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">drag and I dry that client</font>

1033
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:04,240
authentication to the token<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1034
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,040
which first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all means that there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1035
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,020
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between Brian's draft on</font>

1036
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,850
TLS authentication towards the

1037
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,259
authorization so on eventually right

1038
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:16,299
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sir Brian's draw</font>

1039
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,350
thousands town is the clientele of

1040
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:27,010
application for the token and point<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font>

1041
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:29,500
s'okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kinda so to</font>

1042
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:33,250
embed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information about</font>

1043
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:35,380
certificate in this case TN we need the

1044
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,050
information from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that</font>

1045
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,910
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable to me I i would i</font>

1046
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:42,010
would suggest to either put both<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

1047
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,279
the same draft also really explicit

1048
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:46,900
these

1049
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship arm so if this is the</font>

1050
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:55,420
use case why do we need for confirmation

1051
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:58,690
methods I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think I sort of</font>

1052
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:01,330
understand it because um the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1053
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:04,810
explore the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> space and then let</font>

1054
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:07,750
the group pick one and go with that one

1055
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:14,170
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also strongly advised to go with</font>

1056
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:16,150
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly one method John Bradley</font>

1057
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:18,640
again so the feedback that I've gotten

1058
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,100
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks is all they really care</font>

1059
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,509
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that distinguished name they</font>

1060
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,210
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually care about any of the</font>

1061
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:27,100
other confirmation methods but coming

1062
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">before this group and saying oh look</font>

1063
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,920
aren't we smart we're going to use

1064
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:33,460
distinguished names for uniquely

1065
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,850
identity identifying things I can expect

1066
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:41,380
some number of people to have so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

1067
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:44,589
provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> some alternatives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I</font>

1068
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:46,330
feel so dirty recommending using

1069
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:51,070
distinguished names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way and</font>

1070
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:53,230
there are certainly flaws that in this

1071
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:56,680
process and scalability issues that will

1072
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:59,080
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> documented you know if you</font>

1073
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,549
change if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had multiple cas all using</font>

1074
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,490
distinguished names you'd have

1075
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:05,380
differences and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Content</font>

1076
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,120
analyzation process there's all sorts of

1077
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this could go wrong but if</font>

1078
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,819
you have one CA that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue</font>

1079
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,930
certificates to these entities where

1080
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:20,020
there isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a unique common name etc</font>

1081
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:22,060
then using it the string that you

1082
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:26,080
produce out of distinguished name kind

1083
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:27,610
of works if you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so what the</font>

1084
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:33,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">banks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is issue a certificate</font>

1085
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:35,890
to Goldman Sachs and issue a software

1086
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,590
statement along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that sentence</font>

1087
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:41,109
that says what the distinguished name is

1088
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,910
and then have Goldman Sachs go around to

1089
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,940
all the other banks and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1090
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:48,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that software statement to register and</font>

1091
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:50,890
all of the actual transactions the

1092
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:53,020
client authentication and token

1093
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,690
presentments all have to be done over

1094
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,930
TLS channels

1095
00:54:54,690 --> 00:55:01,119
contain the distinguished name that that

1096
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,799
the central banking authority put in the

1097
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,839
original software statement so they want

1098
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:09,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine wat dynamic client</font>

1101
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:32,440
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that the last questions a</font>

1102
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,359
last question is the more about the role

1103
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the of this group in this whole</font>

1104
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:41,619
activity I mean having been or having

1105
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:44,589
tried to chair a working group at

1106
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:47,290
another standardization body which tries

1107
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:50,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a another industrial</font>

1108
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:53,700
initiative with the protocol and<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

1109
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">amber pinning my question is are we</font>

1110
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,410
supposed to provide this banking

1111
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,629
initiative on time of all the ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1112
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:05,560
protocols and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap is that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can a</font>

1113
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:08,109
complete accomplish their goal I think

1114
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,720
we will fail because if they want to

1115
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:13,140
deploy something this year they have to

1116
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,700
build a software within the next month

1117
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:19,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't be able to provide</font>

1118
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:21,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">them with a specification and in this</font>

1119
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:27,220
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame so what's what's our role in</font>

1120
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:29,470
this game well at least we should be

1121
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:32,680
able to give some kind of guidance in

1122
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:36,209
general guidance as group it won't be a

1123
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:40,000
finish to think but instead of you know

1124
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:44,560
letting them do some random<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

1125
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,790
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I think I</font>

1126
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,589
think sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some of the working</font>

1127
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,839
group members can consult them it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1128
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">help them and give them advice but we as</font>

1129
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:55,420
a working group do not run on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a timeline</font>

1130
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:57,098
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a project plan right I think</font>

1131
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,450
that's that's that's a real problem it's

1132
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:00,450
a real issue I'm really

1133
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:05,230
[Music]

1134
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,390
so I'm I'm not so crazy is to suggest

1135
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:11,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have an RFC by the end of</font>

1136
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:14,650
the year or even maybe by the end of the

1137
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">following year no an appointment track</font>

1138
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">record but having something that that</font>

1139
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:23,920
they can at least point to and as a

1140
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:27,550
working group draft actually helps them

1141
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,140
significantly because that's just the

1142
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:32,710

process works if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something in a</font>

standards body it's easier for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1145
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,480
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss it because it's not</font>

coming from a single vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I hear</font>

00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,320
the words this is tossing again<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">worst case that can happen is that in a</font>

1149
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,550
year time frame we have a we haven't

1150
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:53,320
draft which describes something it's

1151
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:56,410
being implemented several places and

1152
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:59,230
afterwards every every proposal for a

1153
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,759
change is answered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> no this is already</font>

1154
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:05,080
implemented and deployed we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

1155
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:11,620
that and I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the too often so I am</font>

1156
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:14,080
saying concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lynch and SRC a plus-12</font>

1157
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:16,569
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> torsten just said the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

1158
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,340
putting a draft out so that you have

1159
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for a conversational point</font>

1160
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,360
with people who are in a fast

1161
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,310
implementation process when you know

1162
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,250
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have completed or</font>

1163
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">dependable work makes me even more</font>

1164
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:31,570
concerned about the scope of the

1165
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,130
document and the number of options as

1166
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:35,470
opposed to the single use case that

1167
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:37,030
you're addressing the only positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1168
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,790
see out of this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would get</font>

1169
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,950
additional potential solutions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1170
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,900
tables in stone said they would submit

1171
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:47,919
immediately but then you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts</font>

1172
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:50,620
for reference so just saying but on the

1173
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,130
other hand I also think it's good if

1174
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:56,890
they are consumers who want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS</font>

1175
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:58,330
and actually reach out to yours working

1176
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:00,160
group in some sense that's a positive

1177
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,960
thing you know like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

1178
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,089
randomly do things they actually come to

1179
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:08,500
us because they believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can work</font>

1180
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this out with all the caveats that are</font>

1181
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,540
good idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

1182
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,950
questioned by some first of all we are

1183
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,470
running out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and second who has</font>

1184
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:20,020
read the document not the one that NAT

1185
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:25,330
submitted today but some other some

1186
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:28,060
version yeah so maybe we can sort of

1187
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:29,920
find some some reviewers and get that

1188
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,630
discussion going I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's the best</font>

1189
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,640
that we can do at that time you see a

1190
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:40,960
