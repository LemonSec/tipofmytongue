working group last call and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

60
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,680
sent on for publication so many thanks

who's reviewed it and done

63
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:38,820
implementation on CT DNS SEC we have no

64
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:44,200
no update on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and at is they're</font>

65
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:47,770
interested in moving this forward yes

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,320
okay well as usual the way to do to do

67
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,659
that is to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts to submit new</font>

68
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,510
ones on CT binaries there's new

69
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,980
interested in picking this up um and and

70
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Frank has a draft that he'll be talking</font>

71
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,150
about later in addition my understanding

72
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:05,620
is that there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some movement on</font>

73
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,900
this outside of the IETF I and EKG can

74
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,580
probably speak to that but um we would

75
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:15,130
like an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it when we're talking</font>

76
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,289
about that topic so and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reminder this</font>

77
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,450
is this is a big deal I in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

78
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,240
moving the document along 69-62 this

79
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,880
needs to be correct but it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not need</font>

80
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,500
to be complete we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we can</font>

81
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,750
always publish additional documents

82
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,980
providing explanation additional

83
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:36,400
features and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so with that</font>

84
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:41,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on to the status update from</font>

87
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:15,650
ones are these that's not it that's not

88

89
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:35,659
your yeah yeah okay all right as a

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,340
reminded the way to minimize the

91
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,310
likelihood of this happening is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

92
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:52,820
them get slides two chairs before the

93
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:54,740
day of the meeting ok so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

94
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,930

when preparing this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the slides</font>

96
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,450
for my TF 91 with updates about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cigna</font>

97

<font color="#E5E5E5">6th abyss and I really really hope that</font>

98
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,560
I won't be standing here again like in

99
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:12,350
half a year and giving like another

100
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:15,410
update but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very confident but I'm</font>

101
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,140
very confident that that I want me not

102
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,570
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> why so after World Cup last</font>

103
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,700
call we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get we've got a significant</font>

104
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,070
fidic from New Zealand who took took

105
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,950
like a very thorough look at the airport

106
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the system design overall and try</font>

107
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,890
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use like basically provide different</font>

108
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,720
perspective on how city can be built or

109
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,610
implemented such that it can give like

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">stronger by Ortiz to clients and</font>

111
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally the bits in 66 to this that</font>

112
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,630
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unfriendly to clients or</font>

113
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,280
implement servers in general the

114
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,740
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls roughly into one of these</font>

115
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,600
four categories which which art has

116
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,850
hopefully filed like in the issue

117
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,140
tracker and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent some time trashing</font>

118
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,580
them all most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them with him it</font>

119
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,560
doesn't sort but like to the issues

120
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,410
right now currently include like the

121
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow up but they will like</font>

122
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,810
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ITF meeting and then what</font>

123
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,359
I'll do I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go over them I'm</font>

124
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,489
present so for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that for I think</font>

125
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,940
almost all the issues we have an

126
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,860
agreement on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the suggested the</font>

127
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,269
recommended changes which we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

128
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,949
back again to the world group for

129
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,720
approval to make sure we have consensus

130
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:27,579
on them there are a few that we do we on

131
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,069
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also bring to the world group</font>

132
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:31,899
like for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion but mostly what</font>

133
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,209
I'm going to describe now is things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

134
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,740
is other issues what what was this of

135
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:39,008
the original intention behind each of

136
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,569
those and how do we propose to resolve

137
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,680
that so that on that editorial front

138
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:47,290
there was description<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the log</font>

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,939
parameters specifically the log metadata

140
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,279
section that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was either think relatively</font>

141
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:54,129
late in the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the suggestion</font>

142
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839

143
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,810
the beginning of the document where we

144
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,600
describe an actual log operation we have

145
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,399
the extension types defined for sats in

146
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,189
the stages these are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

147
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,170
separate extension types the suggestion

148
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:11,469
was to merge them to a single extension

149
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,800
type because right now no extensor

150
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,529
define it seemed sensible to me we use

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,990
the digitally signed notation to

152
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:23,680
describe what the signatures in six and

153
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bees are over and the suggestion</font>

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,939
was to use the description from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

155
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">tailless 13 spec but like retain the</font>

156
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,880
encoding of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure is it</font>

157
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">including the signature and hash</font>

158
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,410
algorithms even though this is metadata

159
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,850
that the client should know about the

160
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,389
log because the client already knows the

161
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,459
logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> public key just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it simply</font>

162
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,399
simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement you can just chill</font>

163
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:51,219
out to the underlying crypto library

164
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,319
function for decoding that better

165
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,839
explanations specifically about how to

166
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,449
construct a leaf hash from the

167

certificate in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city and then by the</font>

168

description on how to validate nst so

169
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,758
the steps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are needed water like the</font>

170
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,740
data structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs to be</font>

171
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,649
reconstructed and how it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be how it</font>

172
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,439
should be validated which are again<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

173
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,089
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of implied in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spec but I think</font>

174
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,349
a better explanation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually</font>

175
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,820
make it simpler to implement because we

176
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,420
have seen people

177
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,770
both for 60 and 62 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base</font>

178
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:26,949
somewhat struggling to to do that

179
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:29,530
correctly I think so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far more editorial</font>

180
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,690
staff so the of the miracle tree data

181
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,780
formats the data structures that are

182
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually used like stored in the tree</font>

183
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're spread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all over should probably</font>

184
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,130
be consolidated and grouped into one

185
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,880
section or taste a few sections one

186
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,620
after yet one after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other a great I</font>

187
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,270
would say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bike-sharing opportunity</font>

188
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,030
is the notation for the miracle tree

189
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,040
section how do you denote like the tree

190
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,550
of a given size or an entry at this

191
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,010
index I think when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robin I tried finding</font>

192
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,520
like standard notations we couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

193
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:07,030
any so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has suggestion do let</font>

194
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,770
us know there was there is a section

195
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,720
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all codes so some error codes are</font>

196
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,949
common some error codes are specific to

197
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,080
a 1 like 1 IP a function call and the

198
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,520
suggestion there was to clarify exactly

199
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,710
what are the common ones and say like

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,430
there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse of error codes beyond</font>

201
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,710
the common ones so each if an error code

202
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:30,819
repeats in some but not all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API</font>

203
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,100
of them hcp cause then for for each of

204
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,220
these calls that does that may return it

205
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,410
will specify there and then the

206
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,400
definition of incorporate like what does

207
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:45,520
that mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our for submission the</font>

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,110
certificate to be incorporated<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

209
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,280
that's Richard parts i think that's a

210
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,160
little different than what I thought we

211
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,189
discussed yesterday um I was thinking

212
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,709
that incorporate an entry would be

213
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:00,850
incorporated into a log when a sign tree

214
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">had exists that covers that entry yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

215
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,570
so that's that's why agree yes I think

216
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">we should just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like clarify that yeah I</font>

217
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,770
think that's a little more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> its rail</font>

218
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,680
is that that semantically sound correct

219
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:17,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in the room looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

220
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,550
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's nodding because well well no</font>

221
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,380
I mean it's meaningful right because

222
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's that's how you interpret the MMD</font>

223
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:27,430
right right so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

224
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,380
like an actual definition for this what

225
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">to but you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the MMD is a delta</font>

226
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,660
between

227
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,209
to events like what's the incorporation

228
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,980
event so it was like defining that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

229
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,508
the time step of sth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

230
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,929
issuance when sth seemed like an

231
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:43,389
appropriate thing to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

232
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,649
language is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for the record yeah I</font>

233
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,179
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's what I guess what</font>

234
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,600
triggered this this issue in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

235
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:51,660
place it's not entirely clear but

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,040
broadly speaking I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a log entry</font>

237
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,049
can't really exist unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like</font>

238
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,079
what it can exist without having like an

239
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:01,540
sth covering it but clients see that it

240
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:06,549
exists one stage covering it is

241
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">published so we'll do that data</font>

242
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">structures so the few data structures</font>

243
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,790
we've specified that I think we can like

244
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,759
simplifies 11 was the suggestion to get

245
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,670
rid of the SCT with proof data be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

246
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,610
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I named the trolls of the</font>

247
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:27,939
time very easily obviously that was more

248
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,189
useful when we thought that will support

249
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:31,959
reduction either by allowing logging of

250
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:34,059
intermediate certificates and then

251
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">having one data structure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that contains</font>

252
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:38,769
like the ICT they proved sth for this

253
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,389
intermediate embedded in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there or</font>

254
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,509
medicine where else would have made more

255
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:45,790
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like strictly</font>

256
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,670
necessary it just means that client but

257
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:52,540
clients will just have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

258
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:56,049
which initial inclusion proof and sth

259
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,660
whether they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of belong to removal</font>

260
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,480
of the time stem from the st<font color="#E5E5E5"> ages so</font>

261
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,189
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually i think it's a good</font>

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,339
ticket because it's sort of exposed like

263
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:08,649
some underlying assumption so you do

264
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,139
need the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp in the sth to</font>

265
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,819
basically show that the log has up like

266
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,339
has upheld like the maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> urged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elaine</font>

267
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:17,319
to show that indeed the certificate luck

268
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,490
or submission was incorporated within a

269
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:23,110
given time period but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

270
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,269
the sth is a proof of liveliness from

271
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,249
the log then it becomes more tricky

272
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:30,009
because nothing so like you can call i

273
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:32,679
get sth analog and get in a stage that's

274
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:36,009
eight hours old what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say about</font>

275
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the log I don't know so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think and I</font>

276
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,399
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an actual issue that came</font>

277
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:43,870
up i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we monitored one of the</font>

278
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:46,540
recent one on one log which incorporates

279
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,550
so decades and did so within the MMD but

280
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,620
we weren't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> observe the sth that</font>

the chose they were incorporated until

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,330
several hours later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,600
are date these are data structures for

288
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,490
staff returned by the gate increase call

289
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> general I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensible</font>

290
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,290
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that whatever is returned</font>

291
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,839
by the gate entry school is the same

292
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,900
format that was submitted in the ED

293
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,450
chain method just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are clear</font>

294
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,980
here i want to remind folks that even

295
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,830
though the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these struts says</font>

296
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,240
entry it's not actually destruct that is

297
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,100
recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the entry in the log there's</font>

298
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,900
a different TLS structures also has

299
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,930
entry in name so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things</font>

300
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:41,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are returned in the get entries as</font>

301
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,729
metadata about the actual entry yeah and

302
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'll is</font>

303
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,450
part of the editorial work i'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

304
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,609
clean it up and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the data</font>

305
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,370
structure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has entering the name is</font>

306
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,240
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is in the log like is the</font>

307
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,130
log entry and not and not something else

308
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,080
and the next one was about indication of

309
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,110
certificate / certificate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entry</font>

310
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nset so right now we have the trans</font>

311
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,329
item which can embed all the other data

312
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,030
structures in a document and this part

313
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,829
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type in the trans item there is</font>

314
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,329
an indication of whether this the trans

315
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,399
item contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the necessity for put</font>

316
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,559
certificate or<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessity for next 5 a-9</font>

317
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,900
certificate and the suggestion here was

318
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move that indication into the city</font>

319
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,500
and not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two separate transaction</font>

320
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:28,179
types for these two cities which i think

321
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,059
is sensible we'll just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

322
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,000
that there are no implications beyond

323
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:37,090
that because well that I think logically

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,920
means it when that's implemented the SCT

325
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,840
stock gets passed around whether the

326
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,610
trans item<font color="#CCCCCC"> struck so it's clear exactly</font>

327
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,559
what's being passed around and yet the

328
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,600
indication of whether it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> present of</font>

329
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kansas City or an x.509 certificate</font>

330
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,780
icity you still kept in the data

331
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,129
structuring doesn't to be passed along

332
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,660
so one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's nice about</font>

333
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,820
this proposed changes that it makes it a

334
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,010
little cleaner too

335
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,659
different entry types in the future

336
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,690
because you can just increment you add

337
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in elements the entry type struct what I</font>

338
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,470
already indicate the entry type in the

339
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,830
SCT as opposed to having been you

340
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,690
translate inside yes yeah it's a roughly

341
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,100
the same number of octet but its<font color="#E5E5E5"> native</font>

342
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">bill it's a little bit cleaner another</font>

343
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:24,010
arranged yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so common</font>

344
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:27,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">thread is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP or like the API in</font>

345
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:32,230
general we had a few calls where we've

346
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:36,070
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sth is an output</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parameter in</font>

347
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,360
case the the log doesn't know about the

348
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,220
tree size that the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> is crowing</font>

349
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,899
about so for example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client asks</font>

350
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,090
for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> sth possess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> approved between two</font>

351
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,890
three sizes but that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font>

352
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,080
end of the log knows about only knows

353
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,700
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smaller precise because they</font>

354
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,149
didn't like that front and didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

355
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,160
see the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one then that front end</font>

356
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,620
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> return a consistency proof between</font>

357
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,110
the sth the client requested and sth the

358
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,610
latest stage it knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and the</font>

359
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,120
lightest<font color="#CCCCCC"> st agent knows about so the</font>

360
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,899
client can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of have a smaller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delta</font>

361
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,010
to check consistency for but it actually

362
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,340
complicates the client implementation

363
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,070
and the benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think isn't entirely</font>

364
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,629
clear so because that's something that

365
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,129
the client can do themselves right like

366
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,840
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get they can just like</font>

367
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:25,270
retry so these were these suggestions to

368
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,679
remove the sth from from these missed

369
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,290
calls and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben Lori indicated</font>

370
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,850
that he made it more convincing about

371
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">those so I guess there will be like a</font>

372
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,780
discussion on the list consolidation of

373
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,850
the two separate endpoints which like

374
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,430
this just like two separate luck HTTP

375
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,719
calls right now or<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods and there is</font>

376
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,070
already like a different parameter that

377
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,660
says if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty certificate or so</font>

378
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,270
difficult being submitted so I think

379
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's very sensible the last one about</font>

380
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,280
the best when practice is 190 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

381
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,560
think as far as I understand says you

382
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,030
should advertise the your eyes in the

383
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,960
directory so there is like one endpoint

384
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:05,350
the client for is to get directory

385
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,500
design is which each service what the

386
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the was right here all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

387
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it is not</font>

388
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,610
lickable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for six and six degrees because</font>

389
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,020
the client already has a decent amount

390
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,809
of metadata about the look like the

391
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,110
contest to know like the looks URL the

392
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:23,139
key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of other parameters so</font>

393
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:28,219
service discovery i think is is of

394
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:31,179
limited utility in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> thompson I</font>

395
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,010
think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> raised this originally now I</font>

396
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:37,309
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interpreting the app</font>

397
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:43,790
basically one not in a very pessimistic

398
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:46,970
way so a potential way to interpret 190

399
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,080
is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have configuration</font>

400
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,000
for each one of these endpoints that

401
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,830
you've described that would work

402
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,429
perfectly well you could say simply say

403
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:59,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the configuration is required to</font>

404
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:02,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify all of the different your eyes</font>

405
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are used there's like five of them</font>

406
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,530
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that yeah get away</font>

407
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,659
with that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

408
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,600
worry about basically 190 the way the

409
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:16,940
document is currently structured it says

410
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:20,299
/ trans / v 1 is or p2 is a particular

411
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,130
thing and that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people operating</font>

412
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,950
these servers that they have to put

413
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,650
these resources in those locations and

414
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,179
that's massively inconvenient for that

415
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,010
could be massively inconvenient for some

416
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,390
people obviously it's not particularly

417
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,740
inconvenient for those people who have

418
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,690
already implemented it because they

419
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,640
don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care but you're</font>

420
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,950
constraining the way that someone

421
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,040
implements and deploys their service in

422
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,890
a way that is unnecessary and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

423
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,240
simply say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the configuration that a</font>

424
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,980
client needs to know about a particular

425
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">log encompasses now a small set of your</font>

426
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,549
eyes you completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

427
00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:01,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems with basically 190 and you</font>

428
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:03,559
ideally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a better outcome as well so</font>

429
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">either do suggest that the like</font>

430
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,210
specifically having to ask like the

431
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:11,540
resources to be put under<font color="#CCCCCC"> ctv too is</font>

432
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,140
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problem I very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

433
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,879
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so and they've the</font>

434
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,890
resistance of doing a directory which is

435
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,750
what a number of other protocols do is

436
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,910
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that extra level of interaction</font>

437
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,720
means that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extra latency</font>

438
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,799
involved with

439
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,190
using that love you know I don't

440
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,110
actually subscribe to that notion

441
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,690
particularly well because caching and

442
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:36,469
various other things and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

443
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:39,919
lot of extra latency anyway but if that

444
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,049
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a concern then you can simply take</font>

445
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,380
the other part that I suggested<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

446
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:48,049
yeah it's sort taking my half I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

447
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,030
fan of bcp 190 in general I mean this

448
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:52,039
you know I this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a web application</font>

449
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,840
I'm not concerned about namespace

450
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,179
collisions I am concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about latency</font>

451
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,860
but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand I don't feel that</font>

452
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">strongly about it I mean it's about it</font>

453
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,990
you know it's you said it's massively

454
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,820
inconvenient I think it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

455
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of subjective view of this one that</font>

456
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,820
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and what basically 190</font>

457
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,820
says is don't say things about other

458
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,158
people's spaces that you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

459
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,309
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to in this case now</font>

460
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,100
I've offered to two solutions one of

461
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,379
which you push back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fair the other</font>

462
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,760
one I think would probably work out yeah

463
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,080
as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues like that</font>

464
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,669
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel really strongly about</font>

465
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,939
this i don't i don't love it but it's

466
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:33,620
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big a deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i I think PCP 190 is</font>

467
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,130
not something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel strong about aa</font>

468
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:40,039
little pushback really<font color="#CCCCCC"> got on on its on</font>

469
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the general concept but okay we've got</font>

470
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,870
somebody remote I'm gonna hit the button

471
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,120
and see if this works Andrew hi Andrew

472
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,899
airfare speaking as a client

473
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,090
implementing life the clap doing what

474
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,419
Martin suggests would impose a lot of

475
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:59,510
burden on us and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

476
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:02,330
would have long said changes the URLs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

477
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,600
uses how does how does the log you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

478
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,549
notify monitors auditors people

479
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,590
participate participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in gossip that</font>

480
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,389
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a different URLs so</font>

481
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,189
this creates you know whole host of

482
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,070
policy problems in the monitoring

483
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,929
ecosystem and it just it doesn't really

484
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,168
seem like it's difficult for server

485
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:23,840
operator to have to know use not

486
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:27,559
particular sub pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

487
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,689
underneath they a root URL so I'd be in

488
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:34,549
favor of just keeping things as they are

489
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:37,400
right now yeah so so my response to that

490
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:39,260
would be um if it hurts

491
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,690
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can't imagine someone</font>

492
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,670
who's deployed a public blog that has

493
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,670
numerous people depending on them is

494
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:51,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change where things can be</font>

495
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:52,730
accessed but I just ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

496
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:57,590
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know why you would</font>

497
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:59,660
suggested that that would happen alimony

498
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,189
Google's so you're right this is

499
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,510
subjective and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only kind of like</font>

500
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,010
way things but my view is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

501
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:09,800
complexity for no reason because of

502
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:12,230
google my opinion is that from practical

503
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,270
standpoint is there no log implementers

504
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,050
for requesting it we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do it</font>

505
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:20,750
and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 190 ideological purity</font>

operational experience with CT now

519
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,000
nobody has said it hurts maybe we

520
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,490
continue to believe it doesn't hurt and

521
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,940
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know fix our bcp compliance</font>

later if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're can extend the protocol</font>

523
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,060
to add some discovery mechanism if it

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:11,360
turns out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a server</font>

525
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:15,500
Kate was so intent on I'll definitely

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,530
follow up on that later<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

additions are the one of them was a long

531
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,760
separation for ICT and sth keys so I

532
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,909
mean now like general like in theory the

533
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,490
as far as I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol</font>

534
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,690
doesn't really require like using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

535
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,790
same key and you can definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

536
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,930
different keys for verifying OCT one

537
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:46,790
lender if Angus the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edges we couldn't</font>

538
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,250
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a clear benefit to doing that</font>

539
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,110
because like the way logs like<font color="#CCCCCC"> City logs</font>

540
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,570
are implemented right now as distributed

541
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,159
Systems means the front and jobs the

542
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,620
ones that actually need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign like an</font>

issue a city's get moved around between

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,270
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> same centers so it's not like they</font>

545
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,950
are tied to a specific a gsm and and

546
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,750
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the signer sequencer jobs</font>

547
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,150
the ones that actually generate and grow

548

the tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> also move around between data</font>

549
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,850
centers again because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want like</font>

550
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,600
a single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failure so they are</font>

551
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,250
not tied doing hsm<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so like the</font>

552
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no like a benefit to</font>

553
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,650
isolating one key but not the other so

554
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,530
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should we can describe</font>

555
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,210
and say that it can be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> but probably</font>

556
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:33,320
in the security considerations say why

557
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:34,700
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be done this feels a</font>

558
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
little bit like saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're</font>

559
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,090
worried about sharing he's around is a

560
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,299
big deal because everyone sharing keys

561
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,639
around already um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still feel like</font>

562
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little sketchy about making that</font>

563
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,110
assumption into the into the protocol

564
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,720
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm okay like letting this be for</font>

565
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,879
now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems like again if we</font>

566
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,440
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address this concern later if we</font>

569
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,120
that more we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> extend with some</font>

mechanisms to delegate authority for

some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system to separate key</font>

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,110
in and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this</font>

573
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,820
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like maybe</font>

574
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,520
like a better way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it would be to</font>

575
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,559
say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys for cities and st</font>

576
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,299
agencies shame share the same properties

577
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,428
i mean i agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't want them</font>

578
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,710
like these keys like distributed like to

579
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:23,120
idly and you want to like keep careful

580
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,330
keep track of how they're on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

581
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,790
being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> but separating them is like</font>

582
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,199
maybe not beneficial because they sort

583
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:34,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ultimately dissolution the same</font>

584
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:37,549
properties ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then removing</font>

585
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,320
unnecessary restrictions on logs so

586
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,000
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two restrictions that were</font>

587
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,280
mentioned in this ticket one of them is

588
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,960
about not imposing any conditions on

589
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,500
retrieving or sharing data from locks

590
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,450
which was is actually like a policy

591
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,260
measure to make sure that data from box

592
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,570
can always be obtained not necessarily

593
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,429
necessary from a standard perspective so

594
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,490
the suggestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to change that must</font>

595
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:03,740
we should such that implementations that

596
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,750
under some circumstances want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font>

597
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,060
data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledged</font>

598
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,790
can do that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the policy for the</font>

599
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,370
user agents for including<font color="#E5E5E5"> these locks</font>

600
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:16,510
could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you actually must allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

601
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:18,489
like an unrestricted access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

602
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,740
that the log stores if you want to be

603
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,650
included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the user agent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I shape which</font>

604
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,200
i think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in simple that one</font>

605
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,420
was about verifying that the submitted

606
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">set has a valid signature chained to the</font>

607
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,130
two accepted process anchor and that is

608
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,710
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there most like for spam protection</font>

609
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,180
so that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

610
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">from protection and the second one is</font>

611
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 to base the SCT the</font>

612
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,530
signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> audacity covers the TBS</font>

613
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,290
certificate portion of the submission

614
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,980
and the issuer key hush so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that client</font>

615
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,899
sort of that the implication is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

616
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,020
log verified the submission makes sense

617
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,240
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like sign only the</font>

618
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,889
bits that that are interesting in that

619
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,860
perspective it may still be okay to

620
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,240
change the two issued but but at the

621
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,790
very least we should I to explain like

622
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">whites there and why it's like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

623
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,590
the what are the reasons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping in</font>

624
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:17,230
there and yeah maybe change it to shoot

625
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:21,189
i'm not entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure about about that</font>

626
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,840
one incorporating new protocol

627
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,580
mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Utila client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> section so</font>

628
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,080
this was about so the right now

629
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,639
sequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is very heavy on</font>

630
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,740
unless it is right it says like when you

631
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,840
should validate as it is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we</font>

632
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,600
can ship embedded inclusion proofs and

633
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,459
the protocol should say that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

634
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,230
like an embedded inclusion proof and an

635
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sth then you might as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well verify the</font>

636
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,030
whole thing so i think this perspective

637
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:48,850
should also be provided like threaded

638
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:50,649
throughout the document now<font color="#E5E5E5"> two more</font>

639
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,730
issues around architecture one of them

640
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,490
is having the entire stages of story of

641
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,900
the log accessible to clients so similar

642
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,120
to get entries or you can just get all

643
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,220
the entries from the log have guetta

644
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,679
stages and it guided allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

645
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,660
all the stages from the log<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if</font>

646
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,600
you had a signal sequence number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

647
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,450
stages you can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always like know</font>

648
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,610
which like which st edges sort of you

649
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,710
need right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edges you can</font>

650
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,668
request so that i think would simplify

651
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,830
al

652
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:23,109
such like such a method and would still

653
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,470
allow so the importance of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

654
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:27,850
if monitors in particular can download

655
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,429
all of the entries using the attend

656
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,928
trees and keep in mind that each entry

657
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:33,999
contains the timestamp of when it was

658
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,129
incorporated and then can download all

659
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:38,950
the st edges using guetta stages then

660
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:41,230
each monitor can verify that<font color="#CCCCCC"> each entry</font>

661
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,239
was incorporated within the MMD so

662
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,609
having a record<font color="#CCCCCC"> of both is is very</font>

663
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:47,230
useful for investigating actually that

664
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,359
was one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were missing when</font>

665
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:54,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">invade investigating an incident with</font>

666
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:57,129
one of the city logs that was I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

667
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:58,269
should like a stages for entries with

668
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,799
slightly different order which means

669
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,169
basically different<font color="#E5E5E5"> trees and you</font>

670
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,908
couldn't get like the historic st edges

671
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:08,289
to know exactly sort of when that and it

672
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:09,850
started the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one about binding the</font>

673
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,649
set of artifacts the log is expected to

674
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,678
produce we didn't get around to triaging

675
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:16,779
yet which I don't quickly like to

676
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,249
briefly describe the motivation I don't

677
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:21,340
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into it but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

678
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:22,480
perspective will be useful yes you have

679
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,418
eating it to discuss as well because

680
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,179
it's the media story I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

681
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:31,179
here is that right now we you know a log

682
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:34,450
is expected to produce and an inclusion

683
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:37,869
proof but consistency proofs between any

684
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:42,009
two country heads and inclusion proofs

685
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:43,330
from any entry to any tree head and the

686
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:45,730
observation here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that that</font>

687
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,649
latter part introduces an unnecessary

688
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,330
degree of freedom which<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatly expands</font>

689
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,850
the set of artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as expected to</font>

690
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,859
produce which greatly reduces the cash

691
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,769
ability of the system they like cash

692
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:58,928
abilities important both for scalability

693
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:01,299
reasons but also for privacy reasons um

694
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:03,129
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at things like the</font>

695
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:07,480
CT /<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS proposals that have been made</font>

696
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:09,399
those are relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash hits for the</font>

697
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,840
privacy properties they're giving so so

698
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:13,988
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree that we can reduce the</font>

699
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,399
variation in what a log effective

700
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:17,590
produce and what clients are expected to

701
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,320
query<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you get a better cache hit</font>

702
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,539
rate in a better privacy currency so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

703
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,450
think the the upshot on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document for</font>

704
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is probably going to be is I</font>

705
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:30,909
expected what we would get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to say</font>

706
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a log instead of producing being</font>

707
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,330
required to produce

708
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,090
a an included improved from any entry to

709
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:40,090
it to any tree head would be required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

710
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,399
produce an inclusion proof from an entry

711
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,309
to a tree head of its choice and then a

712
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,719
consistency proof from the tree head of

713
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:57,668
its choice to the tree had the client

714
00:33:46,720 --> 00:34:04,269
likes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your assumption is that</font>

715
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:06,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> president the client has some has</font>

716
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,199

cash a bunch of s cts aren't sorry my<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,529

catch one as th you care about getting

737
00:34:52,810 --> 00:35:00,609

746
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,230
the server could say here's an inclusion

747

client doesn't ask about any particular

749
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,118
no it does so the server can say here's

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,710
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inclusion proof up to the sth that</font>

00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,430
you said and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sth</font>

752
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,310

753
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,799
rizal worth it it's not required to but

754
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,170
any existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> log can be trivially</font>

755
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,670
changed to implement this by using that

756
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:49,140
method

757
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:54,280
what right super sets but yeah anyway

758
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:56,529
yes sir richard i guess i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure if</font>

759
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,630
this is in the air out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

760
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda at some</font>

761
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,740
point but at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about</font>

762
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:05,140
the the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are producing this</font>

763
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,569
skip list would like to know which one

764
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lord with like is there some</font>

765
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:12,849
description is there some because that

766
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,619
happens work well on requires that the

767
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:16,869
people produce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people disseminating</font>

768
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:18,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sth is to trust the clients knowing</font>

769
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,780
which one's the law would prefer to

770
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:25,089
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so is that somehow cover here</font>

771
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,720
yeah that's the idea of number 163 here

772
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:32,849
to say there is a list of kind of

773
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,770
blessed<font color="#E5E5E5"> sths so that doesn't address the</font>

774
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:38,170
question of which sth the log would like

775
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,859
for a given certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> forgiving entry</font>

776
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:43,119
um it just it that at least limits the

777
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,770
space to say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the tree heads</font>

778
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,799
you need to care about if you want to

779
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,240
address the history of the law so yeah

780
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,710
if you want to address the make it

781
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,149
predicts what we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> th the log them</font>

782
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,319
like forgiven certificate that would

783
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,869
need something else that's not covered

784
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,609
in this change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

785
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,020
fact that the model<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think people are</font>

786
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:01,900
their heads which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some people have</font>

787
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,430
which is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there's some</font>

788
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,190
mechanism for getting a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blessed</font>

789
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,460
sths which you out of bamboo lemur cool

790
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,440
and um and then you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with</font>

791
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">your the datas mechanism and say please</font>

792
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,940
feed me a proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> after one of those right</font>

793
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just trying to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font>

794
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,720
that has to be how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

795
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,579
efficiently be nice if if you if you

796
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">could create one for love with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lights to</font>

797
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you that was for a heads will be</font>

798
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:29,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">cashing the obvious thing would be to</font>

799
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,149
require you add an additional

800
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,819
requirement here that the sth you use in

801
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,460
your inclusion proof is the proximal sth

802
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:40,509
if the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one that</font>

803
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,760
covers the certificate in question that

804
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,200
seems reasonable to me and probably the

805
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,900
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would implement it are going about</font>

806
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,819
this but um interesting one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

807
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:55,180
thing yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think it's useful to</font>

808
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:56,049
describe these this um the system but

809
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font>

810
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:59,679
which I don't mind like one of the

811
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,859
things I mean for is to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

812
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,199
six and six<font color="#E5E5E5"> TB scan can be used to</font>

813
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:07,420
implement like<font color="#E5E5E5"> City logs with the same</font>

814
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,589
like mindset or same approach that six

815
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six to currently allows you and</font>

816
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:14,109
enable that as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think ideally</font>

817
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,779
the protocol will allow you will have

818
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:19,179
like the knobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 you to do both and</font>

819
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:20,829
then describe that particular approach

820
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:24,009
like how to how to select or how to

821
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:25,779
bless st edges right and then the

822
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:27,369
requirement for for inclusion proof soft

823
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:30,939
up to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these blessed stages and</font>

824
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:33,069
other considerations about cashing in I

825
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:38,229
think it's like documented wheels on top

826
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:41,170
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google so eka I think</font>

827
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:43,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think we need in the protocol to</font>

828
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,539
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like a way to distinguish</font>

829
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:48,819
some subset of tree heads if the clients

830
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:51,009
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for inclusion proofs to the</font>

831
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:53,019
like the closest tree head afterwards

832
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:55,329
then the server just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with caching</font>

833
00:38:53,019 --> 00:39:00,308
and so forth can figure this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

834
00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:02,289
it just should naturally work well I'm

835
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:04,749
if the client has some some subset of

836
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:07,299
heads that it's happy with right and

837
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:10,538
it's it knows like the timestamp of the

838
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:14,709
search but it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and so it</font>

839
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:16,150
says what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next sth along and tell</font>

840
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,828
the ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server like give me a path</font>

841
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just if all the clients</font>

842
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:24,849
do this just with caching<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just works</font>

843
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:26,799
so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure so I guess say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

844
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:32,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it let's assume the sth is our number by</font>

845
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:35,829
integers and so what happens if um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

846
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,979
guess what happens if on firefox decides

847
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:40,959
to do the New York to see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1000 and</font>

848
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:43,598
chrome besides that he'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what 1,000</font>

849
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:47,709
before then we will disagree about those

850
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,819
and you won't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> one right I think yes</font>

851
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,928
and that's correct i think you'll get

852
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,089
most of what you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might have</font>

853
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,109
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones for different clients but</font>

854
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:58,390
you know you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handful</font>

855
00:39:53,109 --> 00:40:01,689
alternatives that might be okay on our

856
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,189
now I guess this maybe I think that the

857
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:05,799
real problem is that what's motivating

858
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:07,899
this from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective is a desire to</font>

859
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:09,520
eventually all the servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feed a</font>

860
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,500
complete inclusion

861
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,810
to clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that every quiet</font>

862
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">houston-base ever accept the same house</font>

863
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,759
it has to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

864
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether that's</font>

865
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,640
really the motivating case which you may

866
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,170
think is a super motivating case but

867
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,950
that's what anybody in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> an s require</font>

868
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:29,290
a group that's quite a substantial thing

869
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:34,180
isn't it having the service send for the

870
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:35,800
proofs to the clients I mean I imagine I

871
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:41,140
agree as possible but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting</font>

872
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,190
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers to do this no no I think it</font>

873
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,120
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coupled with the fetch</font>

874
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,280
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm but there I ain't it the</font>

875
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,109
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are reasons to believe that the</font>

876
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,030
knees mechanism may not provide exactly

877
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,320
what you want in and out friday zakat is

878
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,810
that the properties you want in various

879
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,290
ways and and certainly the performance

880
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:02,940
impacts on if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that of</font>

881
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,940
course about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for the dns mechanism</font>

882
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,110
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think one of the reasons</font>

883
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,390
is this is a this is a hairball

884
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:16,630
discussion because this represents a

885
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:20,290
substantial change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the goals of what</font>

886
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,640
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do here and so it needs</font>

887
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,740
substantial discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am a</font>

888
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,779
little concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

889
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,580
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've laid</font>

890
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,360
sufficient groundwork to be able to take

891
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">a smart discussion to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list I</font>

892
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,330
think we've done that I think what I

893
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,450
might propose I think we've got a

894
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:42,069
separate issue here an additional issue

895
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:44,770
about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it predictable which sthu</font>

896
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,990
would address we're given<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Gentry I</font>

897
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,820
would propose that Iran and I will talk

898
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,560
talk it through will make a PR and we'll

899
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some discussion list okay that'd be</font>

900
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,910
fantastic thank you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of me as</font>

901
00:41:53,020 --> 00:42:00,250
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that I think that's almost</font>

902
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,799
at the end there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two issues which</font>

903
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,920
were on which we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a consensus</font>

904
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,790
I stopped short of putting like photo of

905
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,000
bike in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shed here use of like low</font>

906
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:16,240
godís should use Y Diez or in 32 we and

907
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,700
separately the IDS specified that refer

908
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,529
the identified extensions which which

909
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,000
should have come from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> animated</font>

910
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">registry or are they</font>

911
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,610
once the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> evar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll just</font>

912
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:32,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave it at that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I think</font>

913
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,120
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the way for it is like</font>

914
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,799
what we'd like to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is assuming again</font>

915
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,270
like the chairs are okay with us making

916
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,530
more changes to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document yeah I</font>

917
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,630
mean I think we're at the point where we

918
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:43,930
need to you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to produce</font>

919
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,370
something useful so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yes</font>

920
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,259
under the assumption will probably like

921
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,750
right up Laura fication suggestions for

922
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we think is a good idea and</font>

923
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,450
bring it up like each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them to the</font>

924
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,060
list to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that there is</font>

925
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,950
consensus and then hash out like the few

926
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,770
remaining disagreements and I said like

927
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,450
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest needs to have like am a</font>

928
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,490
separate document describes like the

929
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">different of city that provides extra no</font>

930
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,359
guarantees describes exactly how you

931
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,520
choose stages what the comments from the

932
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:14,790
servers are and this sort of thing but I

933
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,960
guess we'll see about that one missions

934
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

935
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,260
that's been a tremendous amount of work

936
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,810
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past few weeks and it's much</font>

937
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,620
appreciated but there's more work

938
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:28,150
tremendous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work yet to be done</font>

939
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:34,839
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i Sabbah here yeah okay great</font>

940
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:37,180
you're up I weren't oh right right we're

941
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:41,250
moving on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and redaction</font>

942
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:44,490
section on saavn<font color="#CCCCCC"> scott another close one</font>

943
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,490
there we go

944
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:04,529
okay thanks saris<font color="#E5E5E5"> life-changing I am oh</font>

945
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,690
great all right I might bother you a lot

946
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,300
okay yeah I did a lot of heads but we've

947
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:12,510
got about 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i should book it</font>

948
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so hi guys I'm Saba um I want</font>

949
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you guys about some some work</font>

950
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,930
I did with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applied crypto group</font>

951
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,950
at Stanford recently um and so what I'm

952
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,649
going to talk about you can read about

953
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,439
in our paper it's on the archive<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

954
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I sent a link to it to the mailing list</font>

955
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,950
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that the paper</font>

956
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,620
includes on the next slide and we have

957
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,839
some ideas for redaction how we can get

958
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,670
private sub domains in CT and then some

959
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,240
ideas about privacy preserving<font color="#E5E5E5"> proofs</font>

960
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,500
that a log has excluded an SCT and then

961
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,089
we have some other discussions about

962
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,010
privacy compromises and ideas about how

963
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,630
CT and portlet certificates can be made

964
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together but I'm only going to</font>

965
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">focus on the the first couple things a</font>

966
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,859
light on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide yeah so if you</font>

967
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,450
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read more about this or about</font>

968
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,690
the other things you can look at the

969
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:05,009
paper so i'll jump right into the the

970
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,750
redaction idea so yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem of</font>

971
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,660
reduction I think we're all familiar

972
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:13,340
with we don't want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

973
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:16,410
domain names on the wall so ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

974
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,150
any secret facebook com type domain

975
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,100
wouldn't appear on the log so on the

976
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:22,620
next slide we have a example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you</font>

977
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">want we want this to be hidden um or I</font>

978
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,109
think we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> content ourselves if on</font>

979
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:30,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next slide we just redact the the</font>

980
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,560
secret portion so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm</font>

981
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it achieves this</font>

982
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,779
where if you have a domain name with

983
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,970
some redacted sub domain as a part of it

984
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,040
we can redact that part of the domain I

985
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,410
think it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple and effective</font>

986
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,300
idea that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like so the</font>

987
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,640
tool we're going to use is called a

988
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,500
commitment and the commitment is kind of

989
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,930
the crypto equivalent of having a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

990
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">box so if you want a commitment in lock</font>

991
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,140
box you put something<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside and then</font>

992
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,250
you lock it and then you give it to

993
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody and they can't see what's</font>

994
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,120
inside the box but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also since you</font>

995
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,709
put something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the box you can't</font>

996
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,450
change it so commitment is kind of a

997
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,950
digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the same thing so</font>

998
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,660
when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some number or some</font>

999
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,040
information that you commit to and then

1000
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,500
you send it off to some other party the

1001
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,320
other party's not able to see what it is

1002
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've committed to</font>

1003
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,770
but later on when you reveal the

1004
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,480
commitment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no option but to</font>

1005
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,520
reveal what you originally committed to

1006
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,040
so in this sense the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment has a</font>

1007
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,200
hiding property that what's in a

1008
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,790
commitment is is hidden from whoever

1009
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,890
looks at the commitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also has</font>

1010
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,480
a binding property that once you commit

1011
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,160
to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't equivocate later</font>

1012
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,390
and change your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and say no I commit</font>

1013
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to something else you're kind of forced</font>

1014
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:38,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to commit to what you to reveal what</font>

1015
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,430
you committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that quickly</font>

1016
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:43,210
other any questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font>

1017
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:44,799
commitment is no great so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1018
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,620
we build these yeah you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip</font>

1019
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,110
through all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe want</font>

1020
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,600
that the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we build these is is</font>

1021
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:54,010
straightforward um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like you</font>

1022
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,390
can do this with hashes so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1023
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build the commitment is if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1024
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">message do you want to commit then you</font>

1025
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,790
take some randomness that's like the

1026
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,500
commitment the key equivalent and then

1027
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,120
you hash the the message concatenated

1028
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,520
with the randomness and then the output

1029
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,140
is the commitment this gets around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1030
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,520
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a dictionary attack on</font>

1031
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,810
just hashing because now to do a

1032
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,310
dictionary attack you not only need to

1033
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:15,009
guess the input but you need to guess

1034
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:16,150
all the randomness as well so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1035
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:20,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this to do</font>

1036
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,180
redaction is um when a domain owner

1037
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,280
issues a request for certificate to the

1038
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">CA it's going to send the all the</font>

1039
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,770
information needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

1040
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,779
certificate but it's also going to send

1041
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:31,030
a version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the domain name with the</font>

1042
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,890
secret components redacted by using a

1043
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,300
commitment as well as the randomness

1044
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,549
that you need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commitment and</font>

1045
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,520
then when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA sends a message to the</font>

1046
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,350
log on the next slide um all it sends is

1047
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,320
the pre certificate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

1048
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,940
that's the redacted version so we get on

1049
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">vlog eventually if you go to the next</font>

1050
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,250
slide is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the redacted version</font>

1051
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,230
with the secret sub domain hidden and

1052
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,920
then the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain owners name listed</font>

1053
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:59,470
publicly and the SCT would get the that

1054
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,420
that same information so just have the

1055
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,009
redacted domain in it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally when</font>

1056
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,470
you get to the certificate on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1057
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,360
slide um the certificate is going to

1058
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:11,379
include the actual domain name as well

1059
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,600
as the redacted SCT and the opening of

1060
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,760
the SCT so when a client gets this

1061
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,330
certificate all they need to do is on

1062
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,790
the next slide they're going to ya when

1063
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they request the page then they get the</font>

1064
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:28,480
certificate back on the next slide

1065
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:32,440
and sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing then on the next</font>

1066
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,930
slide the they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to verify that</font>

1067
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,920
the commitment component of the SCT

1068
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,910
actually corresponds to the the the

1069
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,980
thing that the certificate is

1070
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,920
purportedly for so if you have some

1071
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,050
commitment to secret facebook com you

1072
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,210
need to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sut included</font>

1073
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:52,000
is actually for secret facebook com and

1074
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,440
not for some other some other site

1075
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's somewhat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to pass off as</font>

1076
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,089
being for secret facebook com um so on

1077
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,190
the next slide we briefly discussed

1078
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:01,720
security of this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the those two</font>

1079
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,700
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come to mind for security</font>

1080
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,740
one is how is a monitor still going to

1081
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,868
do its job if we have redaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1082
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general reduction</font>

1083
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:13,000
question um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea here would be</font>

1084
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:15,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you know how many entries there</font>

1085
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,839
are from like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook you can look and</font>

1086
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,310
see hey there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we thought</font>

1087
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">there would be 16 entries for facebook</font>

1088
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,240
there are 17 entries from facebook

1089
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,619
something is clearly wrong here or I

1090
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,779
mean if you have knowledge of the

1091
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:26,859
individual s cts you could if you know

1092
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,530
the randomness<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of check</font>

1093
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:31,150
them one by one as well um also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1094
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,910
another natural question is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't a</font>

1095
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,619
malicious site or CA um<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that we</font>

1096
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,660
use an SCT that's already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log and</font>

1097
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:39,400
this is prevented by the hiding for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1098
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,460
binding property of the commitment yeah

1099
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,319
so this needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the life a lot</font>

1100
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">worse for the site operator books when</font>

1101
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,859
he discovers a problem up here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

1102
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,140
effectively a<font color="#E5E5E5"> parity problem now he has</font>

1103
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:52,000
several investigating right when there's

1104
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,118
a parody problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we discovered so the</font>

1105
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,349
set operator you know I have five fifty

1106
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,660
thousand certificates to my site which

1107
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,910
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like crazy pants right and now I</font>

1108
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,450
discover that their 50001 certificates

1109
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:06,009
and now what I did because my problem is

1110
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,770
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know whether there's some</font>

1111
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:11,020
suction my organization which like is

1112
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,450
issuing certificates on boats to me

1113
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,829
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite likely or</font>

1114
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:17,649
whether it's or weather like this is

1115
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:21,069
this an attack so how do i resolve that

1116
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,210
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess one way to</font>

1117
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,650
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is if you if you're concerned</font>

1118
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,329
about segments of the organization we

1119
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:28,650
could have more granularity in terms of

1120
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:31,089
like what what levels of sub domain is a

1121
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,530
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what level is not but that's</font>

1122
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:34,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a that's not a complete solution</font>

1123
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">either right I have basically its food</font>

1124
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:38,830
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Missoula or barred on the solar or</font>

1125
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,630
gossip is all that org and

1126
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,549
you know so the region i have right<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1127
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,320
I've got like basically you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1128
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,610
know like most the organization is like

1129
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,930
like doing with both of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I got</font>

1130
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,340
some support organization which getting

1131
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:51,629
stiff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Achatz for those of the mains and</font>

1132
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,040
I'm somewhere that fact right right I

1133
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:55,930
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parity or even</font>

1134
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,550
about count right if you're actually

1135
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,020
doing a proper monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eugene need to</font>

1136
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,740
know the certificates your organization

1137
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,940
has actually issued all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and your</font>

1138
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,160
Union look at the stuff that's in the

1139
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,920
logs and compare what's in the logs with

1140
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,779
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us or search the Domino I think I</font>

1141
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,730
know all and then when I see a new one

1142
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,980
right disco I see a new one and it's

1143
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,570
surprising and then what I do is I go on

1144
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,540
and try to investigate it and I say oh

1145
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,970
this is you know this this is damn

1146
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,529
dummies<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh Lord right 92 why Carl and I</font>

1147
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:30,790
say you really issue this resist attack

1148
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:32,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is I say this is so that's also</font>

1149
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:37,060
goes my recourse I all see a sanity give

1150
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:39,430
it doesn't know doesn't so the the if we

1151
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,750
go back a couple of slides the the key

1152
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the commitment is going to be</font>

1153
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,020
held by the site as well as by this yay

1154
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,680
so they can be put in the certificate if

1155
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,970
you want so um you could I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1156
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">could call this day and you commit but</font>

1157
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,109
also like Facebook would have the should

1158
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,340
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D commitment yeah the zinger of</font>

1159
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,630
misunderstandings I usually

1160
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,570
uncooperative or in some organizations

1161
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,160
issued certificates of my name it's

1162
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually totally happens so like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1163
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so I don't know my problem is I</font>

1164
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,110
have you know ten divisions and I don't

1165
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,150
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> which division miss issued or</font>

1166
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,770
actually properly issued and so how do I

1167
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:14,140
go ask them this is a real certificate

1168
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:16,000
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so how do you do this one do not</font>

1169
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,370
protect it and you see the certificate

1170
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,140
you know but we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the main name in</font>

1171
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,970
the me and generally is like is

1172
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,490
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something kind of figure</font>

1173
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">out like it says your project x blog my</font>

1174
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:28,810
gonna say<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's what who the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hell is</font>

1175
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Project X blah and and I say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

1176
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:32,650
right or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and eventually I say</font>

1177
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,410
like well then<font color="#E5E5E5"> muscling this issue right</font>

1178
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,150
um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1179
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,520
very painful not have any idea who it is

1180
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,650
um so I mean I'm not saying this is a

1181
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,920
non-starter but I'm saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like not</font>

1182
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:46,540
awesome is<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I mean couldn't if</font>

1183
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,610
that's your organizational policy and

1184
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't plan on doing redactions then</font>

1185
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:52,239
you could just say if it's redacted but

1186
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,649
you could this is an Orion

1187
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,089
no choice right are we willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open</font>

1188
00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:56,499
ourselves up internally to this thing or

1189
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:58,749
are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say no one should be</font>

1190
00:52:56,499 --> 00:53:00,009
issuing redacted certs or than our

1191
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:01,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">condition because we do because we don't</font>

1192
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:04,329
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capacity to track people that</font>

1193
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:05,679
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants well</font>

1194
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,119
no but what I'm saying is as an

1195
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,859
organization you have an opportunity you

1196
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">can say no one in our organization</font>

1197
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:13,119
should issue protected starts and if you

1198
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:15,249
do issue redacted and she starts with

1199
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,589
redacted s cts then something's wrong

1200
00:53:15,249 --> 00:53:21,459
you're out of company policy anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1201
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:25,779
ever like yeah then you then you revoke

1202
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:27,489
those circus right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean they never</font>

1203
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:28,989
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this issue an offensive</font>

1204
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:31,359
position which means our<font color="#CCCCCC"> pub which means</font>

1205
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:33,849
have a CA recourse problem and so I mean

1206
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,739
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> look I'm not I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like</font>

1207
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:37,119
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like like like I was asking a</font>

1208
00:53:35,739 --> 00:53:40,119
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I have gotten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

1209
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,499
hand um like uh you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font>

1210
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,729
understand poverty is the system I'm not

1211
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:49,319
saying please continue yeah this seems

1212
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:49,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you like a feature not a bug right</font>

1213
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:58,299
so it puts a high cost of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1214
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:00,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">use word action on the people who want</font>

1215
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:03,849
to use redaction as opposed to fusing it

1216
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,349
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole look yeah but just a</font>

1217
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:10,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of neat</font>

1218
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:12,519
though nope I'm sorry just was added I

1219
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:15,059
think that problem and I crazed I think

1220
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:19,269
exists in all of them in all the

1221
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:20,559
reduction schemes I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yeah thanks</font>

1222
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:22,238
man i think that was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font>

1223
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,439
kind of a general<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about reduction</font>

1224
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:28,359
but I'm gonna javis crab so Victor

1225
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:30,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">dacovian says you could require a</font>

1226
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:36,808
contact address in every legitimate

1227
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:36,809
certificate no that's also privacy leaky

1228
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:44,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like me if we're making stuff up on</font>

1229
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:46,539
the fly like we can say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must have a</font>

1230
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:51,459
dns entry in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ECOD plus wrong with a</font>

1231
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:55,359
public key in and blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah the forum</font>

1232
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:56,529
for making stuff up on the fly I'm not

1233
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,869
I'm not gonna I'm gonna start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

1234
00:54:56,529 --> 00:55:01,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic how do you tell that you need to</font>

1235
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:03,999
verify this thing that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1236
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:05,828
verify that that you need that it that

1237
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:10,450
it is in the form that you described

1238
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:11,890
how would I tell by stone oh so how do

1239
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,749
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that it's like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1240
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:16,299
commitment versus this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually like</font>

1241
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:17,950
some weird string dot facebook com why I

1242
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:19,660
guess there has to be some flag or some

1243
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:30,129
indication the certificate that this is

1244
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:35,410
yeah I commit minute not Ben Schwartz

1245
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:38,859
jigsaw so is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a what happens if the</font>

1246
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:40,299
unredacted certificate leaks and in

1247
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:45,130
particular does that create a problem

1248
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:46,900
for a CA who's committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

1249
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:48,279
publicly stated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will put all</font>

1250
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,819
of their certificates into certificate

1251
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:53,140
transparency or is there how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we how</font>

1252
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:55,150
do we combine this idea that all

1253
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,339
certificates generated go into the CT

1254
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">logs with this idea that that now</font>

1255
00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:03,940
actually only in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of them</font>

1256
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:04,989
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the CT box so I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

1257
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,029
fully understood your question but I

1258
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:08,680
guess the idea is how if so if is

1259
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:10,150
certificate that has an SCT that's

1260
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,649
committed is leaked publicly then

1261
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,329
clearly everybody in the world knows

1262
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this redacted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SCT is connected with</font>

1263
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">this certificate because they've shown</font>

1264
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:19,900
up together yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

1265
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:21,160
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with redaction also in general</font>

1266
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,829
like it when you get if you know if you

1267
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this SCT from the site and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

1268
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:28,630
redacted then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1269
00:56:25,479 --> 00:56:30,549
public with it sure let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me let me try a</font>

1270
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,799
different version of this um if I'm a

1271
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:34,809
customer of a CA and that CA has

1272
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,670
publicly committed to log all the

1273
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:39,130
certificates that it generates into the

1274
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,989
CT logs how do I tell it please generate

1275
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,029
this certificate for me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put it</font>

1276
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:45,160
into the logs and in violation of your

1277
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:48,249
public commitment I promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm</font>

1278
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,140
also going to register a commitment to

1279
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:51,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">this name and you will be able to log</font>

1280
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:57,098
that and does not violate your

1281
00:56:51,819 --> 00:57:00,609
commitment so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that the so</font>

1282
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:02,979
the commitment gets put on the log so

1283
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:05,859
the order<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you had them in here i'm</font>

1284
00:57:02,979 --> 00:57:07,689
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a customer of a CA</font>

1285
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:09,308
yeah it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me there's a point at</font>

1286
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,799
which i have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask the ca to sign a</font>

1287
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:13,749
certificate and not put that certificate

1288
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:15,430
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certificate transparency log if</font>

1289
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:16,988
they've issued a press release that says

1290
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,480
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put every certificate into</font>

1291
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:21,700
the log then

1292
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,420
they're they're violating<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how</font>

1293
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:28,109
did why is it not um one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I if if</font>

1294
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,280
possible I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move the</font>

1295
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:33,009
discussions of redaction more generally

1296
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,540
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the redaction more generally section</font>

1297
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:40,300
this is providing background on one

1298
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:43,630
proposal yeah so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think um that's all</font>

1299
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,140
I've got on reduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have more slides</font>

1300
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,609
on this yeah that's so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

1301
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,859
I have on reduction I was gonna ask if

1302
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:53,830
there's any questions but I guess we

1303
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:55,440
jumped ahead and we took care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so</font>

1304
00:57:53,830 --> 00:58:01,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about is</font>

1305
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:05,800
about proofs of phlogiston yeah I'd like

1306
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do react is Clinton here yeah okay</font>

1307
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:15,369
come back later yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay so</font>

1308
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,960
we obviously already have a lot of

1309
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:19,150
discussion topics i'm going to go

1310
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this as quickly as possible so</font>

1311
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,750
we can get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good stuff this is</font>

1312
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:24,280
basically just supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a</font>

1313
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,619
background to make sure that we're kind

1314
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same page as far as where</font>

1315
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:32,140
redactions at where it's come from so we

1316
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,640
have kind of two general reasons for

1317
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:37,900
redaction that have been discussed in

1318
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:41,890
the past going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my 2014 1 is for</font>

1319
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:45,940
privacy one is for secrecy the topics

1320
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:49,290
we've just discussed today it been folks

1321
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">around secrecy so privacy is something</font>

1322
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:54,550
that has to do with kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of removing</font>

1323
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:57,280
data from a log so it's already been

1324
00:58:54,550 --> 00:59:00,820
entered into the log all of a sudden

1325
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nick it contains you know PII and you</font>

1326
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,680
get a court order to remove it do we

1327
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,680
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve that technologically do we</font>

1328
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,129
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1329
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually remove an entry from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the log or</font>

1330
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:17,070
replace an entry in a log while still

1331
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:21,279
allowing that log to continue to be used

1332
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:23,020
I and I think the where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

1333
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,650
left off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion is left off is</font>

1334
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:32,200
that this probably isn't something that

1335
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:36,760
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to solve in the working group if</font>

1336
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:39,368
ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an implementer CT can't</font>

1337
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,890
rotate logs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be agile and their</font>

1338
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:46,839
trusted blogs then there's there's kind

1339
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bigger problems the only concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1340
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:55,390
think that you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to</font>

1341
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:58,839
address or discuss is that if a you know

1342
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the privacy concern was raised</font>

1343
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:04,299
about a specific entry or that

1344
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:07,118
certificate was had an entry and all of

1345
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,380
the logs than an ecosystem used then

1346
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,560
that could be potentially catastrophic

1347
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:14,200
to the specific ecosystem but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

1348
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:17,980
that's really a i think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for</font>

1349
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,569
the policy over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner to solve so</font>

1350
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,250
that's that's kind of privacy the second

1351
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:23,760
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is secrecy this is pretty</font>

1352
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:26,200
certificate so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just never</font>

1353
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:31,089
entering some part of the actual

1354
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:33,490
certificate into the the CT log and this

1355
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:36,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is general consensus is</font>

1356
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:41,129
at least worth discussing or continuing

1357
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:45,849
to to figure out all of the the current

1358
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:49,510
drafts as well as the discussions so the

1359
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:52,540
this 16 was in the current version even

1360
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">include this Rob's traveling's draft he</font>

1361
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:58,960
has out the proposal that Peter put out

1362
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:02,069
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list and then solids as well all</font>

1363
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,569
kind of center around this idea of just

1364
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:07,480
preventing some data figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way</font>

1365
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:11,980
to have some data not included in the

1366
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:15,369
cert know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so Peter Bowen</font>

1367
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:17,829
put on the list I think a set of a base

1368
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:19,750
assumptions we kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have what</font>

1369
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:23,410
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals of redaction again this is</font>

1370
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:26,020
for pre certificate redaction I think

1371
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,490
it's a good set of goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> I updated it</font>

1372
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,130
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the discussion and the email</font>

1373
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:33,910
list but if we kind of all agree that

1374
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:35,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we want redaction to do and</font>

1375
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,680
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things it</font>

1376
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,640
needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to be successful</font>

1377
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,419
then I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

1378
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,220
discussion if there are things that we

1379
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:49,240
you know disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with here then</font>

1380
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:50,830
I don't know hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's consensus</font>

1381
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,169
since this discussion already took<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

1382
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:56,020
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list I'm working out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

1383
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:59,980
assumption as well so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1384
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">next slide so redaction was added in</font>

1385
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:07,930
april 2014 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to two forms of</font>

1386
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:11,049
redaction domain name redaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like</font>

1387
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:13,569
like wasabi presented we're not

1388
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:15,640
including secret example<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm at the</font>

1389
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just replace any</font>

1390
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:21,759
secret with private with the word

1391
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:23,800
private it yeah so and then the other

1392
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">one was named constrained intermediate</font>

1393
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:29,550
CA so if the intermediate CA is is

1394
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:33,099
constrained to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific domains than</font>

1395
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:35,260
anything issued by that CA on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on those</font>

1396
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:40,000
domains doesn't need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included in</font>

1397
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:42,280
the log itself and we've had you know

1398
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,030
various updates occurred over the next

1399
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:48,340
two years and this 16 was kind of the

1400
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">next stage where this really came up</font>

1401
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:56,140
again as a topic last year and there's a

1402
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:59,070
bunch of discussion at that time it

1403
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:01,740
still contained the same two basic

1404
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:04,420
versions or mechanisms for redaction

1405
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:09,009
domain labels and in constrained

1406
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:10,570
intermedia cas this<font color="#E5E5E5"> added the idea of an</font>

1407
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">extension you know like like what we</font>

1408
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:14,740
discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Sabo we need to have some</font>

1409
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:18,640
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mechanism identifying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1410
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:22,779
need to do a verification of the SCT

1411
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:26,020
versus certificate so Adam<font color="#E5E5E5"> Everett acted</font>

1412
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:30,460
labels extension but it was pretty

1413
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:32,970
complex for a TLS client to actually go

1414
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:37,810
through that verification<font color="#E5E5E5"> process quiet</font>

1415
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:41,589
decoding Andrey encoding a fair bit and

1416
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:45,460
it wasn't I it wasn't unique so you

1417
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:47,619
couldn't if you had a pre certificate it

1418
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:51,460
could theoretically match to multiple

1419
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:53,290
fall certificates this this version as

1420
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,440
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand is what's currently</font>

1421
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:58,990
implemented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic in some cases so</font>

1422
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,720
they're they're logging redacted certs

1423
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:04,149
right now that use the mechanism

1424
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:07,029
described in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this 16 so you know the</font>

1425
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">next slide so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I understand</font>

1426
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,290
the current three proposals or

1427
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:15,960
mechanisms that are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

1428
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:20,170
discuss today one is this 17 and

1429
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:24,280
straddling a draft it updates the the

1430
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:26,800
redaction mechanisms a fair bit it uses

1431
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:30,580
a you know it still includes the main

1432
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:32,410
constraint CA and the domain labels it

1433
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses a redacted subject alt name</font>

1434
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:38,379
extension so all these kinda have some

1435
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:42,520
common common threads with different

1436
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:44,740
names for them it's it's it's quite a

1437
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:48,430
bit better for TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> client to implement a</font>

1438
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:50,939
lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot less complex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know of</font>

1439
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:56,379
any log operators that are actually

1440
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:58,660
implementing this the next one is solace

1441
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,960
I won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that one but savas is</font>

1442
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:06,839
another version there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously some</font>

1443
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:08,740
some similarities between that one and

1444
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,840
straddling strapped and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1445
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:14,049
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that Peter Bowen and Tara</font>

1446
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:17,859
wheeler posted to the list just the

1447
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:20,740
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> day this adds a pre certificate</font>

1448
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:23,080
transformation extension it adds support

1449
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:29,500
for the first time for IP addresses in

1450
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:32,080
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS names and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

1451
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:35,380
current version is a pretty complex

1452
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:38,590
similar to this 16 but Peters working on

1453
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:42,400
on updating that and and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1454
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:46,720
more client family so I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robin Peter</font>

1455
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,970
on the on the call remotely so I don't

1456
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,669
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we want to have them give some</font>

1457
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:55,118
overview of where they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at with with</font>

1458
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:56,560
their proposals or their ideas but we

1459
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,600
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the discussion that</font>

1460
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:02,890
we were having with saba and kind of

1461
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:04,509
opened up discuss redaction at large and

1462
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:07,930
and how we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look how we wanted</font>

1463
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to function hopefully decide on its way</font>

1464
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:15,450
forward here yeah we will

1465
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,400
short on time actually um so I'm not

1466
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> additional presentations on</font>

1467
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,740
this on this topic on I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

1468
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:23,970
there are some immediate questions this

1469
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,790
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good time to do it but I do</font>

1470
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:31,169
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the next presentation</font>

1471
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:36,930
within what time what time is it yeah

1472
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:39,150
within about four minutes yeah so should

1473
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:40,500
we just take this to the list based on

1474
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the discussions that have been brought</font>

1475
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:46,140
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> very recently on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shabbos proposal and</font>

1476
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,939
Peter's proposal we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continue</font>

1477
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,529
those on the list and move from there

1478
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,570
yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be discussed</font>

1479
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,860
on the list anyway so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you if</font>

1480
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,270
somebody's questions that could go to

1481
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list take him to the list if there's</font>

1482
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:58,350
something that would benefit from a

1483
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,720
face-to-face let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now this is dkg</font>

1484
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just wanted to clarify the terminology</font>

1485
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,129
your frame this discussion in or you

1486
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,930
have privacy versus secrecy the privacy

1487
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,760
really seems to be more about toxic data

1488
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:10,470
and might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is relevant</font>

1489
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,600
after something has already been entered

1490
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:13,919
into the log in a non redacted form and

1491
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,920
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of these address the</font>

1492
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,270
toxic data<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right so yeah</font>

1493
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,900
the question is whether we need to solve

1494
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:24,180
that technologically for instance if I'm

1495
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:26,520
an implementer I can just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

1496
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:28,560
run a log and toxic data was submitted

1497
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,090
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer trust that log</font>

1498
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,240
now you can do whatever you want with it

1499
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:34,950
blow it away you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get rid of it so</font>

1500
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:39,779
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have a technological</font>

1501
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:42,149
solution to removing toxic data all

1502
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,800
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it wasn't one way you could</font>

1503
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:45,780
do this it's just run multiple

1504
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,140
experiments have everybody write this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1505
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,520
as experimental wraps gather

1506
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,859
implementation and deployment experience

1507
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:56,759
and so go from there right well there

1508
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:58,950
imeem there yes but there's there are

1509
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,110
people doing redacted doing with action

1510
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:03,060
now semantics and it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1511
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:05,220
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course true to what we're</font>

1512
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we wanted</font>

1513
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:11,549
puns on this too much that's her Wes

1514
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">article USC so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem I</font>

1515
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,610
see with this is you're taking a fairly

1516
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,780
simple solution that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to</font>

1517
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:18,150
make sure that everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always</font>

1518
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,650
published and then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1519
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:21,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out ways how to not publish stuff</font>

1520
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:23,009
in it or two published up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret</font>

1521
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,150
and and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this simple</font>

1522
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">system and make it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

1523
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:26,910
incredibly come

1524
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:28,500
is trying to deal with reaction and

1525
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:30,180
trying to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know privacy and</font>

1526
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,500
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into issues of well</font>

1527
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,150
how do we solve offline dictionary

1528
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,399
attacks to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of things you're</font>

1529
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get into issues of well okay</font>

1530
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I you're right I did not you know</font>

1531
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,170
produce this entry in my log or I

1532
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce this private entry my log</font>

1533
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:48,000
because example.com told me to even

1534
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:49,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">though they really didn't so then you</font>

1535
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,600
get into he said he should kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1536
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,939
comments and the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you</font>

1537
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,830
know the notion of certificate

1538
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:57,870
transparency was to be open and honest

1539
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:59,790
and we're now inserting ways that's

1540
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:05,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break those conversations in</font>

1541
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the future I think that's definitely a</font>

1542
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:10,470
valid concern going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1543
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:13,470
assumptions that Peter set out we do

1544
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:17,010
have to acknowledge that things like DNS

1545
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:21,300
split-horizon and private<font color="#E5E5E5"> name server</font>

1546
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:23,460
delegation exist so there's you know

1547
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically there's public certs used</font>

1548
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:30,740
privately but is that something that we

1549
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:33,000
you know would need to address with CT

1550
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you very much appreciate it</font>

1551
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,979
and of course it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much more</font>

1552
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:43,250
discussion on the mailing list next up

1553

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of logging binaries I</font>

1554
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:55,980
think yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about yeah</font>

1555
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:59,340
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone its pressure from Maui I</font>

1556
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:02,040
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a topic but maybe I'll</font>

1557
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,920
keep silent for some time and now we we

1558
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:08,310
try to print again and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1559
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to based on be based on</font>

1560
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:15,000
the the city pro a mechanism to do the

1561
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:19,230
software distribution monitoring and

1562
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,200
auditory so is the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is how to</font>

1563
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:26,299
extend the current city protocol to do

1564
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:28,620
this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font>

1565
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:31,230
extension protocol to log in the

1566
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:34,470
software binary codes oh it's a type OS

1567
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:38,549
digest so because some sometime the

1568
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:40,260
software provided to not want to want to

1569
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:43,320
you know and there are some license

1570
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,900
restriction or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure to</font>

1571
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,780
in the air lock in they are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

1572
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:52,440
content on the lock tree so that's why

1573
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:54,389
maybe sometimes we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this digest so no</font>

1574
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,369
logging these informations can bring

1575
01:10:54,389 --> 01:10:58,829
some benefits I think this benefits are

1576
01:10:56,369 --> 01:11:01,860
very similar to the teaching benefits so

1577
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:03,869
it can associate k enable anyone to

1578
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:08,369
monetary and audio deter the software

1579
01:11:03,869 --> 01:11:11,070
provider activity so if if they do the

1580
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:13,739
mystic miss distribution if it's

1581
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:17,250
something legal software provider to

1582
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:20,928
distributor the the some software<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1583
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:24,030
and we can also find a back door of the

1584
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:27,210
distributed software and also we can

1585
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there are a lot of locks there</font>

1586
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:32,130
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can compare the lock the lock</font>

1587
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,070
forced for the same software in

1588
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:38,309
different locks so maybe it can also

1589
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:40,650
help us to find some progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

1590
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:43,469
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the city for the</font>

1591
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:46,860
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the monitoring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

1592
01:11:43,469 --> 01:11:50,570
page and so how to do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

1593
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:54,509
the just like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we just simply</font>

1594
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:58,139
extended just simply extend current city

1595
01:11:54,510 --> 01:12:02,280
locking mechanism so so what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1596
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:05,070
we extend firstly we need to lock the

1597
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:08,309
software binary codes or is digested

1598
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:11,639
into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> more Croce moco tricky</font>

1599
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:14,579
mussoorie more country<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and instead</font>

1600
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:19,110
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tis server certificate and also</font>

1601
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:21,090
when we log it and the the Sangha the

1602
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:27,119
same time step is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the binary code</font>

1603
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:29,639
okay and and so based on this based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1604
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:33,150
this idea we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

1605
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">extension to the current Samsung some</font>

1606
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:38,719
data structure of the marquetry of the

1607
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:43,139
lock system such as we need to devise a

1608
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:46,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">new type trans I turn a new market</font>

1609
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:48,599
released and a new SPT definition and

1610
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:51,260
also we need to extend the Sun current

1611
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:54,980
or certificate transparency

1612
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:58,250
message process of the input output

1613
01:12:54,980 --> 01:13:00,980
output permits a budget the other things

1614
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:05,420
are a totally the same with a CT

1615
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:07,339
protocol another page<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay an actual</font>

1616
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:09,860
real informing pages I<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed all the</font>

1617
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:12,139
changes or other extensions to current

1618
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:14,630
the city protocol and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is about</font>

1619
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:17,900
the new binary transparency log entry

1620
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:19,579
actually the the main point is that here

1621
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:23,030
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientist software</font>

1622
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:28,039
attributes in this entry it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> binary</font>

1623
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:30,518

01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:35,619
it and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> capable either in the CMS</font>

1625
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:38,539
format this this object<font color="#E5E5E5"> included the</font>

1628
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:49,099
described as the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next page</font>

1629
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:51,800
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think in the Union</font>

foster presentation about the base

1631
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:58,280
protocol there are some there will be

1632
01:13:53,960 --> 01:14:01,130
some changes updated so here I can that

1633
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:04,159
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my my craft where r follow</font>

the the base drafts of update such as

1635
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:09,949
maybe the the new type of being

1636
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:13,669
estimating<font color="#E5E5E5"> with proof computing mood</font>

1637
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:15,710
right yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buttered because my</font>

1638
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:18,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently drafting is based on the on</font>

1639
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:22,429
the older version of just yeah so that's

1640
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:25,880
a song new enumeration type of order for

1641
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:30,500
the structure of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the law okay and</font>

1642
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:33,710
a next page and also this is about the

1643
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:37,460
new moco tree leaves the main difference

1644
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:39,260
is that here we this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

1645
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:42,460
certificate information this is about

1646
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:46,010
the software binary code information and

1647
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:48,409
it's a it's a data structure of of

1648
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:51,860
weight defined in the previous page

1649
01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:55,049
about the binary code entry right okay

1650
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:59,219
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next page and</font>

1651
01:14:55,050 --> 01:15:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the the the the the signs a</font>

1652
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:08,580

01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:11,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> object on the iTunes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this</font>

1654
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:15,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing these are the two new updated our</font>

1655
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:20,720
messages why is how we add a new binary

1656
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:24,540
code entry into the certificate lock so

1657
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:27,810
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some new inputs and outputs</font>

1658
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:30,180
and I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go into too much</font>

1659
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:33,000
details and about another wise how to

1660
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:35,700
get the log entries from the from the

1661
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,340
tree and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some extension</font>

1662
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:41,429
to them so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

1663
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to agreed the document thank you and I</font>

1664
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:49,020
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's all and yeah I think I can</font>

1665
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:51,690
follow the latest update of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font>

1666
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:55,410
paint<font color="#E5E5E5"> mythical draft and do this work</font>

1667
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:58,080
yeah your emissary google so one

1668
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:59,760
question is about preventing log spam

1669
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,920
right so insignificant<font color="#CCCCCC"> furnace it's very</font>

1670
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,290
easy to only accept submissions that

1671
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,420
makes sense because just check signature

1672
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:09,150
chain here you also allow a condition

1673
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,890
correctly logging of just the hashes of

1674
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:13,139
of the software rather than like the

1675
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:15,270
full binary so how do you how do you

1676
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,860
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you only get valuable</font>

1677
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:26,870
submission and not just like random

1678
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:26,870
hashes huh yes good point i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1679
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:33,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see i think this year problem we</font>

1680
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:36,330
can't agree with just a very straight

1681
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:38,639
folder to<font color="#CCCCCC"> extend at the city city</font>

1682
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:42,809
protocol and we have the software harsh

1683
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:46,080
we have the issue and the and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

1684
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:48,630
the software providers public key use

1685
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:51,809
this information to find the software

1686
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:53,730
provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock but maybe you're</font>

1687
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">not yeah yo your provides on your</font>

1688
01:16:53,730 --> 01:17:00,179
problem yeah in this yeah so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1689
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,420
glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this is work in the space of</font>

1690
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:08,260
binary transparency oh i'm richard

1691
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:09,610
barnes um recently of mozilla um so I

1692
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,469
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> us going and one of the things I</font>

1693
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:12,759
worked on when I was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last</font>

1694
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:15,969
things I worked on was all a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

1695
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:19,210
ago um was getting a basic binary

1696
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:20,170
transparency scheme set up there um so

1697
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:22,719
you might take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as an</font>

1698
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:24,280
antecedent because<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that scheme is</font>

1699
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,139
just hacked on top of certificate

1700
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,539
transparency so instead of having

1701
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:31,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting the binary directly into the log</font>

1702
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:33,639
that scheme takes a digest of the

1703
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:35,650
binaries you want to log and codes that

1704
01:17:33,639 --> 01:17:37,119
into a domain name if she gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cert</font>

1705
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:40,420
with that they may name in log that to

1706
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:42,789
CT okay so yeah he's another way yeah

1707
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,920
you can hack this on top of CT it's a

1708
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:46,630
little sketchy I admit yeah and it gets

1709
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,489
the job done you can ask a question

1710
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:49,929
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why did you choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

1711
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:52,449
rather than using like trillion their

1712
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:54,190
son you know it's doing the general

1713
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:58,900
transparency stuff that coming on Google

1714
01:17:54,190 --> 01:18:01,239
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I guess that answers why yeah</font>

1715
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's running code okay we</font>

1716
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:07,299
could just do it um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is</font>

1717
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth thinking through how you could do</font>

1718
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,849
it more directly but without these extra

1719
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:14,590
layers but um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just want to point</font>

1720
01:18:12,849 --> 01:18:17,260
out this from yessum some yeah within

1721
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:19,989
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1722
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:22,329
the plan that Mozilla has talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1723
01:18:19,989 --> 01:18:24,848
is to start publishing this way and

1724
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:26,768
start verifying in the Firefox updater

1725
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:28,480
that things have been logged in this

1726
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:31,469
place so there's will hopefully be seen

1727
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:34,509
running code in a nonzero amount of time

1728
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:36,519
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla be interested in something</font>

1729
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:38,769
that's coming out of the standards space

1730
01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:48,070
I am no longer representing facilities

1731
01:18:38,769 --> 01:18:50,199
all these SMI she's cool so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dkg</font>

1732
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy that this work is going on</font>

1733
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:54,969
there's also work going on outside of

1734
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,619
the ITF on binary transparency there's

1735
01:18:54,969 --> 01:19:00,429
been some discussions that are not

1736
01:18:56,619 --> 01:19:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving very fast but between different</font>

1737
01:19:00,429 --> 01:19:04,809
free software distributions in

1738
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:07,629
particular so debian<font color="#E5E5E5"> and freebsd and pi</font>

1739
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:12,630
PI and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> npm repositories have talked</font>

1740
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:15,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the in those discussions</font>

1741
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:16,869
the we<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach i think a different set of</font>

1742
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:19,030
conclusions than the direction that

1743
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:20,049
you're heading with this draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

1744
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:22,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know want to follow up with you more</font>

1745
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:24,100
on that this off list

1746
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:25,980
but in particular there's a question

1747
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the logs the logs banish you and</font>

1748
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:31,570
ensuring the identity and version of the

1749
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,830
software is a critical component of the

1750
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:34,840
laws because that's what unique in order

1751
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:36,370
to be able to do the review and it's not

1752
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that we have that clearly</font>

1753
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:43,420
enough in that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns length</font>

1754
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:44,800
yes yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain Thompson um Mozilla</font>

1755
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,560
but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have an answer the</font>

1756
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:50,429
question yes we would look on it

1757
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:54,280
favorably and echo will happen answer

1758
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:57,130
the question I got up to ask was you've

1759
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:59,440
got the equivalent of an SCT here is

1760
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:02,110
that really necessary there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1761
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,239
machinery associated with that and it's

1762
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and I don't know how to deliver</font>

1763
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:09,730
one of those with the binary necessarily

1764
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:14,620
in a way that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be consumed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1765
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:16,480
someone actually executed so I suspect

1766
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:19,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you what you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

1767
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:21,940
drop that from any specification and

1768
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:25,600
simply wait until you get the the next

1769
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:31,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">sta I can wait that long if I'm shipping</font>

1770
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:34,420
software Adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> agni Google similar to dkg</font>

1771
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:35,949
I wanted to emphasize the point of

1772
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:37,239
binding transparency as I understand it

1773
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:39,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to make sure that you aren't given</font>

1774
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:42,190
some magical<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoored single</font>

1775

1776
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:46,750
log contains is like the shower hash of

1777
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:48,519
some lump of machine code that's not

1778
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:51,070
really useful it needs to be tied into

1779
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:54,130
things like verifiable builds and like

1780
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:55,719
source trees or it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like the</font>

1781
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:57,520
whole binary and you need to have not

1782
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:04,659
too many versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard is shaking his</font>

1783
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:06,250
head at me maybe I misunderstandings so

1784
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:09,009
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's absolutely it's</font>

1785
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,030
absolutely case that sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> erihskroy so</font>

1786
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:11,590
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is the case in an</font>

1787
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:15,090
ideal world<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is time to verifiable</font>

1788
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:17,050
builds on verifiable is ensure that that

1789
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:18,580
generally this thing you're distributing

1790
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:21,280
matches the source code people can

1791
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:23,199
examine on the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the reason</font>

1792
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,269
we did this episode on preparing his

1793
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,409
parents at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is we is if we're willing</font>

1794
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to commit that we're going to ship this</font>

1795
01:21:26,409 --> 01:21:30,879
many releases then we tied it and we tie

1796
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,699
the binaries of the police's then you

1797
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,560
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> verify that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it when you got 51.1</font>

1798
01:21:33,699 --> 01:21:37,330
that's the same 31.1 info on all scales

1799
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,790
which is better than nothing but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1800
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:42,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">good as what you're saying yeah so</font>

1801
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:43,510
that's that's good too but some

1802
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:47,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in that vein I think is</font>

1803
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:48,760
necessary yeah every scroll up first all

1804
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,559
clock with my mozilla had on and then

1805
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:55,030
take my his all<font color="#E5E5E5"> head often my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 head on</font>

1806
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:57,250
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only have one hat so um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so from</font>

1807
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Missoula</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective on the reason why</font>

1808
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:01,870
we did the hack that were describing is

1809
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,309
because it works today and so we're able

1810
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:05,349
to take advantage of existing log

1811
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:07,360
infrastructure and therefore we were

1812
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,950
able to have that value today so thank

1813
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:12,910
you to google and company providing that

1814
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:15,730
um so we would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in if there</font>

1815
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:17,740
were a someone someone willing to run or

1816
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:20,740
something set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to run a</font>

1817
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:22,660
log buyer conspiracy log that we could

1818
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,940
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they use we would Peterson</font>

1819
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:27,040
using that I don't think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be</font>

1820
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,509
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in using what influence a new</font>

1821
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,920
protocol that was not tied to anybody

1822
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:33,310
operating a loss in size of the value

1823
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:35,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so so that respect so my question</font>

1824
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:36,460
would be is is in fact they're going to

1825
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,200
be enough people willing to run a<font color="#CCCCCC"> binary</font>

1826
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">spesial want to make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

1827
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,940
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll actually occur on now</font>

1828
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:45,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the head off on on this seems to be</font>

1829
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,719
a long ride representing it this used to

1830
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:52,630
be out of charter scope for this working

1831
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:54,010
group on and so um I and soon as we my

1832
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:56,020
working group do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it now and you</font>

1833
01:22:54,010 --> 01:23:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">can they surely k the rechargeable first</font>

1834
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:04,120
even quits<font color="#CCCCCC"> extending the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter are</font>

1835
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:05,350
specifically these kind of purposes so

1836
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,070
that was a lizard's during the initial

1837
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:12,040
territory but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to put it</font>

1838
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:13,269
right and I guess um I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stan the</font>

1839
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,110
scope of the work before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you determine</font>

1840
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,610
where their new working groupers

1841
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:17,110
mediator or where there was in scope for

1842
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:22,870
this working group for some future

1843
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:24,219
generations working great rich sauce

1844
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:27,099
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing is</font>

1845
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:28,510
useful I look at attribute certificates

1846
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">which don't have a key but they have a</font>

1847
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:32,800
place to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> other attributes like they</font>

1848
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:34,089
like a digest of the thing is and then

1849
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,890
the person who signed the attribute is

1850
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software publisher yeah so I'm</font>

1851
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:41,830
address the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spare miss you would also</font>

1852
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:44,170
get identity issue yeah Phil Han Bakic

1853
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:46,150
emotive one of the things that comes to

1854
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,680
mind is that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want somebody to run</font>

1855
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:49,360
log we do actually have some code

1856
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:53,410
signing infrastructure

1857
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:55,420
and his problematic in that every plant

1858
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:57,730
it's not just every CA does different

1859
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,890
things every platform that we support

1860
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:02,589
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> code-signing has a different way of</font>

1861
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:04,720
doing things and signs different things

1862
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that sometimes you're assigned</font>

1863
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,720
executable sometimes it's the package

1864
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:13,840
that installs sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's installer</font>

1865
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:15,910
and I think that probably if we're going

1866
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,820
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than just do the</font>

1867
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:20,950
CT transparency thing I'd rather see a

1868
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:23,590
working group look at how to decode sign

1869
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:25,300
properly across the board this and the

1870
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,430
other reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to do it slightly</font>

1871
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,250
it separately is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1872
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:31,600
mentioning attribute certificates which

1873
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:37,090
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid they gave me the screaming</font>

1874
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:39,700
heebie-jeebies I I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1875
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:43,990
away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 as we saw in that other</font>

1876
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:47,050
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really is evil I'd</font>

1877
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:49,750
rather not build yet more crud on top of

1878
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:54,370
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're going to cut the line</font>

1879
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:55,480
after dinner Frank<font color="#E5E5E5"> Akamai just two</font>

1880
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:58,420
seconds a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments that have been</font>

1881
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:02,019
made here that one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1882
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">really valuable work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too it is dubiously</font>

1883
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">in scope for this working group and that</font>

1884
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:10,090
three there is going there is probably

1885
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:11,379
enough work to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> on support</font>

1886
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:15,730
infrastructure connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this practical</font>

1887
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:19,360
practical to to merit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> knopf another</font>

1888
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:22,299
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I'd actually argue that</font>

1889
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,190
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mechanics of code</font>

1890
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,050
signing is totally orthogonal to this

1891
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:28,299
we're talking about arbitrary binary

1892
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:29,650
blobs here and we aren't you know we

1893
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:33,310
aren't assuming anything about the

1894
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:35,170
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure of these blobs so you</font>

1895
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:40,210
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is if we've got a blob</font>

1896
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:41,980
of data how do we how do we log it so so

1897
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:43,840
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually different from the</font>

1898
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,879
motivational side that Franklin is

1899
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking right Frank stalks is suggesting</font>

1900
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,620
that the goal of this is just is to

1901
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:52,720
ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not running some</font>

1902
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,160
random version of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1903
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,260
done issues that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something more</font>

1904
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,420
than just random binary clock yeah it

1905
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:00,940
implies you need at least identifier for

1906
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:03,039
a product and there is not yeah but

1907
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,568
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not those do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

1908
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:09,039
anything about the signing mechanism a

1909
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:11,019
date that's right yeah so um anyway I

1910
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:13,119
you know the main things that we wanted

1911
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:15,549
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask a couple of questions about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1912
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:17,709
number one is their interest in seeing

1913
01:26:15,549 --> 01:26:22,869
this work go forward in the ITF even if

1914
01:26:17,709 --> 01:26:27,869
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen here huh if yes hum if</font>

1915
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:29,768
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this interest in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this work um</font>

1916
01:26:27,869 --> 01:26:31,419
second question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about the</font>

1917
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">applicability of this draft or the</font>

1918
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:37,809
appropriateness of this draft for

1919
01:26:32,799 --> 01:26:39,909
adoption by somebody so hum if yes this

1920
01:26:37,809 --> 01:26:44,379
is a suitable draft for using as a basis

1921
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:49,919
for this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hum if it's not a</font>

1922
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:52,510
suitable basis for the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

1923
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:56,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you that that helps clarify</font>

1924
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:58,599
some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um is there anything</font>

1925
01:26:56,049 --> 01:27:03,089
else afraid we don't have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1926
01:26:58,599 --> 01:27:03,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to savas additional discussion but</font>

1927
01:27:09,839 --> 01:27:19,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll see you on</font>

1928
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:19,108
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list oh that was interesting</font>

1929
01:27:25,469 --> 01:27:28,469
reshoots
