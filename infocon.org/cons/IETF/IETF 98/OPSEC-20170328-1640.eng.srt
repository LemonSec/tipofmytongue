19
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,069
pretty important so next time we will

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,599
get a large bigger room right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

28
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,450
that quite often we have a draft that

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,970
are doing some operational and security

also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another active document that</font>

improvement in short it has mainly been

71
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,270
discussed on the grow a working group

72
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,250
because that's again something which is

73
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,590
crossing to working groups but in short

74
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,080
is about we all know about unicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PF</font>

75
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,500
check in strict mode and one in loose

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,570
mode this proposed something in the

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">middle there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IHG</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">determiners</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> files either so first</font>

80
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,280
session is<font color="#CCCCCC"> soooo RS here</font>

81
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are you yeah we'll miss you so so I</font>

82
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:30,180
would present a briefly it's a draft

83
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:35,130
about the security environments for I to

84
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:38,360
RS well I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font>

85
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,370
presented here so we can with a few well

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,590
well so it's not a protocol requirements

87
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">but only about the environment so visit</font>

88
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:50,039
leads providing some requirements some

89
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,310
attention when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to deploy</font>

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,230
I to RS so we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> with 37 requirements</font>

91
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,930
most of well we can divide that into

92
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:06,570
three categories isolation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

93
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:09,690
management and the remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stem we</font>

94
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:13,980
have inter<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane isolation for access</font>

95
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:20,910
control and for application i trow

96
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:24,180
recitations so are you aware of the I

97
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,790
Torres architecture I think it would be

98
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">better to make a refresh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:36,960
basically you have applications that are

100
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,550
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one hrs client and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

101
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,120
have multiple applications and the

102
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,880
clients is providing is a communicating

103
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,690
to the IRS agent which is in SAS to

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:53,580
update the ruling states of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

105
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:59,000
plane so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so you have the</font>

106
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:02,310
application the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agent and</font>

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,010
well an important thing is that you can

108
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">have multiple applications to 10 to 1</font>

109
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,840
nitro rest client which means that

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,190
the agent they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really see which</font>

111
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:26,190
application is providing some

112
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:28,260
instructions so so well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

113
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,900
can with different planes one which is

114
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data plane the control plane and the</font>

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,750
manager plane so one of them some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

116
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,390
requirements are but to isolate all this

117
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:44,790
plane and this is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention about</font>

118
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itrs architecture so you can have</font>

119
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,170
multiple applications connected to one

120
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,900
client but you can also have one client

121
00:08:49,170 --> 00:09:01,020
connected to multiple agents so you have

122
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:04,020
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compostable combinations so when</font>

123
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,360
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirements are because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

124
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,660
can well you have all these interactions

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,360
so some of the requirements are which

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,400
application are buying to which i trow

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,820
rest client and so on which I tour is

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,770
lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so some of the requirements as</font>

129
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,589
well if you clustering all these

130
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,839
applications and well you should cluster

131
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,550
them according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the privilege</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

132
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:32,970
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have multiple applications that</font>

133
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,500
can access to a given client and they

134
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same kind of privilege</font>

135
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:44,420
then you can easily well you can easily

136
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:47,880
leak well end up into a privilege

137
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:52,949
escalation situation so that's the

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:58,339
reason we asked to to cluster the

139
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,339
applications according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the privileges</font>

140
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:32,630
so that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said um yeah why</font>

141
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:32,630
so um that's all about the escalation um

142
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:48,240
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time there was only 15</font>

143
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:51,120
side which was quite short so I don't

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are any questions so</font>

145
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:02,040
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time now nothing</font>

146
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevents you to tell more and strictly</font>

147
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:10,050
one thing that's interesting for me it's

148
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:13,530
oh you provision everything so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

149
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:20,819
would provision that as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of</font>

150
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:23,010
the management and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't</font>

151
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,830
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link with security so well</font>

152
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:32,790
basically you would like to avoid the

153
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:36,240
situation where 110 anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how</font>

154
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:39,660
we provision<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so is the question how</font>

155
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,550
we we maintain that the different tenet

156
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:49,439
remains isolated or because maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

157
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:52,020
help you out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that okay sorry I yes</font>

158
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:58,280
I had the wrong time so in many cases

159
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:58,280
when we provision these pieces right

160
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:06,870
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is the context this slide</font>

161
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">in general pardon in general oh and</font>

162
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:14,320
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so remember this is all in</font>

163
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the context of the IRA to say</font>

164
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,030
and the alternate data stores the

165
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:24,370
artists agent is a dynamic control plane

166
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:29,199
that that uses net compressed comp and

167
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:34,420
so our initial protocol that's doing

168
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,790
general provisioning talks to a piece of

169
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,150
software on the router or the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

170
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,520
it basically says do these things so

171
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,949
that's a provisioning agent which you

172
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,980
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of just like netcom press comp</font>

173
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:51,250
because we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using our protocol to use</font>

174
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,950
his rest comp our data models are data

175
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,400
models but they can exist in a new data

176
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:59,530
plane called a from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the revised</font>

177
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,939
data stored data plane it's a control

178
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,569
plane data plate so when you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

179
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:09,010
you'll see several times<font color="#E5E5E5"> itrs the</font>

180
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:11,140
security piece here is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when</font>

181
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,870
you have that protocol agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

182
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,420
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a net comp server that's</font>

183
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,240
sitting on a box that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an</font>

184
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,750
implementation and that implementation

185
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,330
has some extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how you</font>

186
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,120
actually implemented it you have the net

187
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,990
com server client environment it's just

188
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,030
the server to disambiguate it from the

189
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:39,040
control plane use is called the r2s

190
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:43,480
agent this ancillary security that this

191
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,569
draft references is really the is the

192
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,940
notes to the implementers which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel</font>

193
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:54,490
started with that says this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

194
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,310
think you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do when you write on</font>

195
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">it they're written is requirements in</font>

196
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,880
the draft but there really a suggestion

197
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,470
of helpful things that you requirements

198
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,689
in the sense please these are good

199
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:12,550
things if you want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure things</font>

200
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:14,290
don't have security problems they're not

201
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,060
the type of requirements like you'd have

202
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,490
on the restaurant protocol that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

203
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,160
whole other spec this is just these

204
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,960
would be really good things if you think

205
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,219
that we should release restate them as

206
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,199
these are general<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good good</font>

207
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,300
ideas we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as you know</font>

208
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,889
these are really a list of really good

209
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,990
things but I'm sure Daniel would have

210
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,779
said that in the beginning if I hadn't

211
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:41,860
did we answer the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you yeah</font>

212
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:46,360
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you any other questions from the</font>

213
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:50,410
room mate with the church permission may

214
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,240
ask a question there's this is to the

215
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,449
room is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of thing that you</font>

216
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,129
want to hear about in obstet is this are

217
00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:00,689
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as we get new</font>

218
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,689
protocols that are useful for you

219
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:06,879
anybody think this is really good you

220
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,149
want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the future ask for</font>

221
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,040
hammer maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> death more discreet right</font>

222
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:15,009
so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the question twice of</font>

223
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,800
course first one who thing it was useful

224
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,120
to get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of discussion here and</font>

225
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">would think it's a waste</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time just to</font>

226
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,670
be brutal right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here knowing so let's go</font>

227
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,519
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hem who's saying that this kind</font>

228
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:35,589
of presentation specifically this one

229
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:37,000
it's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> please am now so the people</font>

230
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:41,620
that think that it's a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,550
again to be brutal please home now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

232
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay thank you Thank You Daniel</font>

233
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,670
thank you to thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> my girl for doing</font>

234
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,670
it

235
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,930
so next one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mary Kay I seen you enter</font>

236
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,150
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you see I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quarter</font>

237
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:20,250
so we have only<font color="#CCCCCC"> one chairman alright</font>

238
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:29,310
let's begin there for a wife got a

239
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:32,370
clicker thing here here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on TV hello so</font>

240
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:35,550
um this is a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three of us</font>

241
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">erica kk myself started about four years</font>

242
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:42,109
ago and part of it was because with the

243
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,370
v6 security all of the the

244
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,050
recommendations and you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

245
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was in about a hundred</font>

246
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,060
different RFC's so we decided probably

247
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,590
better to create one single document so

248
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,209
that if somebody was looking at how do

249
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,730
you secure v6 and what are the

250
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,490
considerations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had one document</font>

251
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,350
to look at and we created<font color="#CCCCCC"> a synopsis so</font>

252
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,710
that's kind of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impetus of why</font>

253
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:07,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> workout started we are at revision</font>

254
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,750
10 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to show some of the</font>

255
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">latest updates there was some</font>

256
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,599
considerable review done by some folks

257
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the v6 ops community and so we're</font>

258
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,119
very grateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thankful for that so</font>

259
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,230
there was some threads<font color="#CCCCCC"> june of last year</font>

260
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,089
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that led to a bunch of fixes</font>

261
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,210
primarily it was fixing grammar issues

262
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,659
and spelling errors adding links to

263
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,670
provide more explicit references also

264
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">being consistent with uppercase and</font>

265
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,480
lowercase cases used for acronyms we

266
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,040
corrected a reference in some sections

267
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,170
and we updated all the references

268
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,450
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graphs keep getting</font>

269
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,850
updated obviously or some that turned

270
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,610
into our seas in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four years that</font>

271
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,889
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this document and</font>

272
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:59,159
we also finally added some explicit

273
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:04,080
language to replace some of the dvds and

274
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:07,380
so specifically then the extension

275
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,330
header so we added some text on on how

276
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,120
to handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what to what considerations</font>

277
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,370
are should be for extension headers um

278
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,409
the first bullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> point i think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

279
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,929
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's a herd mentality</font>

280
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,630
in terms of drop every packet that has

281
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,180
an extension header that is not

282
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,200
practical and so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that</font>

283
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,660
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> offhand so we added explicit</font>

284
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,480
texts show that extension headers are

285
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,700
used in operational networks and so you

286
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,670
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about you know are</font>

287
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do you need them right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

288
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,830
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about should you be dropping</font>

289
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:48,280
some of them or or not and then what

290
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,830
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you do so we first list some</font>

291
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,800
operational aspects and primarily it's

292
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,470
the ipsec either a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extension</font>

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,450
headers or fragmentation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really</font>

294
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,570
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think carefully about power</font>

295
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,179
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not there are utilized we</font>

296
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about order and repetition on the</font>

297
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,080
hop by hop extension header which has

298
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,899
some dost eagles<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects for</font>

299
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,290
consideration and then the fragmentation

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,410
extension header because some specific

301
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:22,990
fragments could cause stateless

302
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:25,210
filtering bypass so we also added

303
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,880
language works to external security

304
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,740
considerations so specifically a

305
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,530
language to address current work in

306
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,530
progress for extension header filtering

307
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,510
as well as a new language in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

308
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,370
specific draft so we have the reference

309
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,250
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft it's actually a draft in</font>

310
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,379
this working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font>

311
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text I think you can read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

312
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,490
yourself but we added that to be more

313
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,710
explicit and of course up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> date with</font>

314
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,230
all the current work and considerations

315
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:57,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to think about in securing</font>

316
00:19:53,230 --> 00:20:00,190
v6 networks so next steps we want to

317
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,760
thank Marcus and Fred who provided

318
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:07,059
extensive information and comments back

319
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,710
in June 2016 and we would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

320
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:11,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the working group whether or not this</font>

321
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,850
document is ready for last<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall those</font>

322
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,740
pictures were taking at eight in the

323
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,840
morning when we met for breakfast to

324
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,690
finalize these slides and going are we

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">done yet and on those of you that might</font>

326
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,840
know me is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a morning person at</font>

327
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,690
all so I am 55 this morning it was

328
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,090
fabulous

329
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,400
yeah I'm always late in the mornings but

330
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,530
anyway so yes so that's that's it for

331
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
the presentation part and we would like

332
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,730
to solicit you know feedback as to

333
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:45,720
whether or not folks think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

334
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:54,570
Stockton was ready for last call how

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:56,220
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you read the document yeah game</font>

336
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,799
date so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started his journey like</font>

337
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,450
about like four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and I think it</font>

338
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">is about time to start thinking about</font>

339
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know closing this piece of work so</font>

340
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,330
also in on the previous time we got it

341
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,340
we already you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know came to the</font>

342
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,070
conclusion that you know that we were

343
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,320
going to work upon a lot of last call

344
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,510
for this off the document was updated

345
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,270
now that took<font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

346
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,830
group lost all never happened so right

347
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:28,049
now at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time you know they</font>

348
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:30,570
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that talking is ready we</font>

349
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">have as the authors do I mean we had</font>

350
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,389
some life you know happen but it's it's

351
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,549
an and we didn't even really plan to all

352
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,280
three be here at this meeting but it

353
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:44,668
just so happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so but we do feel</font>

354
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,610
like it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for last call we you</font>

355
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:51,510
know it's a document where as new things

356
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:54,360
come up it can last forever but we feel

357
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:58,080
like right now its current to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state</font>

358
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,090
of where things are now and um so yeah

359
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,790
as office we feel it's very for last

360
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,040
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then I question middle to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

361
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,540
through the room itself here so like

362
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,460
anybody objecting if you actually would

363
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,659
start a lost ball from like let's say

364
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of next week somewhere</font>

365
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,630
nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then next little mistake we</font>

366
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Builder we're looking at La Scala</font>

367
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,020
new document any other time

368
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:33,340
so next<font color="#E5E5E5"> section is Bernie if we talk</font>

369
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how to secure the link between dtp</font>

370
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:48,100
related to the server stand and I think

371
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:50,190
blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so this a draft is</font>

372
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,800
actually in the DC working group and

373
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:57,130
basically it updates let me go to the

374
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide it updates some of the text</font>

375
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,150
in some of the existing documents

376
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:10,240
because during on the ice iesg review of

377
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:12,540
RC 78 39 they<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise some issues because</font>

378
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the nature of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that was being</font>

379
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,550
exchanged um they were you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're</font>

380
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,560
holding up this document which just

381
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,169
added some new relay options and we kind

382
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,000
of said well you know this isn't fair to

383
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,620
really block this because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

384
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,480
of other relay options that have similar

385
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,389
problems and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we don't really</font>

386
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any strong security between it and</font>

387
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,870
typically you know this isn't usually in

388
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:42,250
an operational inside operators network

389
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:44,350
where there hopefully protecting it you

390
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,970
know their their internal networks in

391
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:51,310
good ways I mean if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can snoop the</font>

392
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,780
relay traffic and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know relate to</font>

393
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,780
server communication they can probably

394
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,680
some other things so we got them to to

395
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,170
let us proceed but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take on</font>

396
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,450
the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> of improving the security</font>

397
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:10,300
between the relay agents and the dhcp

398
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:13,470
server and just as a background RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2131</font>

399
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:16,389
which is the gcp v4 specification

400
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,800
doesn't have any mechanism for security

401
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:24,010
RC 33 16 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dhcpv6</font>

402
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,260
specification does but it's only a you

403
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,410
know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a must or anything like</font>

404
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,490
that it says you you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> however</font>

405
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:36,370
it also doesn't provide any

406
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,880
authentication sorry any and encryption

407
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,590
for the communication

408
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,750
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of says you know you don't</font>

409
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">need it because most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data isn't</font>

410
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:49,590
that that important to secure obviously

411
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:54,540
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> have changed since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

412
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,760
written so this draft proposes and then

413
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:02,310
you know it's now as you'll see it's

414
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:05,910
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg must use IPSec for DHCP v4</font>

415
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:10,110
and dhcpv6 relay to relay or real age a

416
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:12,450
server communication you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this</font>

417
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,240
stuff is out there so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

418
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,710
deal for us to require this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also</font>

419
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,710
require encryption as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

420
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,380
really changes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dhcpv6</font>

421
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:29,970
specification really changes the you may

422
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:33,450
use it into a must and also adds the

423
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:36,210
encryption so you know here are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

424
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,360
the IPSec details they must use it they

425
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:42,180
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> use encryption we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well well</font>

426
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,530
we say you can use manually configured

427
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:50,460
keys we really prefer people to use you

428
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:53,760
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP to step and and use either</font>

429
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,470
pre shared secrets and hopefully even in

430
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:02,460
full public key stuff the current status

431
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,520
is it has passed the working group last

433
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,480
the IETF last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ended there were</font>

434
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:17,520
two reviews by jen art and the security

435
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,870
and it's scheduled for tell a chat on

436
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,990
the 413 call<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the iesg so hopefully</font>

437
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,570
it will get approved but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

438
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:31,260
comments questions or concerns you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

439
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:37,100
you can let let the ad in the room know

440
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,100
or let let me know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can work on</font>

441
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:46,139
any difference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brittany because the</font>

442
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,890
finish right I'm Dennis<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah any</font>

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions for Bernie</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great i ate a f-1 not mine you</font>

445
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,889
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use from dhcp relay to</font>

446
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:02,430
server a destination which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ada</font>

447
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:06,060
multicast or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> test then you need</font>

448
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">video I and not I for doing it oh let me</font>

449
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:14,010
something so um you know you there is

450
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,230
the ability to configure multicast

451
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,570
addresses for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relay forwarding</font>

452
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,080
addresses or potentially anycast address

453
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,970
or whatever obviously there there may be

454
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,689
some and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't really mention</font>

455
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,920
those issues in the draft if you you

456
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make use of some of those</font>

457
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">things if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have those you know</font>

458
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,449
if you're using pre shared secrets or

459
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,290
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> mesa continue to work but you</font>

460
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,580
know depending on what you're using

461
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:43,710
there may be some issues and it is maybe

462
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,310
I didn't get your phone but my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

463
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,680
is as far as I remember I v2 works only

464
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,990
from unicast address to unicast address

465
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,450
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending traffic comunicarse</font>

466
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,040
to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast already cast so angry too</font>

467
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,650
will not work in this concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

468
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,830
typically typically the most people

469
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,780
don't use the multi casting or the any

470
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,010
casting capabilities for real a

471
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,170
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean most of the</font>

472
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">operators I know configure unicast</font>

473
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:13,080
addresses for that communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

474
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,240
and they can do that because the relay

475
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,139
agents have the ability to forward it on

476
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,810
to multiple destinations ok so for

477
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,090
protocols like the DCP failover and

478
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,470
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can configure the</font>

479
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,570
relay to send it to multiple

480
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,640
destinations and when the packet sent

481
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,260
out they will duplicate the packet to

482
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,150
those destinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then a</font>

483
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,830
suggestion that needs to say the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

484
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:40,230
only when the relay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my dress is</font>

485
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:45,500
physically unicast yeah maybe there is

486
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:48,510
something that that will need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to</font>

487
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,910
address that issue or question or put

488
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,320
the restriction on that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

489
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,750
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

490
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,889
cannot use the multicast or any casting

491
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,300
I mean any casting might still work<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

492
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,630
I've you know I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred sure</font>

493
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:11,120
that what the issues there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

494
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other questions okay next</font>

495
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:21,830
person is<font color="#CCCCCC"> jerome pascua we talked about</font>

496
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">this serious question for us about dots</font>

497
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:29,399
signaling vos of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 probably well</font>

498
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,700
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the introduction so this</font>

499
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,140
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we propose with my</font>

500
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,240
colleague Adele today I'm a client

501
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Giovanni and first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all I want to</font>

502
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,390
thank you but invitation to present in

503
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,670
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so yes so the CID year is</font>

504
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,040
so we are involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the dots working</font>

505
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,200
group where the goal of course is to

506
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,670
basically provide a mechanism signaling

507
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,890
mechanism between aliens k on<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

508
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,680
basically no there is not a cat the US

509
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:03,660
attack and a server which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would figure a</font>

510
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:09,690
mitigation part so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its rays easy cute</font>

511
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:12,960
chief of the dots so of course there is

512
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,610
a real different purpose than<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Z</font>

513
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:21,140
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with adults for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the signaling</font>

514
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:23,719
part with for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the dtls for</font>

515
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,450
communicating as a reason attack and

516
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,600
what we propose is not a purely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

517
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,780
signaling mechanism we want to position

518
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,520
our press as a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of backup mechanism</font>

519
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,960
because these achieve your energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

520
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,690
attack maybe you network is congested

521
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,920
and you want to pass a signal to send a

522
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,750
signal that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are enjoy that but</font>

523
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,760
cannot go because yes simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

524
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,160
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a congested so our idea is</font>

525
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:52,170
that we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to benefit from</font>

526
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,910
already existing and foreign packet into

527
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,700
the network to embed some information

528
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,260
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it's like when you are put</font>

529
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sss message in the bottle in the</font>

530
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,629
senator ocean so it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically</font>

531
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,790
we will not necessarily XD a regular

532
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,700
cross between the can't server but we

533
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:11,340
try to benefit from we get also if you

534
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,420
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> that further I'm glad prospective</font>

535
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,280
less random random wall can graph and so

536
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,160
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exist</font>

537
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,300
oxy are mechanisms so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to impact</font>

538
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,430
occur in the first instance of the

539
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,600
attack we are colleagues are observers

540
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:29,040
are still some packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> are adult to be</font>

541
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,629
forwarded and we want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

542
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,570
vintage to put information and we we are

543
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,850
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the hop I of mechanism</font>

544
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:42,050
Africa physics can be a good solution

545
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:44,520
because it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we try to</font>

546
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:48,270
basically replicate this information

547
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:52,470
into not all but many abuses packet data

548
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">format so it's kind yes of what you say</font>

549
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,450
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in comp artistic manner because we</font>

550
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,179
will not for example when we initiate

551
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,370
the process will not put information

552
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,840
from a package that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key into</font>

553
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">a server but from package that and</font>

554
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,889
basically goes well if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ain't on also</font>

555
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,450
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and so on okay it</font>

556
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:14,820
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just replicated at some point</font>

557
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,100
but yeah just maybe a figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 to</font>

558
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,780
explain so why what we have a year we

559
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,899
have of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Anthony servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

560
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,899
want to the giant went to say that there

561
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an attack on going we also get</font>

562
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,280
windows so gateway to be very brief is

563
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,250
kind of intermediate that the clan can

564
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,670
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you thinking it can</font>

565
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,990
use before<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacting the server so the</font>

566
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea that the giant wants to connect</font>

567
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">aces several directly as a gateway ok</font>

568
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,040
this is the common basis that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we you</font>

569
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,840
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add no adults and then</font>

570
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,060
what we on the network we we propose to

571
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,600
have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a capable Roger power</font>

572
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,240
option so meaning that of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

573
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be initially initiated by the client</font>

574
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client will embed information some</font>

575
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecosys are doing packet or maybe create</font>

576
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,720
some at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin of course the</font>

577
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,010
spaghetti laughs we lives on their own

578
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,500
and then this week coaching uses but

579
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:16,740
then for each also packets a good go for

580
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,250
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> on as you can see for when arise</font>

581
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,410
a capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ritter also packet that pass</font>

582
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,810
by can be then also marked with this

583
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so basically this capital</font>

584
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,260
richer<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just start kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

585
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,199
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US</font>

586
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,990
the attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will encapsulate this</font>

587
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">information to the world so that's a</font>

588
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:42,670
principle<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I think in the earlier</font>

589
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,800
slide about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop by hop option I</font>

590
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,180
think there's an assertion in your

591
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,800
document that those are actually

592
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:53,440
processed by the most routers it should

593
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,389
each you so we can you yeah I think

594
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an assertion in your draft that</font>

595
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:00,910
the hop by hop option is actually

596
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,250
processed by most routers not<font color="#CCCCCC"> literally</font>

597
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:23,050
you don't say that i'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

598
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:26,110
do jholi<font color="#E5E5E5"> egli yeah so you said it</font>

599
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:29,740
utilizes the ipv6 hop-by-hop app should

600
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,780
header RFC 2460 this header has the

601
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,908
advantage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fully inspected by all</font>

602
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,750
network devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is the first header</font>

603
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:41,169
in the ipv6 extension headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

604
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:46,480
that assertion is unlikely to be held

605
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:49,270
true since I'm unaware of any basic

606
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,699
based router that honors<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot by hop</font>

607
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:59,290
options by default yeah we know we know

608
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:00,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then you should probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font>

609
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,620
that assertion from the drive yeah but

610
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:06,040
maybe maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus the first day of</font>

611
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,140
Russian we<font color="#CCCCCC"> deem it but yeah yeah yeah</font>

612
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that yeah we suppose that I really sound</font>

613
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,069
that canon del well of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> in depends</font>

614
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,560
on the number too much 12 sibilities

615
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,640
yeah so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had do for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

616
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,140
honored us by sending them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

617
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,160
software forwarding plane I would never

618
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:27,040
do that because well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Doss yeah</font>

619
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,069
and also um ok our assumption is that

620
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,830
first you're already on those so I think

621
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be yeah you think I cannot</font>

622
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:38,020
be more dust because that absolutely

623
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,880
happens to me every day which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

624
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">get some and then I get some more and</font>

625
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,230
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I get more so</font>

626
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,049
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think anything that actually</font>

627
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:53,980
increases my costs of processing packets

628
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:56,288
when I'm under attack is definitely

629
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,180
putting me in a worse situation yeah but

630
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,339
depends who you authorized to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so I</font>

631
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:03,339
mean we didn't see that every plans of

632
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:05,019
customs network can do it's only you

633
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:07,359
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of present in client and</font>

634
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:09,490
server I mean it doesn't means that for

635
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,910
example for a nice visit every single

636
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:15,508
user can send this options it's really

637
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:18,670
specific one well it's specific to

638
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:20,740
directionality right because I either

639
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:27,250
have to process hop-by-hop attractions

640
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:29,229
on input or I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if if I'm</font>

641
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,029
going to honor a hop by hop option like

642
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going to</font>

643
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:36,670
authorize you to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i already have</font>

644
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,660
to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the header exists yeah yeah</font>

645
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:42,609
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like the only way that I could</font>

646
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,649
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically is that my</font>

647
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,319
ingress ACL would be on a per interface

648
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,720
basis because otherwise i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,519
parse the header yeah what took into

650
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,569
some so I've already I've already

651
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:58,000
incurred the expense basically before I

652
00:36:55,569 --> 00:37:03,970
decide what the IP address of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font>

653
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,940
is yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it don't exist like</font>

654
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,009
this is like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean sending the</font>

655
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,349
information upstream i think is like a

656
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:14,109
worthwhile thought experiment and how to

657
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:17,079
do that is pretty important but like

658
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:24,788
hop-by-hop sounds like a pretty scary

659
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:27,819
way to do that to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay while I'm not</font>

660
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">told enough or on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kamari so I have</font>

661
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:34,089
similar concerns if I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

662
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,788
careful and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't strip these out on</font>

663
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:38,349
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my edge or gateway I'm now going</font>

664
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:40,990
to be signaling to everybody that hey

665
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:42,789
I'm under attack and i'm also not really

666
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,129
careful and don't filter them on ingress

667
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:46,599
this seems like an ideal thing for

668
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,119
people to happily insert into the

669
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,460
packets when they're sending me now

670
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,069
think you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful on</font>

671
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,079
the policy well yeah or what Jack said

672
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,690
was young ingress perfect that's for

673
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font>

674
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,810
this is the basic ed Caesar so points

675
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,670
that you are no addressing Robin it's a

676
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,859
practical consideration if you want to

677
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,390
deploy such solutions and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as oh</font>

678
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:10,400
yes we present here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wouldn't it's a</font>

679
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-man as well to add more feedback</font>

680
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:20,569
really so yeah we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> about option</font>

681
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:24,020
is really an issue for a practical

682
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:27,890
perspective so then we that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> y and z</font>

683
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:30,020
mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask if real experiments if</font>

684
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:33,970
people really experiment it in there are

685
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:38,540
some feedbacks on other proposals accuse

686
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:41,000
abaya<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiction is a success on that so</font>

687
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,790
yes we are people to get all those this

688
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,349
kind of feedback but Anya borrowed

689
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:52,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">wealth but also dwells i tried to use</font>

690
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:56,210
and that's apparently face so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

691
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue okay so then we of course you</font>

692
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:02,180
have to we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mark all packets you</font>

693
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,759
have to kind of you need some decision

694
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,290
about the brackets for mark this is you

695
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,420
are proposing something simple in<font color="#CCCCCC"> zagreb</font>

696
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:12,130
but of course is asked to be defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

697
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:15,319
its as a user I mean house GOP<font color="#CCCCCC"> writers</font>

698
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:18,170
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> package should be marked of course I</font>

699
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,880
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mark all in the first instance</font>

700
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,310
of the attack to add more chances and

701
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,780
decrease the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of packets remark do</font>

702
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:29,089
not overall the network as as as we say

703
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before but this of course is</font>

704
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:33,290
open how you define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we don't say and</font>

705
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:37,578
that we will define and we say that

706
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:39,050
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one way to find okay by</font>

707
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:42,560
the way if you enter click on you back

708
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,890
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backs previous line number one</font>

709
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:54,849
email michael marking or any task packet

710
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:54,848
of something<font color="#CCCCCC"> either do</font>

711
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,170
yet this one point number four that's no

712
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you can detect whether the</font>

713
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,510
destination is any caste or not it's

714
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,010
said by very specific configuration

715
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,990
because there is no difference between

716
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,030
anycast address in the unicast address

717
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,859
so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the configuration</font>

718
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,420
that tells this unique address is

719
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,640
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new cast and so on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

720
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:28,700
on not a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just beware of</font>

721
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:31,279
this right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you okay so</font>

722
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:34,040
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are we on k teaches in cutting</font>

723
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,440
absorption so of course we have some

724
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,940
fields which will be some feel you

725
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,070
should be use a fixed line<font color="#CCCCCC"> metals or</font>

726
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">wise with variable length so we have Cal</font>

727

728
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:49,880
option so nothing special here so maybe

729
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,970
as an example cross me encanta different

730
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,050
types of information the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's you</font>

731
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:59,419
want to reach or for triggering the

736
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,710
included in CR in the option of course

737
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:17,870
we have also<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of TTL that</font>

738
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,850

740
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:28,819
regarding no deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> consideration as</font>

00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already discussed yeah I very</font>

742
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:37,910
attractive because yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll buy option</font>

743
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:41,480
is usually what we arrived that so the

744
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:44,600
idea is that our place our rationale is

745
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,510
that this optionally used by another I

746
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,270
mean every everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really under</font>

00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:52,340
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for a circle of trust between</font>

748
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:57,160

750
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,480
of course we don't because<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the dots</font>

751
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,820
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> already some scenarios that we</font>

752
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">described with different domains we are</font>

753
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,869

759
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,480
will leave me to this a use case

760
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:29,570
basically and okay so then of course you

761
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,040
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modify some kind of treatment</font>

back that that it can be considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

773
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:02,060
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not aware that further impacts</font>

774
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:04,129
will investigate its this issue you

775
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,680
should use preceptors are using advanced

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuit API okay because we have also</font>

777
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,720
started the implementation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

778
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,640
are currently are doing it so I mean

779
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:20,000
humans will have some proof of concept

780
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so I think you have followed</font>

781
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,200
some conversation and the mailing list

782
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Xia should we offer eyes on that</font>

783
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,470
finger in section it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered can</font>

784
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,900
be considered as I'm full so it has to

785
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,669
be done in a very careful mud as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

786
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss already bit you can use</font>

787
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:44,240
encapsulated mode or in our case as I

788
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:46,220
say we should I will target basically in

789
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,060
fredonia so at least we should say that

790
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:52,310
in the Lexington ISIL networks you

791
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,200
should know what RZR possibly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

792
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:57,980
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example regarding MTU and so on and</font>

793
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,169
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be able to UM to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> select if</font>

794
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,090
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on earth let's say insert data</font>

795
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,790
of course all the deployment push nice

796
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,190
and also sakr of the world the work

797
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">arduino on the on all main thinking now</font>

798
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:16,940
to address them properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah I</font>

799
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,970
think I mean and then of course yes be

800
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,880
able to see page consideration in the

801
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">grass off</font>

802
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,289
need to kind of checking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> C key and</font>

803
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:32,009
she's really offer I ski and to do so as

804
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:34,500
we stayed we should limit who can first

805
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:38,339
initiate the process by creating the

806
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">first packet and okay we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

807
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:48,049
signature that should use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and verify the</font>

808
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:50,368
identity at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server side then and</font>

809
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:53,069
basically that's it first critical such

810
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:56,059
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> battle main focus here is marble or we</font>

811
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:59,549
can actually practically deploy it and

812
00:44:56,059 --> 00:45:02,430
yes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ready to have any feedback</font>

813
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:05,400
about that and I mean about yoga but as

814
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:08,700
i said earlier but other people that is

815
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,589
a from that purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> graph using her</font>

816
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:15,750
bio pezuela try to do some experiment is

817
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:19,680
about one ok any questions margin

818
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:22,319
hormone and genuine cover actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

819
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,210
like when people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find useful</font>

820
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications for extension campus right</font>

821
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,589
we need a killer up so people start

822
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:32,308
using them however I do have concerns

823
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:34,740
here first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it's been side you</font>

824
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:38,130
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> admitted us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your dragon traffic</font>

825
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,689
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you insert and header which increase</font>

826
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,880
the probability of this traffic to<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

827
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,640
dropped right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the measurements</font>

828
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,740
we've done shows that routers do drop

829
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,930
packets with this extension header right

830
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:54,629
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you making the situation</font>

831
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:58,049
for the traffickers and second concern

832
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,940
about us header insertion I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

833
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:01,920
not very concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> em to you</font>

834
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,859
because if it's your demand you probably

835
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:11,490
know your empty you however what do you

836
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:13,140
do if you need to send icmp back yeah so

837
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,390
do you want your router to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

838
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and resources on removing the</font>

839
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">hanger and sends a packet back as it</font>

840
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:23,129
enters your domain or what you said

841
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,049
trying to do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay aphoristic</font>

842
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,269
encryption actually we didn't really

843
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:33,869
I'll think about it yet so thank you for

844
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:34,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the feedback i have no yeah maybe we</font>

845
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:38,970
just we

846
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:42,330
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> kieren so no I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you have to but</font>

847
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jen if you don't mind if you are again</font>

848
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,340
if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> under dose you will never</font>

849
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:51,120
send an ICMP back yet other things to do

850
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:53,280
though I'm not sure this particular

851
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,200
router might not be actually under those

852
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,420
right what we're doing when just a

853
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,490
problem probably since the scenario here

854
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,590
but we have a client which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the</font>

855
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">doors then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sent packet and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fake</font>

856
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it might probably not necessarily going</font>

857
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,520
through overloaded router and the router

858
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:12,660
probably practicing this packet and for

859
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">example hope leave it is now 0 right so</font>

860
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,089
we need to send icmp black oh we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

861
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,890
send icing they become some other ISM

862
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,300
and let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> router does have</font>

863
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,710
resources to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this because he has</font>

864
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,890
otherwise indeed it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just</font>

865
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,450
silently<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw so we either sending some</font>

866
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,609
strange make it back and client who<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

867
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,970
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

868
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">additional resources on crafting</font>

869
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">inverted and back to our original site</font>

870
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:40,770
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be tricky right thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you oh</font>

871
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,630
yeah thank you crazy cause if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

872
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think yeah regarding you yeah first</font>

873
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:48,330
mention i think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the same</font>

874
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:52,740
should we regarding resources should we

875
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:54,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe ok we know that if we provide</font>

876
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,819
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right that's for sure I mean we</font>

877
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:59,850
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even sit in the bath</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know but</font>

878
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:03,090
yes i did that we try to find a solution

879
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:05,160
that charbel to to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> your signaling</font>

880
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:08,580
before you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> let her do and then</font>

881
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,259
it's for it late so sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just briefly</font>

882
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,420
read the draft what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am not sure</font>

883
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,660
exactly what you want the routers to do

884
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,590
when these sizzles hop-by-hop hiders

885
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,870
because I understand you trying to

886
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,430
signal something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the server what the</font>

887
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:24,509
what the routers are supposed to do

888
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:26,399
let's say my intermediate router

889
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:30,570
receives a packet is called by home yeah

890
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:34,110
what the actions are supposed to let's

891
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:37,620
say stores information and in bed

892
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:39,390
information all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

893
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you say we like is not</font>

894
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,839
necessary to use the passwords can be

895
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,560
congested by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack potatoes or pass</font>

896
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,150
in a kind of opportunistic manner so jet

897
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,720
it with a thousand server or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

898
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,950
gateway

899
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,390
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some assumption is that you</font>

900
00:48:49,950 --> 00:49:02,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">should add more get me into the network</font>

901
00:48:51,390 --> 00:49:06,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can send me later 27 okay and the</font>

902
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,890
question comes around Oh anything by the

903
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,270
way job I don't know whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

904
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:15,779
the in situ Oh am working group which is

905
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:22,680
doing kind of things vaguely related you

906
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:27,840
may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insecure iom but ok</font>

907
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:30,089
next speaker is switch advance we will

908
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,859
talk without slides which is quite

909
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:35,070
unusual<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the idea but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a</font>

910
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:37,020
good performance about acne<font color="#E5E5E5"> exfilling</font>

911
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is it the architecture and then</font>

912
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually on this my opinion very</font>

913
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,440
important protocol

914
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:55,460
hi I'm Richard Barnes raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

915
00:49:51,980 --> 00:50:02,240
you've heard of acne already<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great</font>

916
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:05,450
all right we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks okay so i'm</font>

917
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,560
directing my my vision to you so we had

918
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,259
this problem in the web for a while

919
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,660
where you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all the</font>

920
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,520
websites encrypted but in order for

921
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a website to be encrypted it's</font>

922
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,550
got to have a certificate to prove its

923
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:20,930
identity and for ages the process of

924
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,360
getting a certificate and provisioning

925
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:27,140
it's a web server was an entirely manual

926
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,450
or mostly manual process so acne was an

927
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,069
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate the provisioning</font>

928
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,470
certificate within the management of

929
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,900
certificates so that we could have

930
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:38,180
automated certificate provisioning stuff

931
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,830
and scale up but the encryption of the

932
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">web so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology that</font>

933
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,540
underlies let's and crepes that was kind

934
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,190
of the first use case for it we

935
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed the first version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of acne to</font>

936
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,790
get what some crepes started but the

937
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,440
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the working group here is to</font>

938
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,080
expand that out and so to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

939
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,900
suitable for<font color="#E5E5E5"> use with other cas and get</font>

940
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,640
the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki that serves the web and</font>

941
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,690
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet applications upgrated</font>

942
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:06,080
automatable so the primary use case that

943
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:09,020
acne addresses is this case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS based</font>

944
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,740
certificates so you know websites

945
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:16,040
authenticate their domain names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

946
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:18,319
acne provides mechanisms for the an

947
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,090
applicant for a certificate to first

948
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,740
request a certificate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> show up at the</font>

949
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:24,800
CIA and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like a certificate</font>

950
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,799
with this collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> two main names the</font>

951
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,270
server /<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respondent says okay you</font>

952
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,460
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that you own those</font>

953
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,250
domain names because that's what CH 2

954
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,440
and then acne provides it a few

955
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">different automated mechanisms by which</font>

956
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,690
the applicant for certificate can<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font>

957
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it owns a given domain name um you</font>

958
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:46,310
know it can set up an HTTP HTTP server

959
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,709
that responds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to certain structured</font>

960
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,310
query they conversion some dns records

961
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:54,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a TLS basse dance things like that</font>

962
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the applicant does</font>

963
00:51:54,830 --> 00:52:00,140
configure something under that domain

964
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,590
name the ca does a probe to see if if

965
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,480
that

966
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:05,630
if that thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been successfully set</font>

967
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,040
up and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so consider is that the</font>

968
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">applicant to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have proven he owns that</font>

969
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,540
domain and you know once this dance has

970
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">been completed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all of the names that</font>

971
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,430
are requested and<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

972
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,750
issue the certificate so nice thing

973
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:20,930
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting so that's kind of the basic</font>

974
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:24,260
flow requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> of certificate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove you</font>

975
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:26,930
on the names get the certificate that's

976
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,460
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entirety the protocol there's</font>

977
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,230
a revocation thingy so you can ask

978
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,170
cursor to no longer be valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font>

979
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">a different part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the life cycle nice</font>

980
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,970
thing about acne is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's extensible in a</font>

981
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,890
couple ways so it was built with an

982
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,959
extensible identifier space so you can

983
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,520
define acne for other types of

984
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifiers if you care about mac</font>

985
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,170
addresses or IP addresses or telephone

986
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,540
numbers we have the drafts right now for

987
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,820
telephone numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for stir and for IP</font>

988
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:56,330
addresses for something i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

989
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,520
they won't use it but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general you can</font>

990
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,740
define a new class of<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers for</font>

991
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">acne but then you also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to define</font>

992
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:06,350
some new ways to prove you own those

993
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:08,450
identifiers so the telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

994
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:10,130
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance defines a way you can</font>

995
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:14,689
prove you own a telephone number using

996
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:16,850
an sms-based interaction it's fun you

997
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">put this content in an SMS and you</font>

00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:23,750

999
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:25,910
phone number so yeah this has gotten

1000
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,770
obviously a fair bit of usage in the web

1001
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think what's encrypt is issued like 15</font>

1002
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:34,460
million certificates with it there now

1003
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:37,160
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 or 20 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so CA in the</font>

1004
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:41,050
world by usage they're the number one CA

1005
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,049
in the world by number of certificates

1006
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:46,880
hoping that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more ca's will use</font>

1007
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:50,180
this and it's getting using a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1008
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,500
different rewinding but even in the

1009
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,169
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Watson crept there's been</font>

1010
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,960
some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses for in serving</font>

1011
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Betty cases so in web cases even in a</font>

1012
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,050
web case has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of interesting</font>

1013
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,720
it's gotten into kind of embedded

1014
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:05,630
operational stuff a lot of that major

1015
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,069
growth those<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you know six and</font>

1016
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,170
seven-figure numbers have come from

1017
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,790
hosting providers that have integrated

1018
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,190
let's encrypt support into their hosting

1019
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,330
platforms so like dreamhost right now if

1020
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,250
you show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you spin up</font>

1021
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:18,440
host on green<font color="#E5E5E5"> hose literally you can</font>

1022
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,990
take one box and they'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS so</font>

1023
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,850
state using acne to talk to lots and

1024
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,549
Crips to get the certificates to do the

1025
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:28,220
HTTPS so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a few those</font>

1026
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:31,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">sightings of deployments in the web my</font>

1027
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:35,120
other favorite example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um free</font>

1028
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:36,560
the ISP in France has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using acne to</font>

1029
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,140
provision let's encrypt certificates

1030
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">there set-top boxes so supporting HTTPS</font>

1031
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface there it was slightly more</font>

1032
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:46,279
complicated setup where you know the

1033
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:48,230
set-top box talk to so central

1034
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,540
controller that owns the DNS zone from

1035
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:54,020
which the names are provisions for those

1036
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,400
devices but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's a</font>

1037
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">little proprietary internal dance</font>

1038
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,400
between the set-top box and central

1039
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,440
control and then the central controller

1040
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,690
does the a comedians with the CA and

1041
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,490
provides the cert backs the set-top box

1042
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,590
so there's some interesting embedded

1043
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,689
applications kind of starting to come up

1044
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:11,480
that are slightly broader than the web

1045
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:12,830
case but one it's a sort of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1046
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,750
throw that out because I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

1047
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,279
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know more in the operational</font>

1048
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,080
space and have some probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1049
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,000
use cases for the stuff beyond just the

1050
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:26,180
general web so that's the overview QA

1051
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,820
questions comments oh I ETS status wise

1052
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:33,859
we just finished<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group last call</font>

1053
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:35,840
and we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking on Thursday morning</font>

1054
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,810
or afternoon whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the acne meeting</font>

1055
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:41,540
is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the schedule about whether to hold</font>

1056
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,920
the draft to get some some more

1057
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,140
implementation of the current revision

1058
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,910
or I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send if the iesg but</font>

1059
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,000
anyway it's it's basically stable and

1060
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:52,839
done ietf last call coming soon so you

1061
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,590
know any last comments announces time

1062
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,590
any questions comments

1063
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,250
Jeff with Cisco um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a brain</font>

1064
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:06,869
storming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue I'm not gonna</font>

1065
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,720

1066
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:12,299
provided a good description of it just

1067
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,819
curious I mean because it's automated I

1068
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:16,220
love that part Security's always been

1069
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:20,430
hard work you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> automate it as awesome</font>

1070
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:22,259
what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it to help automate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tnx</font>

1071
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:27,240
of DNS SEC deployments or things like

1072
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:28,799
that or that's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> far fetched this DNS</font>

1073
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,899
SEC is still very limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> in deployment</font>

1074
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,750
around the world so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

1075
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,770
solving a slightly different problem

1076
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:39,000
right because you're imagining you

1077
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:41,430
securing kind of updates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zone</font>

1078
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,440
that within get security in a sec yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1079
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,520
think they're your kind of presuming

1080
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,410
that someone has a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticate</font>

1081
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're authorized to make those</font>

1082
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:51,569
changes here you're kind of starting in

1083
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,240
the acne case you're starting out from

1084
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:56,369
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero presumption you know some</font>

1085
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,129
client walks in off the street<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1086
00:56:56,369 --> 00:57:02,490
server has<font color="#E5E5E5"> no prior relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1087
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,770
and the prize the server has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify</font>

1088
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:07,770
any authorization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it grants to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1091
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:13,770
and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your imagination there might be</font>

1092
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:14,910
some other applications like that where

1093
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:19,559
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of build up</font>

1094

1110
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:12,150
security considerations addresses in

1111
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:14,549
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the vulnerabilities that</font>

1112
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,559
arise from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the verification channel so</font>

1113
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:17,970
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of have the abstract view of</font>

1114
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,099
this like there's kind of two channels

1115
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,379
by which the CA and the applicant

1116
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,339
communicate they communicate over<font color="#E5E5E5"> acne</font>

1117
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:28,829
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> https channel and then there's some</font>

1118
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:33,210
alternate some non<font color="#E5E5E5"> acme thing that the</font>

1119
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:37,520
ca does to verify that the applicant has

1120
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:40,319
the main aim and you know whether it's

1121
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,180
that kind of by assumption has no

1122
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,460
security to it that verification channel

1123
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,640
and so you're open to things along the

1124
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:50,730
path doing you're claiming that

1125
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:54,950
authorization so there's some tools in

1126
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:57,630
the that we describe the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1127
00:58:54,950 --> 00:59:00,899
making that job harder for the attacker

1128
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:02,700
there but um you know we recommend

1129
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,670
things like doing dns resolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1130
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple in multiple vantage points but</font>

1131
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:09,599
there's still that issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

1132
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:12,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's someone attacks you at the registry</font>

1133
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,839
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> registrar then yeah there's not</font>

1134
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:19,079
much you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

1135
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:20,790
empirically based so Warren<font color="#CCCCCC"> kamari but</font>

1136
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,490
most of these vulnerabilities already

1137
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:26,670
exists with you know normal cas not

1138
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:28,319
doing not using at me like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

1139
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:32,040
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones they could absolutely yeah</font>

1140
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:34,020
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in large part all that acne is</font>

1141
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:37,619
doing is automating existing practices

1142
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,730
of CAS it's a marginal incremental

1143
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,670
benefit because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1144
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,700
validation that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even empirical to</font>

1145
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,410
the degree acne

1146
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,419
like a lot of validation is done by

1147
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:49,868
sending email<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the registered</font>

1148
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:51,910
contacting who is rich you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1149
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:53,440
different set of vulnerabilities but you

1150
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:57,819
know there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a direct tie to</font>

1151
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:00,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology so yeah that several of</font>

1152
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:03,070
the mechanisms we've got an acne are

1153
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:07,500
kind of built out of things that are

1154
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:10,829
already in use in the pre acne<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki I</font>

1155
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:14,140
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> small degree of pride in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1156
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:17,349
some of the mechanisms that we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1157
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">ACME the analogous things and other</font>

1158
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:21,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">cieza de ployed have had some</font>

1159
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:24,160
vulnerabilities that we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch</font>

1160
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:26,650
in acne and we've gotten some analysis

1161
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,660
from from inria and karthik the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1162
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">do formal model in it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some</font>

1163
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,299
confidence this thing hold things

1164
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,210
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually provide</font>

1165
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,619
securities we think it does sort of

1166
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:38,440
another question along that lines you

1167
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:40,390
said there's like a profile for getting

1168
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,910
a certificate for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> address or an</font>

1169
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:47,020
address block but how do those folks

1170
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:51,910
empirically proof they have that draft

1171
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:54,400
is about 48 hours old it's a work in

1172
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:58,990
progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think basically what</font>

1173
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've proposed is well I think they've</font>

1174
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:03,129
proposed to reuse some of the HTTP and

1175
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,630
TLS options that they defined a new one

1176
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,369
I'm forgetting what that new one was but

1177
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:08,410
they snouted you could also reproduce

1178
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:11,170
that we do the HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> into law space</font>

1179
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:13,270
things here except you just connect to

1180
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:16,800
an IP address instead of connecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1181
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,800
domain name using those protocols

1182
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,060
there's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of security</font>

1183
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,618
considerations to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed for that</font>

1184
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,619
draft I'm like I said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new</font>

1185
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:34,370
dykes inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> this your usg I associate</font>

1186
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,500
with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> G want the other thing you could</font>

1187
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,549
you could envision you all right one

1188
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,410
other thing you can envision heroes

1189
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:41,690
things if you wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for like</font>

1190
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,609
provisioning you could define like an

1191
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:46,070
email identifier type and do some

1192
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,900
verification or perhaps some have some

1193
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">authority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they could prove the thought</font>

1194
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:54,500
they could grant authorization<font color="#E5E5E5"> use email</font>

1195
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:59,540
addresses again there's a few unexplored

1196
01:01:54,500 --> 01:02:02,870
use cases here we solve one big one it's

1197
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:06,410
all we've addressed one big one but

1198
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:11,259
there may be others anything else one

1199
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:14,779
quick question are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1200
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:19,940
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of firm as if you get chicken</font>

1201
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">roti to leave me personally so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocsp is</font>

1202
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,450
kind of external to this new acne um

1203
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:29,930
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the idea is that you know a</font>

1204
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:32,210
CA has to run multiple services in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

1205
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:34,419
to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of make the whole thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work in</font>

1206
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:37,010
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to doing issuance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and education</font>

1207
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:40,070
you know interactions with the applicant

1208
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:42,710
or owner<font color="#CCCCCC"> or certificate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's got to</font>

1209
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:48,380
have interactions like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CSP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issuing</font>

1210
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:50,180
crls with relying parties acne is kind

1211
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:52,460
of designed to dovetail well with those

1212
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:55,490
without replacing them so you know acne

1213
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:57,920
has a revocation end point where you can

1214
01:02:55,490 --> 01:03:00,080
wear an authorized for you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> request a</font>

1215
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,730
certificate be revoked<font color="#CCCCCC"> and provide a</font>

1216
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:05,509
revocation reason they can then go into

1217
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:08,390
the no CSP response it's also possible

1218
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">within acne and I think Wes encrypt has</font>

1219
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:15,740
support for this to request things like

1220
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:17,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> must say for extension so to put</font>

1221
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in the certificate that would</font>

1222
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:25,850
make revocation more efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in n</font>

1223
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:28,130
equations throw a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trick right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm around</font>

1224
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,620
