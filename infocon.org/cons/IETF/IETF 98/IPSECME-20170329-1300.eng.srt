1
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:17,280
for reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never understand and the</font>

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,280
reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it using Greek</font>

3
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:40,480
remembering my enemies r and s possible

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:44,250
litigation that it without making<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,250
relationship like joy

6

28
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,709
had with modified it since they<font color="#E5E5E5"> I posted</font>

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,620
his first time there's got to be a

30
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more discussed about the</font>

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,739
algorithm documents and there's going to

32
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,209
be perhaps the minimal ESP stuff in the

33
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,709
end depending if you have time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

34
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,140
should have because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have half an hour</font>

35
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:51,260
more time demurrer origionally supposed

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,700
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any comments or changes or</font>

37
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,109
something that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other items people</font>

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,988
want to put in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go</font>

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward so these the finished and almost</font>

40
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,870
ready drafts actually it's very hard to

41
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,839
see anything here yeah so we have

42
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,080
published<font color="#CCCCCC"> two RFC's in our you know</font>

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,870
charter list and we have to approve by

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,159
ist

45
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,920
no that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going monitor teen implement</font>

46
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,510
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> struts but there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,690
that man that's going to be later in

48
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,060
draft and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one crafty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

49
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,340
and cups that is now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ATF at last</font>

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,349
call and also and tell us atoms book

51
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,989
tells us move to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> for further away</font>

52
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,690
even 80 notice that he actually forgot

53
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:41,250
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in Alaska</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go to the next</font>

54
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,170
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I question to monitor</font>

55
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement algorithmic there is no issues</font>

56
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,708
in ganar door of the ER there was some

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,970
minor needs insecure and the IST was

58
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,109
actually reading relevant because they

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,129
notice that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an inconsistency</font>

60
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:58,140
there it says the<font color="#CCCCCC"> triple disease the</font>

61
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,950
text says<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should not and the table</font>

62
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">same a and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they may is actually</font>

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,170
the correct one this is it has been may

64
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,470
originally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the should not text was</font>

65
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,929
editor in the way back there in a text

66
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,519
and we test I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because you</font>

67
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,199
know we added get the same text today

68
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,918
you know other document at the same time

69
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,979
and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> suit not in in for ipsec the</font>

70
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,130
ESP because there is a problem with the

71
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">IV's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which I question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too it doesn't</font>

72
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,969
matter whenever condition that much data

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,889
editor the good bit short you know

74
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,550
blockcount actually matters so we

75
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,260
actually can keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a may here and</font>

76
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,270
that reasonably I think values<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is</font>

77
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,820
because it was the mandatory implement

78
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,320
before that so moving it from monitor to

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,900
implement too much they should notice

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,490
actually something that this bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,469
trouble there is no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

82
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:56,550
anything of them so if anybody has any

83
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:58,470
comments on this Marcus Marcus I'm I do

84
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,810
because I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> our very valuable</font>

85
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">lesson never give text slides to the</font>

86
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,440
chair because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he will modify it yes I</font>

87
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:15,630
have add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few more issues I dare on the</font>

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,360
next page oh this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the page 10 okay</font>

89
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,280
pause it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go to the next</font>

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,350
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these are new issues</font>

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,500
and I removed one of those your new

92
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,120
issues because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's nice</font>

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:34,060
and there was also text about saying

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">cha-cha 20 isn't ensued but it's not</font>

95
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,720
enough for should plus at that divorce

96
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,909
um no I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> said an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email about that</font>

97
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,680
but anyway so you have some

98
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,810
inconsistencies there that sucks i think

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,490
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them are international I</font>

100
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,810
think there are supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

101
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,980
we can actually talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those so</font>

102
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,990
first of all is this ecdsa it text says

103
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,419
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're expect to be downgraded but</font>

104
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,100
they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not suit my</font>

105
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,049
nose and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is</font>

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,970
correct but it's something that we say

107
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,710
yes we are going to be in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

108
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to be a grainy but you are not</font>

109
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,609
wrong creamy that yet because we don't

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,060
know what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be going happen</font>

111
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,370
with them and that's that's of course

112
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,680
one of the things we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss but but</font>

113
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,560
I so maybe if you all and maybe if you

114
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,389
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the introduction of the draft</font>

115
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we explain what should minus means</font>

116
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,040
it means that we think this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

117
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future yeah I know I know</font>

118
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:36,419
excellent candidate for shoot- your what

119
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:40,229
why do we expect um ecdsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become</font>

120
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:44,200
sound good I i think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

121
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think the current view is that there</font>

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,039
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no there's no hash negotiation there</font>

123
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,860
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing is that people are</font>

124
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,740
if everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes fine and we start</font>

125
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,169
using EDD<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI then we are going to be</font>

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,979
their abilities but if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to</font>

127
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecd EDD SI tell me I'm actually</font>

128
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,270
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> next if you don't move to do know</font>

129
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,130
the curve top photo 593 not EDD SI but

130
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,780
there you know safe curves then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

131
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">enemy this differ but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature</font>

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,390
it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> very speculative yeah that's</font>

133
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,820
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think every using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EDSA for</font>

134
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,460
certificates now<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all then don't see</font>

135
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,950
any statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any CS that they're</font>

136
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat this actually this is this</font>

137
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,680
is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy the other catching it on</font>

138
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,030
ecdsa yes sir yeah yeah so so so that's

139
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,430
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually think that they should</font>

140
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,229
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> still okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I we don't have a</font>

141
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,240
you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replacing</font>

142
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,109
it didn't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see what is going to</font>

143
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,220
be replaced but we can

144
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,010
and we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's people</font>

145
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,290
saying that these are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so good we</font>

146
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,969
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it move away from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

147
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,100
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they might be going</font>

148
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,070
down and I think that text is very vague

149
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,320
about this it's a say every might be

150
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying this going down in some ways or</font>

151
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,620
might not know you think might happen

152
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,599
the next signature algorithm that we

153
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use might be some people</font>

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">scranton then maybe it's only coming in</font>

155
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,590
20 years and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very speculative</font>

156
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:10,060
that that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this will be</font>

157
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:14,429
still okay okay right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine with</font>

158
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,300
either should we perhaps rather than I

159
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,680
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the text again the rather</font>

160
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,200
than saying just expected downgrade

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">should we mentioned specifically what we</font>

162
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,880
think is replacing like we mentioned if

163
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,360
EDD<font color="#CCCCCC"> sa is being used if the safe curves</font>

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,070
are being used that's likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> path is</font>

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,770
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the working class go yes</font>

166
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,840
if we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in a working group last</font>

167
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,760
call yes we would modify that but many

168
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,590
of you are pasta tell us what I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

169
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,620
have to approve it I don't want to do

170
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,170
any extra you know the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

171
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,070
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mandatory you know you're not</font>

172
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:50,020
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed they you know the Triple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> S</font>

173
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,300
is clearly inconsistent in the document

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,069
this is it it's us we are saying sued

175
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,439
and let me say that yes this might go

176
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,930
down it but it's not in a day and then

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,210
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next one the digital</font>

178
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,089
signatures it says expect to be

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,250
promoters promoted in the future from

180
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,020
suits to shoot plus or subtract that

181
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,070
reason why it's not suit plus now is

182
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,720
that we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

183
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,420
implementations to actually see if it's

184
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,490
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be gaining you know it</font>

185
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">updates it's the same thing with the</font>

186
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,650
shot chart 20 it's it should it's not

187
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">suit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plus even if you actually think</font>

188
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,770
that if everything goes fine and

189
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,810
everybody implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be</font>

190
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,760
next mandatory implement algorithmic but

191
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,739
you know before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see at least one</font>

192
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
implementation we we are not going to be

193
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,270
okay so to your comment before about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

194
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,070
know if safe curve that's mainly just

195
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,750
waiting for implementations yeah i think

196
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,700
tomorrow most of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are acts are you</font>

197
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,140
know seeing what happens with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,470
things so i actually don't want to put

199
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,300
in any you know go porns oh actually the

200
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,590
text for

201
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,359
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it is too new for shoot and so</font>

202
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,920
the new glasses so it's no do need to

203
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">shoot plus there's a plus in food and</font>

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,030
not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my note here but i will double</font>

205
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,030
check i think i was checking that

206
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,060
at this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> of writing there is not</font>

207
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,600
enough I cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> int'l implemented</font>

208
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">supporting charter 22 be able to</font>

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a suit blasts level that's why</font>

210
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,660
i remove it there because i think it's

211
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,370
it's clear why it's personal doctor

212
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,719
should pass here would you from<font color="#CCCCCC"> nokia so</font>

213
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,360
one color regarding the digital

214
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,180
signature regard the implications are

215
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,580
now so should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v13 i think they</font>

216
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">just clarify their text in the standard</font>

217
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,400
to use digital signature instead of

218
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,910
oldies EDSA education so it will push

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonders all this more advanced wonder</font>

220
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,060
that that's right that's why it should

221
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,959
show the meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s you should</font>

222
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,310
implement it and it most likely might be

223
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,810
it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the marsh mandatory</font>

224
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,000
implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument all then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we call the</font>

225
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,560
ad DSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually one</font>

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,730
of the things I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure cool this one</font>

227
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,430
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the next to mandatory</font>

228
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,120
implement our business EDD essay or you

229
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:22,349
know the digital signatures right in

230
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to that point internally yet we've</font>

231
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,570
implemented now<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdvsa and digital</font>

232
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,750
signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curves and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chacha poly</font>

233
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:36,120
so we will get sting things are coming

234
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:41,490
down by one yes good and and the last

235
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">one I terrorist is ecdsa which saw 256 I</font>

236
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,940
don't know why you work so saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

237
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,320
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be should plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

238
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:57,990
actually should be should still up you

239
00:11:46,320 --> 00:12:01,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so my guess is that I think</font>

240
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only change my take is that the only</font>

241
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,940
change we actually do is the triple-s

242
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,560
and a polio are you agreeing on that

243
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay if people agree on that and that</font>

244
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">denied exactly just these are just</font>

245
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,530
something text at web and if it would be

246
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,760
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call yes we could actually text and</font>

247
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,430
think about this but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are this</font>

248
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,230
far far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we hopefully are going</font>

249
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,849
to be issuing this you know as a new

250
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:30,090
proposed algorithms or monitoring rambro

251
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,740
algorithms faster than you know what

252
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,660
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they take it for the</font>

253
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,990
last time so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know in</font>

254
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,939
five

255
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,180
years or three years we actually but we

256
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,830
come back to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh so should I push</font>

257
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,649
this change out that which is that about

258
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,700
yes triple-s I'll and a digital had some

259
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:49,770
neat yeah no no the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASD is already it's</font>

260
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,930
already past is<font color="#E5E5E5"> T so I think you're</font>

261
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:55,439
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a diversion of the raft and</font>

262
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask if it's ice from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ice tea if it's</font>

263
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if the macys you did are solving</font>

264
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:05,640
their issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay yeah and there's</font>

265
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,320
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nits from from from benoit</font>

266
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,939
from the gen art review and prevent

267
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,330
Campbell's comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that also</font>

268
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be addressed those are already</font>

269
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,350
done in a draft like I have a trap for

270
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,779
me ok so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are old address when do</font>

271
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,060
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan to post it after the meeting</font>

272
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:25,050
awesome or if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really boring during</font>

273
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:30,149
the meeting wait let's go the next issue

274
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:32,219
is said ESP algorithm so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

275
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:35,250
same things you know we have some

276
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,529
reviews nothing stuff some minor needs

277
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,040
and so on but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the issues in from</font>

278
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:44,070
the is T so diversity is that is

279
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">obsoletes the cemetery to one in</font>

280
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">cryptographic communists only and I</font>

281
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,050
think agree that the cryptographic is

282
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,880
completely obsolete where there are a

283
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,819
mix of trucks remove it appear so they

284
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,020
are happy then the Manoir Keating is

285
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,880
something that actually needs to be

286
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,920
having some<font color="#E5E5E5"> texted that actually is the</font>

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">current text is they're saying that okay</font>

288
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,829
if you use bonded manual keys you must

289
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,089
use a yes CBC mode and I think that

290
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:08,609
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is just</font>

its monetary use so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

296
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,209
something that we need to fix and it

297
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,390
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text saying that</font>

298
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:26,729
you must not use a SD GM and any of

299
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,060
these size ciphers that are not safe

300
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:33,180
without the reef the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonzero keys are</font>

301
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,579
saying yeah oh I'm not sure if this

302
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,079
works I don't hear it hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

305
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,990
so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effect on and</font>

306
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,209
you're right<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we just concluded</font>

307
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,709
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBC was the only one you could use so</font>

308
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,939
we set must but we should really say

309
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,738
these these alligator

310
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:52,169
cannot use because of manual keating and

311
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:54,089
guaranteed counters and ID's you cannot

312
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,978
use these algorithms so if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

313
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,720
texted to flip it<font color="#E5E5E5"> around yeah but</font>

314
00:14:55,979 --> 00:15:00,209
actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what would be the</font>

315
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,679
difference between the Blowfish ESP or

316
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:10,018
you know ASC pcs prophecy ABC or ASC

317
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:12,179
busy yeah but anyway anyway meet me yeah

318
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,529
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway so i would i would</font>

319
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,919
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the monetary</font>

320
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,720
monarchies visit uni and we should

321
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,909
actually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> say any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> squeezed oj</font>

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,439
implementations that's what other thing

323
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:24,509
micah richards and so what I heard you

324
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,939
say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this document will be</font>

325
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:29,220
updated such that it will say the

326
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:31,589
following algorithms can or should be

327
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">used the following algorithms should not</font>

328
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:38,549
be used and anything not in this list as

329
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:40,199
a may is that what I heard you say not

330
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:42,869
actually we are currently saying that

331
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,829
maniwaki should not say I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:45,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually something you actually</font>

333
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,449
going to another category that you might

334
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:52,949
say for manual<font color="#CCCCCC"> King in managing in</font>

335
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">general and should not be used ever and</font>

336
00:15:52,949 --> 00:16:00,299
if you are actually I think it actually

337
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:02,879
is must not be say you know if you're

338
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,489
stupid enough to use manual keying um

339
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,429
then the following things are really bad

340
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:10,619
ideas so don't use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that list</font>

341
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:12,149
if you the end of the list of safe

342
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:17,399
algorithms is empty at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of that</font>

343
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:19,319
effort that's okay so currently it says

344
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,439
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the monarchy is is not to be used</font>

345
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:25,079
as is inherited dangerous and I think

346
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:27,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the axe actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say let's talk about</font>

347
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,449
you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that actually is good</font>

348
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,470
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> single use because actually there is</font>

349
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:33,598
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be implementing man</font>

350
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,689
work is anyway because it's some cases

351
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:39,419
useful for debugging and so on and you

352
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,889
know testing type of thing so I don't

353
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,749
know two people to say that ok you are

354
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:44,189
you are not confirmed confirming too you

355
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:46,199
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this RFC if you happened to</font>

356
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:48,029
implement man working and it's actually

357
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,858
sometimes people actually use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plug</font>

358
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:53,039
into different key<font color="#E5E5E5"> marysville protocols</font>

359
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:54,629
but anyway so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very such</font>

360
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,309
a that it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should not be</font>

361
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:00,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to it's correct there but then it</font>

362
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:01,500
we know which algorithm is actually very

363
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,670
difficult

364
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,990
I think we actually this is something

365
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,579
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve here I think we</font>

366
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,470
actually should come to back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list</font>

367
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,770
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having textin in front of</font>

368
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:14,550
it right I just recalled one question

369
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:17,609
and going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask the</font>

370
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,240
working group to see if it would be a

371
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:25,079
good choice um we've been thinking about

372
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,150
duplicating chippa desk and we know that

373
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:31,310
there are some places is still being

374
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:35,000
used and we wonder if if we do gasps

375
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:38,760
would anybody having a hot burn for that

376
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,070
policy option now we already say for ESP

377
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,590
it should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for I question two is</font>

378
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,419
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> May so we don't care if you</font>

379
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,610
deprecated it at me people can actually

380
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,700
remove it if they duplicate means like

381
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,990
no use that's that's fine for us that

382
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,610
have you already say it's made major

383
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,530
implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iike first one and it</font>

384
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:59,669
should not be used in should not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

385
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I in ESP so okay okay and if you have</font>

386
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,500
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we recorded a must not</font>

387
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:14,280
okay okay sounds good huh all right

388
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:16,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you so Danielle I think the reason</font>

389
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,440
we said must not for the manual king is

390
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">not only it's a bad idea but only one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,180
the streets in is mentioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet you</font>

392
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,100
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> not but the other the other two</font>

393
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,290
suites are not so clear about the most

394
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,480
nuts sir so I think in DCM I think

395
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same but I'm saying GG m8 and</font>

396
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,570
for Paula tata tata 20 are or actually

397
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,610
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the counter mode ciphers are</font>

398
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,649
inherently dangerous with you know man

399
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,030
work is because in man work is actually

400
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,470
means that you type in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

401
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,300
interconnect file and when you reboot

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> started sequence number from you</font>

403

know from the strats and you actually

404
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:58,590
have you know but a strictly everyone

405
00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:00,990
see must not the exit is so if there're

406
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,590
several make our creams that can be used

407

408
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:09,300
somewhat safe with manual keys but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know i think the current director was</font>

that in two or three years there will

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face that change</font>

we are already you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some of these</font>

458
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,830
came back from ISD refute is that they

459
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,390
wanted some more explicit entry that

460
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">said that anything not listed may be</font>

461
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,980
used and I think we we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of argue</font>

462
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,240
that we've already explained this in the

463
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,700
introduction or the abstract and we

464
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,530
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it again</font>

465
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,180
Jackson I don't know how to resolve that

466
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,280
issue you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say that they point</font>

467
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,800
them to put those two out<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so I</font>

468
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,000
think that should be no you have a soda

469
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,620
no I will not make any changes yeah yeah

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:53,270
yeah I see all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are actually</font>

471
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:56,270
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right next one in EDSA so</font>

472
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,129
actually now so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the we have a</font>

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">big group last call done and there was</font>

474
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,910
this question about to be used 0 or

475
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,540
should we use something else for

476
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,580
identity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most people in</font>

the listing to be favoring of using new

479
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:18,020
there's anybody here actually want to

480
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:22,340
stop using<font color="#CCCCCC"> JIRA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of don't see</font>

481
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:26,720
anybody or you have a comment comment

482
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:30,800
about the EDSA I lack if you curve in

483
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,690
casa but are too<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it EDSA</font>

conveyor hunter quality at switch real

495
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:31,460
shame because it's a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you have</font>

496
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,340
no well we have to have standard both

497
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,160
here and in TLS that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are specifying the</font>

498
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,320
use of EDSA before it's worth opens it

499
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,410
sells well to actually implement it and

500
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have heard from riches nothing</font>

501

but that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it they</font>

502
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan for some next release that's coming</font>

503
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:57,470
out next year I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think so it will be a</font>

504
00:23:52,010 --> 00:24:01,280
thing thing is the algorithm that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

505
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,560
using in Ike is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generally decided by</font>

506
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,160
the certificate that we're using and as

507
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:10,550
long as the major ca's are issuing only

508
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,830
our essay or ecdsa that's what we're

509
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,570
going to use but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making these</font>

510
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,879
documents in expectation that at some

511
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,490
point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use EDD essay</font>

512
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,470
and open the cell code is coming there's

513
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,200
many other libraries that already have

514
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,280
such code so i don't see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

515
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,640
problem as for the identifier for the

516
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:36,860
hash well<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is already called none</font>

517
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,440
it's no hash is sort of sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font>

518
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,110
but I'll because some people might use

519
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero for special value than it's fine to</font>

520
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,330
use a the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> available number and if I</font>

521
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,540
understand correctly the 01 version

522
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:53,149
actually already removed the text about

523
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,180
the cheer oh yeah so we actually cook

524
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,900
we're ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward out Tommy</font>

525
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,740
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple so just I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to the</font>

526
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,020
point of is it ready should we do it

527
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,990
sadly our implementation isn't open but

528
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,300
we have implemented EDSA and Ike it's

529
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">working it's good we definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

530
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,190
move ahead with it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

531
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">hold it up for any reason internally</font>

532
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,880
right now we're using five because

533
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,900
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next number we haven't</font>

534
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,870
deployed that yet but it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great to</font>

535
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:27,110
get number five out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so we don't do</font>

536
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,610
bad things to get number five out the

537
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:34,040
outers need to make and you know request

538
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">from iono it's expert review as the</font>

539
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,389
document register which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

540
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,370
you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the read number for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requester</font>

541
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,320
iono<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never said it to me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

542
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,479
lucky the number we could talk to do you

543
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,179
explain no no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

544
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,080
iono expert can't give the numbers

545
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:53,630
directly so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess do we want we</font>

546
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,830
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hum on the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just I got</font>

547
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">six because nobody said anything about</font>

548
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,899
the chi-rho expert

549
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,980
and he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say yes okay so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

550
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,689
actually we are going to be with the

551
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,460
five and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the current text in the</font>

552
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,259
document is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i think activation</font>

553
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,330
after this document we should start

554
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,639
actually we have done the last call but

555
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,769
so we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make you know</font>

556
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:19,500
start the publication requested for this

557
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">so one more thing curly said that they</font>

558
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,950
might replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oid and then we would</font>

559
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,889
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue a new draft with the new</font>

560
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,919
ID but they're finally they decided to

561
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:35,158
stay with the old oid so Texas fine as

562
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,460
it is yeah they've they've rolled back

563
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,840
so it's it because they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

564
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,120
for New York is we actually going to be

565
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,459

571
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:15,269
next slide I didn't remove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

572
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,309
so now energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who wants to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

573
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hola muchacha who's going to talk</font>

574
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ball won't have this text the</font>

575
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:32,429
for the slides you have never seen

576
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:35,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">before uh artists microphones much</font>

577
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,080
better ok so we've removed the request

578
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,639
limited domain so the client could send

579
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,899
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of domains it only was</font>

580
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:43,229
interested in and we talked about this

581
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:45,090
and we've removed that feature the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sidh</font>

582
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,970
every internal dns domain option for the

583
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,340
sender is Sarah sighs we added some

584
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,230
local policy clarifications and we've

585
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,689
removed the requirement for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the childís</font>

586
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,879
rate to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for any dns IP addresses</font>

587
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,340
that percent so previously we said if

588
00:27:56,879 --> 00:28:02,908
you send an IP address than one two

589
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,110
three as a dns name<font color="#CCCCCC"> server for one of</font>

590
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,850
the domains then you must make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

591
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a child i say up for that appear</font>

592
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,830
dress and after talking previously in a

593
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,959
working group

594
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,639
was decided to remove that so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

595
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,440
the issues we changed the last version

596
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,640
that was like the 00 document after

597
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,710
adoption so the open issues are there's

598
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,380
two items aware we had consensus about

599
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,190
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is CFG request see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if she reply</font>

600
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,510
in the attribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we decided that</font>

601
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,100
you could only reply to them when you

602
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,649
saw them and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of based more</font>

603
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,480
on the IP one model and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iclear took</font>

604
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">or RC actually says that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can send</font>

605
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things optionally and you should</font>

606
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,850
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to ignore them so we still need</font>

607
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make those changes with those changes</font>

608
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,949
will be made and then the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> real open</font>

609
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,639
issue is the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the dns and what</font>

610
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,139
to do on the VPN disconnect or reconnect

611
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:51,699
whereas specifically terror me have

612
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:54,120
quite different opinions on what to do

613
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,010
with the cache entries so my opinion is

614
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,408
the case where if i connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read calm</font>

615
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,899
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bugzilla overcame</font>

616
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:04,000
i'm getting the internal IP address and

617
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:06,399
if I cash that and if then disconnect my

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,230
VPN then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go back to the public</font>

619
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,860
IP address of the server so i need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

620
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,299
flush my cash and so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's</font>

621
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,678
important that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the</font>

622
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,029
protocol it says you know flush the

623
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,700
cache<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these entries if you</font>

624
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">reconnected or disconnect your domain</font>

625
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,210
anantara has a different opinion on that

626
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:27,580
document inside secure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

627
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

628
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">be late there you know cash interest</font>

629
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,590
immediately when you have you know a

630
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:34,809
child<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI going down or like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

631
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,330
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down but I mean that would</font>

632
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:38,799
actually you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> course troubles if you</font>

633
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,870
have it because what you usually do you

634
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,250
just recreate it immediately but if you

635
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,689
tear down and then you have you know

636
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,760
love your connection sir you know

637
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,200
failing because the dns name isn't funny

638
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,658
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very funny when you</font>

639
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,970
have you know 10,000 you know-- tabs

640
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,559
open so choppy their own names that then

641
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,600
you suddenly have them you know I agree

642
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">but in in my view you just have not</font>

643
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,870
turned on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection yet so you're</font>

644
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,490
welcome to use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> old cash yeah but</font>

645
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,350
your text say<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down we'll</font>

646
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:08,500
remove the cash enters immediately you

647
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,178
must remove them yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

648
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,679
question well actually likely to it's

649
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,899
the same right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you if you</font>

650
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,000
killed I to need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> child</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also tied is</font>

651
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:21,770
not the issue Chinese my face it's like

652
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:27,890
I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm down Mike</font>

653
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:30,060
all right Mike Mike you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have Mike Klis</font>

654
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,180
sorry if you don't flush the cache that

655
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,370
mean it's not home if you don't flush

656
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:39,480
the cache then you end up with entries

657
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:43,620
for non routable IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

658
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,060
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work anywhere no that's</font>

659
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,469
what that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea when you have a</font>

660
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,240
non-routable address you see what

661
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,130
happens there then when you send the

662
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,740
traffic it will drinker type a sec to

663
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,830
create it again and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it</font>

664
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,820
back that's that's the basic idea

665
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,449
because I mean you have that you have

666
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">the treatment rules that are still so</font>

667
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,100
Michael Richardson so so I think that

668
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,590
that the Paul's use case where you have

669
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,929
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different I a record or quite a record</font>

670
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,600
for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal versus external I think</font>

671
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:15,690
that's maybe fundamentally broken arm so

672
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,530
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I realize it's done all</font>

673
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I think it's fundamentally</font>

674
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,800
broken I think that you should have

675
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,500
either two different names or something

676
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:27,030
that that that because if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font>

677
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,910
risk of disclosing traffic and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

678
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,950
go publicly if the link was down then

679
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,350
obviously there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no risk of disclosing</font>

680
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,940
traffic right because you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be happy</font>

681
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it in the clear then you should</font>

682
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,240
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what who cares do it in the</font>

683
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,430
clear or whenever it changes doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

684
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,470
here clear or whatever but Tarot's use

685
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,210
case i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you have a</font>

686
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,760
bunch of these internal things that you

687
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,160
want to you want to reach again um so

688
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,980
you know close your laptop you move

689
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,690
addresses your IQ sex<font color="#CCCCCC"> die you bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

690
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,030
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hit reload you expect it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

691
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,590
and to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so he's inviting</font>

692
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,990
users to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> confused so that would be</font>

693
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,699
based on the TTL of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those dns records in</font>

694
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,380
your cash that is really sketchy so

695
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,240
you'll end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> like with half the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

696
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,600
not working anyway because did dns

697
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,400
record happen to expire and you're just

698
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,169
typing in names that aren't part of the

699
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,240
public's actually you don't know if

700
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,070
you'll get the internal dress or an RN

701
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,600
annex domain one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why i</font>

702
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,540
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the split dns is fundamentally</font>

703
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,330
broken actually but but assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

704
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:28,500
that you've pinned some things to have

705
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:32,159
some domains be internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font>

706
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not expire even if the TTL of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

707
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,490
rest so you've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I've got some</font>

708
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,080
configuration that means

709
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,720
domains i look up internally through

710
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,590
this these other places that stuff

711
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,610
should probably have its own TTL does it

712
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know I haven't read the</font>

713
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:50,340
documents detail to know that and that

714
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,220
should persist persist for a period of

715
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,928
time and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that period of time is</font>

716
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,370
potentially very long but but then

717
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,170
you've got this really inconsistent

718
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,059
results as if you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

719
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,770
zero cash and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach</font>

720
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:04,559
this internal resource it's not going to

721
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,940
trigger any VPN because I know and so so

722
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,410
that's that's part of the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

723
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have and I think that's fundamentally</font>

724
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,000
broken and I think that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

725
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:14,690
solutions in DNS that most people and

726
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,640
live in a v4 only world don't understand

727
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,030
that that would permit this to work very

728
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,260
well that's right so so I realize you

729
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,490
guys live in this real world of

730
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,230
administrators that think they own ten

731
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,480
net and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one ten net and</font>

732
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,100
they only have one VPN up right so I

733
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,690
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know that those those people</font>

734
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,760
I mean I think they're idiots but and

735
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,960
we're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help them out right so</font>

736
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,570
I'm saying if we're going to help them

737
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,880
out then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to we need to have that</font>

738
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,990
some kind of pinning so so that those

739
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,870
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have a time to live and</font>

740
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:47,760
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring up your VPN then I</font>

741
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,500
think you get essentially new records

742
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,600
and new<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls and everything's good right</font>

743
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that work but I</font>

744
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,080
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you want to flush the cache</font>

745
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,179
when that when connections go down

746
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,610
that's what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say right or</font>

747
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,170
if you do maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Paul's right maybe</font>

748
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,939
you want to flush at every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

749
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,590
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it make a</font>

750
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,750
consistent experience which is that the

751
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,629
user learns the names will never work

752
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,489
unless he clicks on his VPN button even

753
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:13,139
if he just moved from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room to the</font>

754
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,388
next room and closes lid temporary

755
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,310
temporarily he knows he has to hit the

756
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,470
VPN button and get out his card<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in</font>

757
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,909
whatever right why does your VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font>

758
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:25,290
when you suspend your laptop but that's

759
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,060
like 80 times more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been my</font>

760
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,830
laptop because I wind up on weird

761
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:35,969
networks of hotel or something I don't

762
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:37,770
know Tommy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polly Apple um so I mean I</font>

763
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:39,388
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> dude the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the real world</font>

764
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,230
perspective that's driving this I I

765
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:45,149
think we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave in something</font>

766
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,609
about flushing the cash I'm fine

767
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,759
softening it and saying like depending

768
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">on what your</font>

769
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,100
implementation does you may flush the

770
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:56,560
cache or if you expect these DNS names

771
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,560
to be truly global and managed correctly

772
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a broken split</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

773
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,150
configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> or your enterprise then</font>

774
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,410
you cannot flush it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

775
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,330
iterate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it needs to</font>

776
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,649
be solved in this document this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

777
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:13,990
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the world's problems on</font>

778
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:15,670
split dns to the point of triggering<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

779
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may at least on our end we're not</font>

780
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,520
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trigger based on the address</font>

781
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,529
once the VPN has gone down oftentimes oh

782
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,930
I mean what solutions to do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

783
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,900
they trigger based on the fact that the

784
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,730
host name cannot be resolved anymore and

785
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,460
so rather than treating us an address

786
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,470
you trigger based on something about the

787
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:40,960
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the DNS failing and you realize</font>

788
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that oh dang it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got screwed up yes yes</font>

789
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,620
it's a known p name so there are other

790
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,360
ways to solve this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think we</font>

791
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,859
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to iterate them all here we can</font>

792
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,740
soften language and just kind of move on

793
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,560
but but will the softening of the

794
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,020
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost center probability or</font>

795
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,610
expectation problems later on because we

796
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,800
already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> four different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations</font>

797
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:03,160
in this room so does the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

798
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,750
the expectations really matter all that

799
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,480
much because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just a local</font>

800
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,040
client policy about what it does so I me

801
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,160
to the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we've gone in the</font>

802
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,020
draft of saying that you know the client

803
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,879
is no longer specifying to the server

804
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,970
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that I'm willing to</font>

805
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,680
accept essentially the clients already

806
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,240
potentially trimming down the list of

807
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,609
domains that's going to be doing split

808
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS for it's making its own local policy</font>

809
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,690
decisions it can also make its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

810
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,210
policy decision about how it treats the

811
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:36,310
cash yeah that is consistent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

812
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree yeah Kyle Bekker its Facebook um I</font>

813
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,830
have seen some issues where people want

814
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to basically when you're on VPN redirect</font>

815
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,120
people on that VPN to say some like

816
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,840
release candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

817
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,520
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and then if you're on not</font>

818
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,250
against public internet go to a

819
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,050
different site and then the release

820
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,920
candidate for sending for whatever it's

821
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,829
only available on to VPN and that does

822
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,229
end up in

823
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">shoo when you disconnect from VPN but</font>

824
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:07,968
still at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast entry for some IPS</font>

825
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,789
only internally route of all so I do

826
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:22,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is an issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for smoking is</font>

827
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:24,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">released their community I think I think</font>

828
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,910
it's actually you know as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

829
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:28,099
thirsty I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

830
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">interpreting seal because its eternal of</font>

831
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:32,660
the machine anyway so your expectations

832
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:34,578
is going to be same when it's your

833
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,078
machine and my expectation going to be

834
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,729
the same for my machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's going</font>

835
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be same for my machine all the time</font>

836
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:40,069
because I'm losing the one

837
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:42,019
implementation I'm not going to be

838
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:44,089
switching from desert a doctor but I

839
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:46,069
very private suites I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope for</font>

840
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:49,339
that they potentially go either to the

841
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:52,160
same or better and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I actually</font>

842
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:55,219
get CS it but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current takes to say</font>

843
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,288
that you have you must you know first

844
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:59,509
plastic ashes and that's the most is

845
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:01,549
what I've actually you know say you

846
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:03,140
could say that yes you you should be you

847
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:05,029
know you should remove the cash she

848
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,410
immediately many you know fear that you

849
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:08,209
are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get be in the VPN</font>

850
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,529
anymore that would be actually much

851
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:10,759
better decks or stuff like that but I

852
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:13,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we got it from back to the least</font>

853
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:16,910
and you know it discussion there and go

854
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:19,400
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesus yes on an inside I think people</font>

855
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,410
agree that it that we can relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

856
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,089
master so the question just becomes are

857
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,348
we just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> relax the must and</font>

858
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:25,910
leave the data are we going to actually

859
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:30,199
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of this discussion into the</font>

860
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:33,199
document I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember from the</font>

861
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:34,940
document do you also flush the car the

862
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:41,359
cash when you're connecting or only

863
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct well so actually took affair my</font>

864
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,098
implementation does that what at the

865
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:48,559
draft says it I don't know all right

866
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:50,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so they come back to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list of</font>

867
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">this issue and I think actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

868
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:54,140
most of it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers to actually</font>

869
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:56,089
decide what taxable to put their oddity

870
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,249
you know you can propose some text<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

871
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:02,119
the working group will disagree with you

872
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:04,788
or or agree with you ok the next

878
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:27,760
visible from the air I should hopefully

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:31,240
go ok this is both con crypto I i I'd be

too next slide this is a next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do about it that the obvious</font>

890
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,280
solution would be to come with a post

891
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:08,410
quantum key<font color="#CCCCCC"> i key exchange a good idea</font>

892
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,680
but there's nothing that we really like

893
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:14,109
right now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to have a comp</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">seven five or seven years come up with</font>

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,240
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know we want to wait</font>

897
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,210
that long so let's come up with

898
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,788
temporary solution but what I'd idea

899
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">with our strategy here is actually have</font>

900
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,049
both sites have a shared secret and

901
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,270
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they stir in the shared secret</font>

902
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:33,460
in when they derive the keys and so if

903
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,259
someone someone breaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difficult as</font>

904
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,480
long as they can't break that they

905
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,390
shared the secret they still can't be

906
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,430
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> redrive the keys and therefore</font>

907
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,109
we're safe and the keys need something

908
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:53,160
ridiculous valve entropy but exactly

909
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:57,308
achievable next slide or sorry is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

910
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um what we talked with weed mostly</font>

911
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:03,670
agree about the acquirement such

912
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,680
algorithm guild is important I think I

913
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,299
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs be protected I traffic is</font>

914
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,538
less important but it's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to</font>

915
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:12,940
be a bit debated available I have we

916
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:15,160
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current draft right here and</font>

917
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,569
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of points to that were</font>

918
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,828
brought up on the mailing list and

919
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:22,420
that's go through them next slide first

920
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:24,579
set open issue was how we stirred the

921
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,990
property that the shared secret or what

922
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:29,720
we call PPK

923
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:33,850
the drafters it in to every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single child</font>

I this loft<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hopefully not</font>

927
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:50,680
butchering that that that too badly

then uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> there after the death yours</font>

931
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:04,730
everything is derived from this skd

932
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're all safe one nice thing about that</font>

933
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:10,369
is you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to remember which</font>

934
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,619
which preacher key you actually used the

935
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:15,230
Dan Harkins also put the made a separate

936

proposal about<font color="#E5E5E5"> only changing the ipsec</font>

938
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,820
expansion uh what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

939
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,320
somehow come up with a consensus about

940
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,780
which of these three approaches or

941
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:40,480
possibly a fourth approach is what we

942
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:45,290
really want to do comments questions is

943
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,060
everyone anyone awake<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm buddy</font>

944
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,730
else can talk I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Darryl Piper I helped</font>

945
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,960
design this message and Arkin's I mean

946
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:56,200
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

947
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,200
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> nest but that's my comp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

948
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:04,130
given him I think actually that I have

949
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,109
proposed a one-way also earlier very

950
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,630
early<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I think I think the key</font>

951
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matt only is has the problem that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

952
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,670
it has the properties if there's

953
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,259
something wrong if the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt if it's</font>

954
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,240
wrong we don't know this if it does

955
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,850
notice it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the ESP traffic is you</font>

956
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,470
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much this way I actually want</font>

957
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,540
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ike that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

958
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,009
actually notice in the ike that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok there</font>

959
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,460
you know for example the authentication

960
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:30,560
fails because they you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sergey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PPP k</font>

961
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,880
is wrong and that's why that's why I

962
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,450
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the correct solution</font>

963
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,210
is to know somewhere in the volta a ski

964
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,589
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> T which actually desk ed has a good</font>

965
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,670
property at that they if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you because</font>

966
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,339
that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

967
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,770
when you are doing Ricky of the ik say

968
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:47,930
it's used to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next keys for</font>

969
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,690
their weakest Ricky so that will offer

970
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:53,290
you after the Ricky you also the ike

971
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:56,599
traffic are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> PPK protected uh</font>

972
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,940
here's a suggestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm we make it</font>

973
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:05,690
really explicit uh basically we<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange</font>

974
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:08,299
uh notifies after we just create the IKS

975
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,089
Isis to negotiate that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

976
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:14,480
want to do this ah would if<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font>

977
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:16,849
notifies included say a hash of the tpk

978
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,010
yes I would see if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong hash</font>

979
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">its notice to notify that immediately</font>

980
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,910
and therefore they<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't know that</font>

981
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">gee that is what specifically is wrong</font>

982
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,808
that that's one of the problem there is

983
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,180
that these actually knows which part of

984
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:31,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication went from good then</font>

985
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,980
we'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know attack</font>

986
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,180
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ppk separately</font>

987
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,910
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the different error</font>

988
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,259
message if one is wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other is and</font>

989
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,808
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be better</font>

990
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,059
to have you know just normal equation to

991
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:47,210
authentication failure coming out even

992
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,829
if you have a PPK failure wrong or if

993
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,450
you have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> other type of</font>

994
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:52,970
authentication fair because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still out</font>

995
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:54,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like because I</font>

996
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,058
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I think it actually</font>

997
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,859
it's better to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that way it's</font>

998
00:44:56,059 --> 00:45:00,170
actually gives you know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

999
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:02,119
send any extra bits in the you know wire

1000
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,770
because we have already you know we

1001
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,290
calculate the hash to do thousand

1002
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:08,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">occasion hash and so if it just put the</font>

1003
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:11,808
ppk somewhere in there we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1004
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,190
them you know arrow there our mom just

1005
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:18,109
thinking cry do we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font>

1006
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:19,970
enough what do you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

1007
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:22,549
really know the ppk until you've change

1008
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,140
identities the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP case the out of the</font>

1009
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:26,690
case in hash is calculated in love yes

1010
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,848
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so yeah that sounds like a</font>

1011
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">resort proto and I'd actually is one of</font>

1012
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:32,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

1013
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,058
negation hash is calculated using one of

1014
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,970
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> s key actually it's be a and B</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1015
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:41,150
so they actually feed us to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ppk in</font>

1016
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:45,618
SKT and escape ER and pei then they

1017
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:50,119
actually get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem Michael</font>

1018
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Richardson so um and I agree very strong</font>

1019
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,800
with taro and I and I agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1020
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,860
my lean pork

1021
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,190
whatever we do it's locally<font color="#CCCCCC"> la ghable as</font>

1022
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,170
to which was actually failed so that

1023
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,930
local administrator can actually see

1024
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,150
what did I screw up uh but that's

1025
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,310
exactly what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> taro was suggesting and</font>

1026
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,170
that not happened yes no no no no he's

1027
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,210
saying the opposite the remote guy

1028
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,280
doesn't know which one I was wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1029
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,370
local guy knows what's wrong so can't

1030
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,740
just be opaque oops you know stuff went

1031
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:22,569
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what happened</font>

1032
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,580
in Mike will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one with various things</font>

1033
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,500
originally with with pre shared secret

1034
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,790
keys if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got the wrong you just just</font>

1035
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,170
couldn't decrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and didn't really</font>

1036
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,180
know what's going on the right we're a

1037
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:34,060
lot better situation with ip24 a lot of

1038
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,339
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some people in the</font>

1039
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,779
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the room if they think this</font>

1040
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,460
through may ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question well if I</font>

1041
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,270
have gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the effort of distributing</font>

1042
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,800
/ Pierre keys PK's why am i bothering

1043
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,180
with any other kind of authentication

1044
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,500
because that would you know seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1045
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">stronger and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think one of the answers</font>

1046
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,550
is because you know you have other other

1047
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,440
issues of scaling and other things like

1048
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">this that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but i think</font>

1049
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authors in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group</font>

1050
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,580
needs to ask the question how to what

1051
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,320
extent do we think that that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1052
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,799
encourage and make it easy for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1053
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,530
deploy this kind of thing in advance of

1054
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,360
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's some serious</font>

1055
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">chicken and egg problems in this process</font>

1056
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,380
if we don't think anybody except the

1057
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,540
super secure people are going to bother

1058
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,450
to comply it then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1059
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,490
on customers checkbox lists the vendors

1060
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,750
aren't going to produce it and the end

1061
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,209
result is that no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> will use it</font>

1062
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,650
including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know would</font>

1063
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,050
like to have more than one supplier for

1064
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,150
their super secure stuff so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1065
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,350
issue right so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1066
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,370
it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1067
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,799
little bit issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1068
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,150
surprised several people<font color="#CCCCCC"> said oh my</font>

1069
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,640
goodness we don't have to even bother

1070
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,530
deciding what the format of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ppk is</font>

1071
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,690
printed and I'm like oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> goodness</font>

1072
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,670
that's like the most basic system in

1073
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,020
thing the guy can't type in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ppk cuz</font>

1074
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,370
his formats different the other one and

1075
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:52,290
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't know how to use perl unpack</font>

1076
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:54,279
on it right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> just honestly that's</font>

1077
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:56,020
Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> k labs told me you know that</font>

1078
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,670
that's the level of administrator we're

1079
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,980
dealing with so if we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1080
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,140
make it easy for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1081
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:05,230
actually my question is why bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1082
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:08,100
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to be used by the NSA to</font>

1083
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:12,220
secure you know US government's

1084
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,569
you know what they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go to their</font>

1085
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,490
two preferred vendors tell them to

1086
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,960
implement your protocol maybe you're one

1087
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,089
of those preferred vendors already and

1088
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,580
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right we hardly even need a</font>

1089
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:23,470
standards action right Scott you decide

1090
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,900
what to do you're done let us know

1091
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,910
informational draft how it went<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

1092
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we actually want people to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it and</font>

1093
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report back in five years as to</font>

1094
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,310
where this accessible or not right that

1095
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:41,620
will be great maybe we'll just stamp it

1096
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:43,660
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea go ahead right right</font>

1097
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,310
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said but but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at which at</font>

1098
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,370
which point will then have a distributed

1099
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:50,140
source of ppk okay because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

1100
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:53,650
point the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get that PP k into</font>

1101
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,690
that algorithm now such that in fact no

1102
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,000
one on the wire will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

1103
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,340
whether app redistributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> PP case or I</font>

1104
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a proper quantum resistant he</font>

1105
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,140
agreement algorithm right or so I

1106
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,240
quantum my green book<font color="#E5E5E5"> he agreement valid</font>

1107
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,890
point is that because those PP case can

1108
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,350
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other thing that you</font>

1109
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,879
just predicted existing right nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1110
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,730
the wire observing the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font>

1111
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,070
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have one of them or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1112
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,510
or whether I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know courier USB</font>

1113
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,400
keys around or something to do the right

1114
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:25,120
yeah although post quad these post

1115
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,150
compra Kripke exchanges are pretty large

1116
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,930
that they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pretty noticeable</font>

1117
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:36,750
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> III</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazingly I assume they occur</font>

1118
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:39,580
through the subspace Star Trek subspace

1119
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:41,320
you know so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried with that if</font>

1120
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:45,910
we had some access to subspace there's a

1121
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot easier ways to do things yeah better</font>

1122
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:51,609
given it so so yeah I think I think

1123
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,810
actually because that's one of the

1124
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:56,470
reasons we want to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very easy</font>

1125
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:59,170
to implement so that people to be no two

1126
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">or three lines of code then people are</font>

1127
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,530
going to be adding it regardless if it's

1128
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,299
you know if they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful or</font>

1129
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,830
not it's a it's useful feature so it's

1130
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">always useful to have a one more feature</font>

1131
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:10,330
in your feature list because that might

1132
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,859
be something that customers will look

1133
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all your competitor doesn't have</font>

1134
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,840
that oh that's that's better or at least

1135
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:19,690
yeah he has 73 pay you know lions and he

1136
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,310
has 72 so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better because had one</font>

1137
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,540
more so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1138
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,400
if people are going to be implementing

1139
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,470
it but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used that's the</font>

1140
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,660
next question and one of the things I

1141
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,040
don't want to be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say I</font>

1142
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,049
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to specify</font>

1143
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,980
anything for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ppk format because it's</font>

1144
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:37,690
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> random binary or bike club that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1145
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:47,460
going to be feed into their critter and

1146
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:51,010
if he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in binary or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you strange it</font>

1147
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,440
yeah how do you type in Europe

1148
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:57,370
pre-shared key pre-shared key is a

1149
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:01,810
binary club no ascii ascii usually

1150
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:06,339
chaski yeah yeah but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> but my</font>

1151
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:09,160
format is not saying that he's yeah that

1152
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,020
that I mean I mean it's good yeah in

1153
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:15,399
here we actually more expect it to be

1154
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:16,690
binary than string like insert key it's

1155
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,040
actually used quite often they are

1156
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually you know just you know strings</font>

1157
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,450
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I make me a tasty gold</font>

1158
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:26,890
yeah so so but with it here i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

1159
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,870
x-ray expert tend to be more like a

1160
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:30,730
binary option and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1161
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:32,500
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it i would like to</font>

1162
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:36,280
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying at me i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1163
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:38,980
something now in a protocol that we can

1164
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,500
plug in that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real team you</font>

1165
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,450
know quantum key distribution reckon

1166
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,390
it's later so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run that</font>

1167
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:48,490
first then we get some kind of binary

1168
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:50,350
blobs that we can use here and actually

1169
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:51,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">i guess it would probably be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1170
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,430
that we run it once then they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1171
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:57,460
know 10,000 of these binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> blobs and</font>

1172
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,930
when you use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> PPK is in you know in</font>

1173
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,700
some kind of order and then they have

1174
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,589
some internal format for the pp yeah

1175
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,629
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was personally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting that</font>

1176
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,300
once we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> post card key agreement</font>

1177
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:11,350
we just slap it in to where the existing

1178
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">DHCC DHS it might be there but actually</font>

1179
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:16,360
one of the things is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there as it as i</font>

1180
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,550
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it they're usually quite large</font>

1181
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,140
yeah and you might actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

1182
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:22,090
them all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp or something like that</font>

1183
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,980
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you did leave it to</font>

1184
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,180
limit that packet sizes so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1185
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,700
might be actually this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

1186
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,890
generation the other advantage of that

1187
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:33,250
Patera key exchange have that we're at

1188
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:34,810
with that we don't is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those can</font>

1189
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,620
rerun with before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd actually know</font>

1190
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1191
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,880
with these peeps case because you have

1192
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,380
to know the identity of the pier you you

1193
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:47,020
have there's a chicken<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1194
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:49,870
chicken egg with the pure post key

1195
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,520
exchange there is no not and and the

1196
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:55,049
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was think about here is</font>

1197
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,100
that in Ike we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1198
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,170
configuration is in both ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1199
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,000
actually this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually one difference</font>

1200
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:03,730
in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example pls we assume that okay</font>

1201
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,590
random machine somewhere can connect to

1202
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,990
server and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't share</font>

1203
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:11,200
any configuration accepted root of

1204
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:13,450
trusts but I mean ends it with ssh for

1205
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,450
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I don't expect to be able to</font>

1206
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:19,089
associate from my laptop to your laptop

1207
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:23,140
usually if I yeah you don't have the ftp

1208
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:24,550
and the public and with Ike is about the

1209
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,200
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> attic in most of the cases we</font>

1210
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,290
actually have if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if i talk about</font>

1211
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,160
out indicates not another motion or

1212
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:33,070
opportunistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all eyes from the</font>

1213
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,180
community the comment if I don't say

1214
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but if you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

1215
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">know normal you know authenticated IP</font>

1216
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:39,340
secretary so you are going to be

1217
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,290
configuring both ends which means that

1218
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">your if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not using some kind of</font>

1219
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:46,660
ppk generation from either from you know

1220
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:49,120
you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> time password taking slices</font>

1221
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,279
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their you're doing that you know in</font>

1222
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,540
both ends<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway so that's why I don't</font>

1223
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have any kind</font>

1224
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:59,230
of real format for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDK Tommy Polly</font>

1225
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,380
Apple yeah I strongly agree with tear of

1226
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:04,960
that I think first of all that the

1227
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">format even if it is specified should</font>

1228
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,830
not be part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this document and hold up</font>

1229
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document through from going through</font>

1230
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's important to get the</font>

1231
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:14,560
specified you may be interesting to have

1232
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,629
a separate one about what are different

1233
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,970
approaches to sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> PPK maybe as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1234
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">informational thing but yeah it's</font>

1235
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to be binary and there</font>

1236
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:26,440
are ways that servers have to distribute

1237
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,820
shared secrets now and they are

1238
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,110
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're still going to</font>

1239
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,340
remain different people are going to be

1240
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,720
sharing these in the same way that

1241
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:40,690
they're sharing all of their other

1242
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:42,549
authentication material which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we</font>

1243
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,400
should have a separate document talk

1244
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:49,080
about safe ways to share them but I

1245
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,670
think that's I think let's get

1246
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:56,640
this because this is better than what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1247
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:58,320
have of nothing as you step one and

1248
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,819
let's let's write that document parallel

1249
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be block</font>

1250
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're here and I want to push back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1251
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,970
what Tara said if this is made easy to

1252
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,960
implement and yeah it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be three</font>

1253
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:18,569
lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code but that doesn't really</font>

1254
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,100
add a feature to my product if I'm don't

1255
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:23,340
solve the key distribution problem

1256
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,080
because if we had a good solution for

1257
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,280
the key distribution problem we would

1258
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,560
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> reveal certificates for</font>

1259
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,770
authentication if i had a hundred

1260
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:34,259
gateways and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just easily</font>

1261
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:35,940
distribute the 9900 the pre-shared key

1262
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,590
is that they need for good

1263
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,990
authentication I would never use

1264
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:44,130
certificate certificates are whole mess

1265
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:46,740
of stuff to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah okay so</font>

1266
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,720
tickets are crap okay I can I then asked

1267
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,279
for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative to this approach</font>

1268
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,870
which doesn't involve waiting for the

1269
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,520
next post quantum key exchange it's a

1270
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,569
bandaid in there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should think of</font>

1271
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:03,300
better ways to distribute the keys so

1272
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:04,680
but if we have a solution for that what

1273
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:11,760
are we waiting for for the last four

1274
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:14,580
years no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I no no I like feet I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> q2</font>

1275
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,140
doesn't have doesn't have a support for

1276
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,970
preciate Keith we just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1277
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:23,310
distribution that's probably some

1278
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:27,029
something outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ike Dan Harkins so</font>

1279
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:29,220
uh like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got kind of derailed</font>

1280
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:32,310
here up but as far as distribution of

1281
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:35,040
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so peak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X uh defines a</font>

1282
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,660
symmetric key package now we could it's

1283
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">a nice format to distribute things and</font>

1284
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,740
if you have mentioned on the list if

1285
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:43,529
you've got armed guards that walk around

1286
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,419
distributing these things that's that's

1287
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:46,920
probably what you got to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I want</font>

1289
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,490
I don't actually remember what why I

1290
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,480
suggested he met the terrorists

1291
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,740
suggested something else I didn't

1292
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:59,760
understand what he was saying or I don't

1293

directed by the diffie-hellman output

1297
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,270
then we have this PRF that generates a

00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,220
there's a I a and E and so that's

encryption authenticator and then

1303
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:25,540
there's this skp I and PR which I used

1304
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:29,319
to generate the authentication hashes so

1305
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:31,779
there is it's used in let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me see do you</font>

1327
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:33,790
d you know kamau something like that and

1328
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,640
you know we test at pdk and then use

1329
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:39,370
that sounds like that but ever doesn't

1330
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:43,690
drive SKT normally with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ppk</font>

00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:48,930
post quantum goo you do skd ' yes and

1332
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:48,930
you'll do an sk<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIR ' + p</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i approach</font>

1333
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:59,020
tira would you be willing to post your

1334
00:58:55,270 --> 00:59:04,810
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the list i think i can try</font>

1335
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:10,300
to buy old email from 2012<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah it</font>

1336
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:13,000
might be Markovski ncsa I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1337
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:15,370
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier that um you expected that</font>

1338
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">one sir a nest candidate algorithm came</font>

1339
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,060
along for doing the

1340
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,859
smokey exchange then you thought that I

1341
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:23,099
would just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to swap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in in place</font>

1342
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:25,140
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDN yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my personal</font>

1343
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:27,270
expectation that's just me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also it</font>

1344
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,848
would not probably be not just a lot of

1345
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">self it might actually be on alongside a</font>

1346
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:34,650
key LDC dhcp exchange so that was kind

1347
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,000
of what happens like that it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1348
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:38,040
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> simplified but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it might need to be in</font>

1349
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,050
hybrid with a whatever the desk either

1350
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,150
because we have there might be some

1351
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:45,060
negotiation parameters required people

1352
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:46,800
to start thinking about formats or yeah

1353
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,960
what they hear the protocol cuz look

1354
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,670
like for the birth yeah mixing in those

1355
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,109
yeah but that's a much longer process so

1356
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:57,900
it's by the way I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1357
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:59,910
starting now developing that framework

1358
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:11,369
in advance of having of the list

1359
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:13,680
algorithm specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip lafrance I</font>

1360
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:15,900
Sarah um ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's cotton I talked with</font>

1361
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly before so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all</font>

1362
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,109
in agreement that we can't wait for this

1363
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:20,520
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do something now but this is</font>

1364
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:24,180
certainly a band-aid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1365
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,980
agree so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> my concern with with this</font>

1366
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,230
right now is it doesn't offer any

1367
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,319
forward secrecy so I'm pretty concerned

1368
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:33,690
with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know quantum adversaries so I</font>

1369
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:36,569
think forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> secrecy is a really highly</font>

1370
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,710
desirable property to have and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1371
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:39,630
if we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward on the</font>

1372
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:41,280
technologies work hopefully to roll out

1373
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,359
eventually then I think something like

1374
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,619
that is what we should really keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1375
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,970
the back of our minds<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think you</font>

1376
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:47,339
could probably achieve it with some sort

1377
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:49,348
of ratcheting protocol like signals so I

1378
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:50,609
just want to just put them the back of

1379
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:52,140
everyone's mind let it percolate just a

1380
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:55,549
little bit that this is something that I

1381
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,549
think we should really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get</font>

1382
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,480
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1383
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:05,230
well it is related to that I mean I

1384
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't agree with that statement that</font>

1385
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:13,359
this is a band-aid this is a possible

1386
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:14,980
solution Brian wise I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have</font>

1387
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,180
an opinion and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should stir in the</font>

1388
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,980
ppk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there should be a</font>

1389
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,200
requirement that all the subsequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ike</font>

1390
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:30,190
message is not just should be projected

1391
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:33,399
that's PK not just the ipsec keys I just

1392
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:39,099
told you up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point about Mandy</font>

1393
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:43,869
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a band-aid as I'm too</font>

1394
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:46,359
short I guess so the Google's algorithm

1395
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:49,809
or whatever so as the color computing

1396
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:51,220
stuff advances the I'm crucial that well

1397
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:53,200
this is I'm just going to coach<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mere</font>

1398
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:56,410
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be quantum algorithm</font>

1399
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">that lets them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come out so it might be</font>

1400
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for now but there are the new</font>

1401
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,430
algorithms that will for the weekend the

1402
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:09,430
keys we should take that into

1403
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:13,319
consideration you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally here is it</font>

1404
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:17,740
right a wormhole ah basically free fluid

1405
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:20,920
could leave that so another look like a

1406
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:25,328
long as you help of mathema of entropy

1407
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:29,280
that may be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your PP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey to be fair we</font>

1408
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">should never say never understand things</font>

1409
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,650
so Scott were nearing the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1410
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,239
original time that we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> planned for</font>

1411
01:02:41,650 --> 01:03:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but we still have some time on the</font>

1412
01:02:43,239 --> 01:03:07,599
agenda so maybe 10 more minutes I read

1413
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:10,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we really don't either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

1414
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:15,239
eat it or if you go to consider them

1415
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:19,179
then after a football reelabilities I

1416
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:22,239
think everyone's okay with a note my

1417
01:03:19,179 --> 01:03:24,309
heart to deflect business yeah as a

1418
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,900
chair I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a separate</font>

1419
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:27,880
document for that and I think actually

1420
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,499
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check out the verb we</font>

1421
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it need to make it charter</font>

1422
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:33,129
change for that because I did to get

1423
01:03:31,479 --> 01:03:34,359
second correctly our charter to do

1424
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:37,119
children's but I think it's actually

1425
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:41,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very doable and do it afterwards</font>

1426
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,729
yeah I think that's a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1427
01:03:52,650 --> 01:04:04,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore yeah sure is make sure that</font>

1428
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:11,428
we're not sitting up here exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1429
01:04:04,029 --> 01:04:16,749
we are o people to Berlin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roxrite</font>

1430
01:04:11,429 --> 01:04:18,219
anyways so yeah so I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1431
01:04:16,749 --> 01:04:19,419
get in a new version of the craft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1432
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:21,339
think actually we had a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1433
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arsenal if you actually get can get to</font>

1434
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:25,089
the you know agreement with their you

1435
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:27,099
know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> variax are going to feel</font>

1436
01:04:25,089 --> 01:04:29,439
feeling the ppk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that they don't</font>

1437
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:31,390
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> any version out and then it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1438
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,529
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this I have a lot working</font>

1439
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:34,808
group last call for the document that

1440
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:35,979
well to trust that I'm Darrell paper

1441
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:38,170
again I'll I'll help you write a

1442
01:04:35,979 --> 01:04:44,979
document if you want let's bundle all

1443
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:47,729
this together can't get this design

1444
01:04:44,979 --> 01:04:47,729
three months

1445
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:59,900
if you go back a slide I think I think

1446
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:01,520
Michaels got a point here but I it seems

1447
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,410
like we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to define how</font>

1448
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,119
these are distributed that's out of

1449
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,950
scope we just deal with the bits on the

1450
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,329
wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> but because of that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

1451
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,069
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> define some sort of a format like</font>

1452
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:12,470
and I suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EP kick symmetric</font>

1453
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:15,650
heat format that you have to adjust one

1454
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:18,049
of these blobs to put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ppk into your</font>

1455
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:20,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">your I complementation and then how you</font>

1456
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:24,288
just hope these blobs get moved around

1457
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:27,259
securely is not our problem but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1458
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:29,569
we should toss us pacific 1500 my

1459
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,160
gladness official this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strap or that</font>

1460
01:05:29,569 --> 01:05:34,220
allows for interoperability because

1461
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:37,339
Michael sandwich base64 something like

1462
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:41,390
that so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should just have some</font>

1463
01:05:37,339 --> 01:05:43,160
well-defined format that sent text to

1464
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:46,009
container<font color="#E5E5E5"> container of these things that</font>

1465
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,589
you can do well the nice thing about

1466
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:51,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the symmetric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it you can</font>

1467
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:52,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bag right have a bag</font>

1468
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,859
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can you can protect</font>

1469
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:56,288
the bad now protect with what is a

1470
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:59,380
problem you know that sort of like

1471
01:05:56,289 --> 01:06:01,190
layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the onion but you know</font>

1472
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:05,990
ingesting one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things would be a</font>

1473
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:12,230
nice way to load P<font color="#CCCCCC"> pk's and hear your IP</font>

1474
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:13,788
to employ tation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think well I do think</font>

1475
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:16,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would be good to define some sort of</font>

1476
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:19,010
format for representation in ascii

1477
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:21,890
because we've seen some interoperability

1478
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:23,750
issues where people put spaces or single

1479
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:26,660
quotes in there and they appreciate key

1480
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:29,180
and not all vendors accept that and so

1481
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,589
you got like weird broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs case but</font>

1482
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:34,520
also don't want binary blobs in my

1483
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:35,750
config files so so some some standard

1484
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,000
might be nice but it should be really

1485
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:40,010
simple like<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed like base64 or</font>

1486
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,920
something yet we would prophesied that

1487
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:47,839
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you use this as a string</font>

1488
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:51,349
format you space 64 all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

1489
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:55,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">else all right thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's move</font>

1490
01:06:51,349 --> 01:07:00,940
forward and we have implicit IV and then

1491
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,940
perhaps a minimal ESP

1492
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,199
[Music]

1493
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,769
[Music]

1494
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:03,519
we have a discrete oh yeah it's my car

1495
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:23,460
I Charlie turn it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> then on again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1496
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:25,680
so last time we had three suggestions of

1497
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:28,260
how to negotiate it within the essay

1498
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,540
structures and thing we finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> converge</font>

1499
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:33,510
on using a new transform IDs for each

1500
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:36,510
one of the algorithm so we have a sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> em</font>

1501
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:40,740
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a SCCM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i IV same</font>

1502
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:43,080
for GCM same for<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chhatrapati and</font>

1503
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:47,059
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question whether we want one</font>

1504
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:51,089
for just playing<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes counter mode and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1505
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:55,680
everybody thought not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next slide</font>

1506
01:09:51,089 --> 01:09:58,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing last</font>

1507
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">time since then we've talked to occur</font>

1508
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:04,500
and he mentioned that well you wondered

1509
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:06,390
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were negotiating like negotiating</font>

1510
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,490
it like this because it seemed

1511
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:11,010
inefficient and it is inefficient but

1512
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:13,320
all the other options are even even

1513
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:15,930
worse because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way unknown had</font>

1514
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:19,049
attributes are handled in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the essay</font>

1515
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:20,730
payloads so that it's not great but it's

1516
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably better than the other</font>

1517
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:26,629
alternatives another thing he mentioned

1518
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,850
is that there is a way to do this with

1519
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:33,930
other and Griffin algorithms that are

1520
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">cbc based because so we could have in</font>

1521
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:39,510
the key material extract yet another key

1522
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:42,480
and yet another say<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES key then use</font>

1523
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:45,000
that for encrypting countries and

1524
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,759
because we have the same key when both

1525
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,530
sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we get to sing encrypted</font>

1526
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,100
counter and that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used as the</font>

1527
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:55,320
actual IV for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cbc that does work we</font>

1528
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,970
actually considered it at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1529
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:04,500
then we said now we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to</font>

1530
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that yeah you can you can then then</font>

1531
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,080
it started to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

1532
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there are giving it I think I</font>

1533
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,220
think the keys ago actually bet best way

1534
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in with the different ciphers</font>

1535
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,220
because one of the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here</font>

1536
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,840
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually modifying the</font>

1537
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,810
cipher because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IV is part of the</font>

1538
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,200
cipher and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1539
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:25,060
we are removing that so if you talk

1540
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crypto context is there is you</font>

1541
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,770
know we have a you know encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> cook</font>

1542
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,630
function that gets you know just we call

1543
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:33,610
it and we get in you know encrypted data

1544
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually the IV is actually inside</font>

1545
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,120
that script of context you don't

1546
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:40,060
actually depending on the implementation

1547
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,849
but agreed or appear in this case we

1548
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:44,170
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make modify that</font>

1549
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:46,030
context way that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to cryptos</font>

1550
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:48,700
call we have to keep this external

1551
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:52,300
sequence number and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

1552
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,950
somehow make sure that the crypto

1553
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,360
algorithm actually understands as it

1554
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:57,700
actually is getting different you know

1555
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,950
Ivy's different values for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crypto</font>

1556
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:01,540
sequence numbers are separate for our

1557
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:03,160
son so we have this is like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why</font>

1558
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:05,530
I actually want to do it in it it's a

1559
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,490
separate you know I encryption algorithm

1560
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,380
so because it's going to have a

1561
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:09,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">different type of you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

1562
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can I don't think actually you can</font>

1563
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do with the peeps version of</font>

1564
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:15,730
these because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps where I</font>

1565
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,760
think it actually requires the IV to be

1566
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:21,070
part of the no context Iran and here we

1567
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,390
actually get it from outside so so

1568
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:28,480
that's why I were to get it might be

1569
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:31,750
better to have it this way so since I

1570
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:34,209
think that nobody really wants to do

1571
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:37,090
this for CBC because nobody really wants

1572
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:39,420
CBC going forwards then I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1573
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:42,880
think the document is good as it is

1586
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:24,740
question also how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1587
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:26,780
actually read the draft ooh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1588
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:29,030
have more how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

1589
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:33,679
said comments and reviewed it really you

1590
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:35,240
know only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just which I but last time ask</font>

1591
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:37,460
because I had problem that it was like

1592
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,410
one or two and it they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers so</font>

1593
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,670
now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much much more it's</font>

1594
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:42,440
actually means that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually</font>

1595
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">start going to do home so we imagine</font>

1598
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:57,320
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list so why why is</font>

1599
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:59,300
that using powerful new ID why don't we

1600
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:04,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just having a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for attribute</font>

1601
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:09,080
to see you know that ah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1602
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:11,150
rules for handling and unknown attribute

1603
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,769
is that you know the entire proposal so

1604
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:16,969
we would so to interoperate with older

1605
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:20,560
implementations would have to send the

1606
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:23,630
whole proposed other proposals with the

1607
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,000
indication and then over again without

1608
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:29,060
the indication because otherwise the

1609
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,950
proposal is no good it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

1610
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:34,580
inflate the size of the essay failed

1611
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:38,150
much more reason we have to keep adding

1612
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">these new IDs every new algorithm needs</font>

1613
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:47,089
a new ID I mean if we're not we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to I</font>

1614
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:49,850
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point</font>

1615
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:51,890
supposing that it becomes widely

1616
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:54,520
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the next algorithm that</font>

1617
01:14:51,890 --> 01:15:00,130
comes along we might have only a nun

1618
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:00,130
only I in implicitly version of it

1619
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so anything else on this topic not</font>

1620
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:21,050
shorter than 20 minutes that has

1621
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:23,000
allotted yeah and I think so as we seem

1622
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,680
to be having several people reading this

1623
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,630
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i've actually adjusted</font>

1624
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:29,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and starting working group are absent</font>

1625
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">another angle for these so so we have</font>

1626
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:34,040
you have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks time to</font>

1627
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,179
comment on and very out of it then so

1628
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it good to be adopted as a</font>

1629
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:43,850
working group documents and then we hope

1630
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:49,540
look it going forward all right no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1631
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:53,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet next version or no actually I</font>

1632
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iranians changes you want to do now oh</font>

1633
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:04,030
nah so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a new version</font>

1634
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:12,080
just missing reference if we make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1635
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,520
working group draft in the 00 version

1636
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,410
can have the reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right okay so</font>

1637
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,270
so so i will make a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group the</font>

1638
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:19,970
adaptation call now and starting now and

1639
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">then then it went even it finish you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1640
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:25,820
actually publisher<font color="#E5E5E5"> 00 version of the</font>

1641
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Republic but so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is to</font>

1642
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:36,019
minimally yesterday we did have a time

1643
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:39,080
for that so minimal ESP is about

1644
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:42,470
providing guidance to have a minimal

1645
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:47,450
implementation so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make well to help</font>

1646
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:51,610
developers to have that so well it does

1647
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:57,170
not update nor modify the standard ESP

1648
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:59,480
next slide so basically we go to every

1649
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:03,470
fields and define while provide some

1650
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:07,309
guidance and how to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for</font>

1651
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:13,220
the SPI we we recommended implementation

1652
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:16,850
generate a random spi but for some

1653
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:18,650
constraint<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes random generators might</font>

1654
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:24,100
be a problem so

1655
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:31,339
where if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to use one fixed spi</font>

1656
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:33,140
then we recommend to to have well we

1657
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:35,390
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention that do you have</font>

1658
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,460
some limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so and one of the</font>

1659
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:42,800
limitation is that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

1660
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:45,350
to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to index incoming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packets</font>

1661
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,380
to sa so what we recommend is if you

1662
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:51,590
choose to limit the number of FSB either

1663
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,830
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you you should be have at</font>

1664
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:59,120
least one per session / host you have if

1665
01:17:54,830 --> 01:18:01,190
you're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses one of the</font>

1666
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,019
question we had is do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

1667
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:07,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make some recommendation and how</font>

1668
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:11,480
to perform the lookup for DSA so if so

1669
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:15,670
well we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to we</font>

1670
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:18,530
recommend to have a for unicast nodes a

1671
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:21,350
look at the phone on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPI only and</font>

1672
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:23,960
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the other nodes using</font>

1673
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:27,560
multicast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast you look at IP</font>

1674
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,510
address and the longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> match prefix so</font>

1675
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,760
does it sounds renewables to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1676
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:34,000
this kind of recommendation or out of

1677
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,000
scope

1678
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:47,660
huh DSP said that you choose the spy by

1679
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:50,840
destination address or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose the</font>

1680
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:53,450
essay by destination editors in spy and

1681
01:18:50,840 --> 01:19:08,750
smite you dictate what years with the

1682
01:18:53,450 --> 01:19:13,550
spy as which are ya so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1683
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:15,860
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of look up so I'm just</font>

1684
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering if we should have those</font>

1685
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,210
recommendation into that draft or

1686
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:21,849
currently we just explained the two

1687
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:25,130
lookups but we don't provide

1688
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommendation so I think could be fine</font>

1689
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:32,180
with that however we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have this kind</font>

1690
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:36,080
of recommendation it for the fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPI a</font>

1691
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:39,170
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more well and well if you're</font>

1692
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,120
using a fixed SPI then of course you get

1693
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:43,220
some privacy considerations because then

1694
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,099
someone monitoring the network and

1695
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:48,410
somehow identify the device or even to

1696
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:51,440
yourself so that's thanks for you

1697
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:53,120
commented into the draft well in any

1698
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,830
case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any comment pleased to</font>

1699
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:00,440
provide feedbacks on the mailing list

1700
01:19:54,830 --> 01:20:03,320
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide well SNP paiting and net</font>

1701
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:06,160
setter well the only thing to mention is

1702
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:10,849
that padding is not mandatory if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1703
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:17,050
CBC but then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't recommend to use</font>

1704
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:22,910
CVT so because padding becomes mandatory

1705
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:26,780
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so above the crib well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CV</font>

1706
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:29,740
is optional but it depends on the crypto

1707
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:36,910
you use and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we recommend later to</font>

1708
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:36,910
have a authenticated encryption yeah

1714
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:04,030
so can you really get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1715
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:14,389

1725
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:34,550
and these kind of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually</font>

1726
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,530
something there's this there's this beat

1729
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,400
where you have this in but a negotiated

1730
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:44,930
I que si we have you know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of or</font>

1731
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,190
IP circuits if you have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

1732
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:48,680
source and destination address these

1733
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:51,230
port numbers and protocols and that kind

1734
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:54,670
of things already agreed by both ends if

1735
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:56,870
we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it by you know very specific SI</font>

1736
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:59,239
but they're still sending it in every

1737
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:00,530
single pocket and we always verify that

1738
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:02,900
there's what what is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

1739
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:04,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coming that the diversities you</font>

1740
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:06,799
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

1741
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:08,299
mechanic understaffed about the beat

1742
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,630
mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we actually know especially</font>

1743
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:14,810
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about tunnel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McClatchy</font>

1744
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:16,760
tunnel mode you know semantics but the

1745
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,770
absolute transport mode you know type of

1746
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,540
you know hitters so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> axe I don't have</font>

1747
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:23,600
an extra IP header inside because we can

1748
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:25,160
reconstruct a in our heavy hitter from

1749
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,680
day and that actually would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

1750
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,849
here at Celtic also but it's an idea XO

1751
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,060
you might be talking to think under

1752
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:34,850
about taking that raft off right yeah it

1753
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,430
took but um uh well I don't I wasn't

1754
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:39,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that we were to move a debate mode</font>

1755
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:41,180
so so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the xterra but</font>

1756
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:43,070
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be probably be better so did in</font>

1757
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:47,870
that kind of situation doesn't he right

1758
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:52,190
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then what should we put as</font>

1759
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:54,220
a recommendation sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that but we</font>

1760
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:57,589
have to discuss

1761
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:59,810
Valerie on the and the jammer if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV is</font>

1762
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:03,950
optional doesn't it mean that

1763
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:14,950
authentication is optional in ESP but

1764
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:18,500
the draft RFC 7321 this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mandates it then</font>

1765
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">your question did you say that padding</font>

1766
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was optional well what I say is that</font>

1767
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:30,110
padding can be performed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1768
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:31,940
encryption algorithm or the ESP<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

1769
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:34,219
you have to wait to do the padding so if

1770
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:36,410
you have only if you have a small

1771
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:40,640
implementation and using an algorithm

1772
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:44,900
that is doing this padding you might not

1773
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:47,740
need it to implement it in the SP 4303

1774
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:50,780
says that you had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain text before</font>

1775
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:53,540
encrypting and if you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad the</font>

1776
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:57,019
plaintiff to reach multiple of 4 at

1777
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:59,120
least even if you're the CCM or GC even

1778
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:01,820
if you aging yeah even then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

1779
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,980
go to a multiple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> four that doesn't</font>

1780
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:06,290
exist in st.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Els but it doesn't exist in</font>

1781
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:08,750
ESP of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can say that you're</font>

1782
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:11,269
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a modified ESP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

1783
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:15,200
require this alignment<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is fine</font>

1784
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a good idea but 4303 says that</font>

1785
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:21,920
you have to pad to a multiple for but

1786
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:24,080
then the padding is part of the because

1787
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:27,560
all three is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSP it's something that</font>

1788
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:31,430
the ESP does are for calling ok ok right

1789
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:39,650
that's the way for you feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok then</font>

1790
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:41,960
what is here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong um next slide so I</font>

1791
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:48,320
CD was a comment from Valerie about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1792
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">icv yeah the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment was if I CV is</font>

1793
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:59,360
optional does it mean that

1794
01:24:49,490 --> 01:25:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication is optional in ESP so how</font>

1795
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:07,339
do you do that then if you have no only

1796
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:09,619
food i cv there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

1797
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:11,360
of active attacks which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible by</font>

01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:14,500
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lafayette packet is watching</font>

1799
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,000
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to be quicker reacts to it</font>

1800
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:20,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it would strongly recommend that it is</font>

1801
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> p they optional governor we know</font>

1802
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly how the pictorial rekt rekt</font>

1803
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,949
because all those things oh those

1804
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:31,610
algorithms that are defined our stream

1805
01:25:27,949 --> 01:25:33,110
well not free counter mode so flip a

1806
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">baton you get to flip a bit on the</font>

1807
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:42,500
plaintext very easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so but what I</font>

1808
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:44,360
basically want so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

1809
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:50,420
written actually in the current draft

1810
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:53,809
but what I was stating is that not all

1811
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:58,699
the algorithm as men deterring using icv

1812
01:25:53,810 --> 01:26:03,230
and as as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i cv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not</font>

1813
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:05,330
mandatory knit whole packet that said

1814
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:11,178
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you do in an authentication</font>

1815
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:12,739
you need a nice EV and so because while

1816
01:26:11,179 --> 01:26:19,130
the algorithm we are recommending are

1817
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:26,059
using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV it becomes mandatory so yeah</font>

1818
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:29,179
about the crypto streets so we we do not

1819
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:32,330
define any<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendation on which suite</font>

1820
01:26:29,179 --> 01:26:34,699
to use we just refer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the current</font>

1821
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:40,659
draft and we provide some more text

1822
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:40,659
explaining why security should not be

1823
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:46,610
what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't it should not be</font>

1824
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:50,090
balanced with reducing the size of the

1825
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:54,949
payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> or with power conceptions or</font>

1826
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:56,300
band with a gain question sorry I again

1827
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:59,059
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Valeria it's true that</font>

1828
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,000
authentication is optionally in ESP but

1829
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:04,790
currently photographer think it is

1830
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,420
insecure so ya better to use it always

1831
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:11,840
or use a EAD algorithm yeah i think the

1832
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:14,480
drafts a must it must in an hour but

1833
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,550
it's just commenting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we agree</font>

1834
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,540
on what to we want to say you just

1835
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,540
finding right words

1836
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:24,839
and so well we had a quite long section

1837
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:27,300
on the cryptographic sweet just to

1838
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:33,180
explain security should not be done at

1839
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:36,140
the deep end of other things so we

1840
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:39,150
recommended for example if you want to

1841
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:43,200
not not to implement some specific ash

1842
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:49,739
function so you can reuse the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES daddy</font>

1843
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:52,349
in this draft for bandwidth constrained

1844
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:56,040
avise then we provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

1845
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:58,110
recommendation you can have a sending

1846
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:03,390
payloads that are adapted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the</font>

1847
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:07,589
padding side or well remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IV with</font>

1848
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:11,310
using specific suites are yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1849
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:14,730
that's a don't use a block algorithms

1850
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:24,360
like CBC and prefer counter mode things

1851
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:28,219
and that's all about this draft so this

1852
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:32,580
is if I dressed correctly are trying to

1853
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:34,710
still be exactly standard ESP but just

1854
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:37,380
telling how to how the implementation

1855
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:39,720
can actually you know make things easier

1856
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,310
by doing some tricks like if you go back

1857
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,250
a couple of slides ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's talk about</font>

1858
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next terror of being actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

1859
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">for work if you're talking about next 10</font>

1860
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">or being mandatory but can be both a</font>

1861
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:51,120
fixed value that that's what I saw that

1862
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:53,580
if your image is only talking UDP

1863
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,500
nothing yes you don't have to actually

1864
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:57,510
know take a UDP packet and fight there

1865
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,830
you know protocol number there and put

1866
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:01,020
it there in next header field<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1867
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:02,820
just always feel 70 there that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1868
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:05,190
that's that's what you are good to be

1869
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">using ok so that actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1870
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:08,879
little bit but I think actually people

1871
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a bit confused to actually the</font>

1872
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,650
original you know explanation there<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1873
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:14,940
about that okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 0 this</font>

1874
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:17,160
implementation tricks to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1875
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:18,960
easily not really actually changing any

1876
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:21,330
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach of the wire yeah that's it</font>

1877
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,580
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal I mean I really why this</font>

1878
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:26,610
is like the implementation guidance talk

1879
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,559
about actually not not yet basically the

1880
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:32,969
idea is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is implementing</font>

1881
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:34,139
its own ESP it's not a ESP base or not

1882
01:29:32,969 --> 01:29:36,570
base I mean

1883
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:39,659
it doesn't break anything that's the key

1884
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:43,469
idea so before people start making their

1885
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:46,049
own tricks it's we provide them some

1886
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:49,320
guidance and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not expect to</font>

1887
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:53,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">be here but it was here in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get</font>

1888
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:56,039
feedbacks and wish while we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1889
01:29:53,189 --> 01:30:00,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">movie to forward into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

1890
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">lwi g which is for as guidance for</font>

1891
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:05,219
smaller implementations so watch the

1892
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:07,739
it's it's not the working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> craft</font>

1893
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:09,809
area is it going to be adapted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1894
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:11,579
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group craft there in not yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1895
01:30:09,809 --> 01:30:13,530
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for feedback sword</font>

1896
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:15,389
athlete that we presented here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

1897
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:17,518
that ever actually encourage people to

1898
01:30:15,389 --> 01:30:19,409
read this and you know think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it at</font>

1899
01:30:17,519 --> 01:30:21,959
essen you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimal this</font>

1900
01:30:19,409 --> 01:30:24,749
is how to implement any IPS be in very

1901
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:26,669
very constrained device and not about

1902
01:30:24,749 --> 01:30:29,219
thing about it as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kara</font>

1903
01:30:26,669 --> 01:30:31,050
purpose ipsec implementation that is

1904
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,659
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something this is like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a</font>

1905
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:35,909
minimal I question to document their

1906
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:37,888
text explaining how to do you know ETA

1907
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:39,478
terse I'd of that because you never

1908
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:42,860
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> never want to be under sponder</font>

1909
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:42,860
there but you're sleeping all the time

1910
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:48,570
[Music]

1911
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:50,489
some constraint devices might have

1912
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:52,438
problem Jerry read of this but they have

1913
01:30:50,489 --> 01:30:53,938
the problems in rear<font color="#E5E5E5"> end asleep probably</font>

1914
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:58,979
should be doing anything with split

1915
01:30:53,939 --> 01:31:01,079
security so so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a show of</font>

1916
01:30:58,979 --> 01:31:09,570
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people that have read this</font>

1917
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:16,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">trap 34 can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some volunteers to do</font>

1918
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:19,409
reviews of this draft thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

1919
01:31:16,169 --> 01:31:21,479
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I actually would like to get you</font>

1920
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:23,339
guys send a comment to the ipsec email

1921
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:24,719
is that when you have read it even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1922
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,329
there is nothing you know wrong with it

1923
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:29,399
to go I sure you can find something

1924
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:31,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong but even if you don't find</font>

1925
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:32,610
anything just send an email to the list

1926
01:31:31,349 --> 01:31:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have read it so they</font>

1927
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:38,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody has been</font>

1928
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:40,380
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> readings so I think that's covers</font>

1929
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:48,230
everything we had anybody has any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1930
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:50,550
issues so i think that's it then

1931
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:55,440
anybody has everybody has side side the

1932
01:31:50,550 --> 01:32:14,580
blue seats I guess thank you see in

1933
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Prague GD said set out the etherpad or</font>

1934
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:22,260
drops<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's the status we have</font>

1935
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge this if you have a little too</font>

1936
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:33,090
you know 70s to regard I<font color="#CCCCCC"> etemadi that's</font>

1937
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:36,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">right amber that dream of creating</font>

1938
01:32:33,090 --> 01:33:00,300
dishes tomorrow official looking for

1939
01:32:36,239 --> 01:33:11,009
models yeah I'm connections<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat or</font>

1940
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:13,730
maybe we're making for this notice I've

1941
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:17,900
already lost couple of two male two

1942
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:17,900
monsters yes

1943
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:45,380
oh yes

1944
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,380
you
