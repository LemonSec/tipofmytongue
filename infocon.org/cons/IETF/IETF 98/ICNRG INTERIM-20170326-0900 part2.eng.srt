own and also for having the following

33
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,979
this one simple principle application to

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,260
an architect at your comments because

35
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,580
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> following is a quote here</font>

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,610
that's always my model it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">experiments is a true it is so judge for</font>

40
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:13,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">different application and see whether it</font>

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,779
actually works so big chunk of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

42
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">can search this with you is to discuss</font>

43

with a chef for

44
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,220
and his team about what they really want

and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can serve them best it keeps</font>

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,200
asking one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know do I have</font>

47
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,390
to know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about networking and of</font>

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,129
course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said no your coat doesn't help</font>

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,859
to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and they will take</font>

50
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,590
care whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need we have to</font>

51
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:49,780
supply just for you so therefore yeah

52
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:51,640
yeah oh we have just just for the record

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,470
you're citing fame on whose side in

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:59,410
Galilee<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks for that thank you</font>

55
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,810
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah so applications always</font>

56
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,910
know that the top thing that drives all

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,959
the other needs we have been developing

58
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,430
the new concept that's kind of a

59
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,890
replacing the point of point tcp

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,079
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the transport because that</font>

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,940
distributed synchronization because

62
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,010
generally speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these</font>

63
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,650
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> are distributed so</font>

64
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore is not so much one point send</font>

65
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,680
data to another point reliably but

66
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather among all the distributed</font>

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,700
collaboration sighs how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

68
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:34,299
synchronize the data in the most

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,819
efficient and recently we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with a</font>

70
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,790
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> emphasized of the last couple</font>

71
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years on the wireless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the hot</font>

72
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:46,328
mobility stuff while continuing to

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,450
address the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scaling issues of a global</font>

74
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">scale so one thing I forgot to mention</font>

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,798
Muhammad<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ali area or measurement and the</font>

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,119
way how also<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuously put mussafah</font>

77
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,200
emphasize on the security especially

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,000
usable security who's the developments

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,560
you will see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font>

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,049
community meeting and talk about the

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,510

also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have good opportunities for doing</font>

86
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,460
that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to mention that</font>

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,830
way so we started again using

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,750
applications through opening up of the

101
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,120
the meeting started with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions on</font>

102
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,980
the mobile LG and challenging

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,650
environments and they paint n Save

104
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,220
applications so just for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

105
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,460
mention a few things this is a the talks

107
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,370
and the challenge of the environment

108
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,730
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I think is really</font>

109
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting that is the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is</font>

110
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,090
about low rate communications for the

111
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,840
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> fog rooftop networking the</font>

112
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,840
user Laura<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I will re this is</font>

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,369
actually the work done by a start-up in

114
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,969
the solar area they funded by a

115
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:56,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">Department of Energy they try to build</font>

116
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:00,760
this rooftop Laura mesh network the

117
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,859
first look at that the ITF standard

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">attract they felt that is too much</font>

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,440
highway<font color="#E5E5E5"> weight and they did a google</font>

120
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,740
search and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say thank you go go</font>

121
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,479
google pointed to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then so they send</font>

122
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,220
us an email to say that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

123
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,070
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marvel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and being because that the</font>

124
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,200
figure our application scenario and then

125
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,960
they flew down to our way to check with

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,849
us and start from there we started a

127
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,580
collaboration so they got the funding

128
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because as a subcontractor to</font>

129
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:34,620
help them build this a rooftop a

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:37,240
wireless mesh network purely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> indian i</font>

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,130
think i sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message earlier to the IC</font>

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,349
NRG mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list that the talk about</font>

133
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering the environments this was a</font>

134
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,530
collaboration with them now

135
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,540
open so they said we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

136
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,549
opening the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole little tiny package</font>

137
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,920
size I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think definitely</font>

138
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,820
below 100 s I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> secret for</font>

you can sign the Indian protocol right

141
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,760
you can go with smarts that and you can

142
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:06,210
go large as I don't know however big a

143
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,360
per ticket you want to make it

144
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:14,460
percussionist so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this solar setup is</font>

145
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:18,670
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mesh network they then set up a</font>

146
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:22,690
rooftop yes my wireless network<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah</font>

147
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,820
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at work not Laura's not</font>

148
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,660
nice the other lords of communication

149
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">other the radio technology to build the</font>

151
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,780
monster or is there a lower you know

152
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,610
gateway amano amano yeah you can look it

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,380
up that I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have put the company</font>

name there it's called our prevent sola

155
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,190
yeah you can search on you can find them

156
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:56,530
Rafi yeah so you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

157
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,070
things also about opportunistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks are the we've made a</font>

159
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,400
further progress on the onion

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,200
implementation on riot when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

161
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,500
here he might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you more</font>

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,780
details on that and that the one talk

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,030
about opportunities for Indian you

164
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,059
augmented reality I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a few</font>

165
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,099
more words about that so look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

166
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,140
picture ah I think of the new

167
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,360
applications exciting ones are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

168
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,620
coming you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this before</font>

169
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,240
this picture fifa so what's the

170
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:36,909
difference right the is no longer just

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,700
that you you have a URL go to somewhere

172
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,380
not find information ah what we are

173
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing this we're</font>

174
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,240
really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on this later this</font>

175
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,130
year it is we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these are</font>

176
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,820
augmented reality or what realize the

177
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,320
reality or combination of them are gonna

178
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,320
enhance the daily life

179
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,580
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that don't that well but</font>

180
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,890
look at the UCLA campus I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

181
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,130
right huggy past years now it's a

182
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,500
gigantic place there are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

183
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on you never know what what where</font>

184
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,210
is going on what so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

185
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,360
are seeing here is that augmented

186
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,880
reality allows you to browse the campus

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,890
now what's the difference between browse

188
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,860
and the campus versus you're just happy

189
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,800
you know wowww thought you carried a

190
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,690
teacher<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok browse on the campus means is</font>

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,000
an augmented reality you can just say

192
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,280
that you know with your phone you want

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,440
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about campus information the</font>

194
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,350
data are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way shown here actually</font>

195
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,890
come from all the sources it's not from

196
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">a single particular website but instead</font>

197
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on your interests your context</font>

198
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,780
then that you can really<font color="#CCCCCC"> catch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

199
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,640
information from different sources so

all the different hitter genius are

and the ways of the icing technology

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know or care where data</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">computation functionalities into the the</font>

230
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,620
chipset so that you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

231
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:31,599
this augmented reality and virtual

reality down from the cloud to the ages

233
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,340
and and really benefit you do is

approach of fraud on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the campus and</font>

235
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,720
eventually you know people talk about

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,089
the smart cities you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the cities and now</font>

238
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,100
the limited to a particular web server

239
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not give you whatever information</font>

240
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it wanted to give it where we talked</font>

about now<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for many communications</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">do it not so now the challenge is really</font>

244
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,710
up to the architecture the protocol

245
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,750
stack how we can utilize all this

246
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:15,190
information to bring life into a more

247
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,500
exciting nice the stage security is

248
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">always being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of our things</font>

249
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,970
but chief<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steel pushing us i'm coming</font>

250
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,350
to carry a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more later and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

251
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:28,450
want to say that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the</font>

252
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,940
positive elements so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's pretty</font>

253
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:34,750
clearly two things about being control

254
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:37,630
center it's basically prefer use of the

255
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,670
code a little challenging especially for

256
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,620
people like me who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not touched the</font>

257
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,719
code for ever since i joined you show it

258
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,520
and so this allows you to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> indian CC</font>

259
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,770
other words and bean android without

260
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,199
value to just install the whole thing

261
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,960
and run the whole thing with a couple

262
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,710
button pushers and this time we're

263
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,760
putting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raphaella hack into the</font>

266
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,069
now why don't we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hack the same</font>

267
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,810
way for the android because enjoyed them

268
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support it as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand</font>

269
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,150
without looking at the phone which we we

270
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,279
feel that when users don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the</font>

272
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,390
sessions including the applications

273
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:30,240
Dalton the forwarding there's some more

274
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:34,019
interesting stuff about routing is

275
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Newton called g oh kappa party without</font>

278
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,940
a number of times has been going on but

279
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,190
the durations at progress is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

280
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,430
think geolocation information let it

281
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:54,360
improve the results not in a big

282
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,939
fundamental ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to some new work</font>

about look free multipath routing and

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,570
other things one thing I forgot to

mention inside i'm going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

point the slice tool today when i finish

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,500
website that actually has a pointers to

289
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,890
the recordings talk about the advanced

290
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,230
facilities they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time</font>

291
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,839
streamed the whole meeting as well as

292
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,120
recording this so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there</font>

293
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,339
abouts through whatever the things you

294
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,740
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are interested i</font>

295
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,350
think that the there are two panels with

296
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,310
the earlier thing about security that's

297
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,680
actually a panel with a couple fellows

298
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,670
from a verizon during the panel together

299
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:48,630
with jay and register here yeah and I

300
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:52,769
Lana the Alex a hard man who the

301
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,600
professor at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the universal Michigan he's</font>

302
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">a super busy these days because he got</font>

303
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,060
involved with the presidential election

304
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">security issues so he went through the</font>

305
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,018
converse with whatever things but he was

306
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,420
in the final and it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> give lots of</font>

307
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,550
great comments and that the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> panel</font>

308
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the point about is this a any other</font>

309
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:16,140
agent on the horizon kinda look out it's

310
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,149
part of the panel still here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

311
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,490
also like to see if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

312
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,740
interested to watch so that I thought we

313
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,649
brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of interesting thing</font>

314
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,040
is I particular Jeff work with the

315
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,649
penalty they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tortured us for</font>

316
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,730
asking very very tough questions I think

317
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,560
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with Whitney</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abella</font>

318
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,350
so that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to watch I</font>

319
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,709
think I'm going out of my time let's

320
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:45,350
talk about this so we always at the

321
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:49,880
Indian community meeting will<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

322
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:51,980
wrong cable connecting the feedback this

323
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,320
time the good thing is that like I said

324
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,120
everywhere has a mic so that you not

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,310
know how to pass a mic around and give

326
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,050
it to the next person to speak I really

327
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:04,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">enjoyed the facility tremendously but we</font>

328
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,849
are we going out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time for that</font>

329
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,459
everyone how a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to talk</font>

330
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,880
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we scheduled one hour at in the</font>

331
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:17,540
last one hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half LAN LAN one put</font>

332
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,910
the chair just simply cut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so then</font>

333
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we received some emails all those people</font>

334
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">who didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance to express their</font>

335
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,420
views so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wild message I found</font>

336
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,490
out in my email<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and talking about ah</font>

337
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course this tank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has forum item two I</font>

338
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">join then the median but look at the</font>

339
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:41,240
couple of feedbacks are this fellow

340
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,430
provided is that can we expect expanded

341
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,360
more research and technology development

342
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:50,420
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity I think security to</font>

343
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,000
my personal view it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

344
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,089
fundamental points over one of the

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,290
fundamental points the advantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ICM</font>

346
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carg you know of course</font>

347
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,569
colored many crowns but maybe I wouldn't

348
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a suggestion to grab the attention</font>

349
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:14,270
to security very much because that's

350
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,780
really really important especially for

351
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:21,530
security if you don't start from from

352
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,059
day 0 it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to it so I was</font>

353
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,410
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you would drill into</font>

354
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:31,399
like what what do you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you say</font>

355
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">security will you tell us well will help</font>

356
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,970
where help in building applications and

357
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,860
we admitted in this paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> we publish in</font>

358
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:46,150
2015 is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our the scheme of hedging</font>

359
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,969
trust in the end where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> greatly</font>

360
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,429
admitted that

361
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,130
when students build applications the

362
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:56,309
very first the shortcut they do is the

363
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">eagan lawrence's security now fill in</font>

364
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,360
the signature by whatever junk so they

365
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,820
can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and say what would take</font>

366
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,370
care of security later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

367
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,700
basics tells us that they are not

368
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,610
intentionally not liking the security

369
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,220
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they clearly are the use of it is</font>

370
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,709
really difficult how did how do you

371
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,780
figure out the first of all what does

372
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security means security the first</font>

373
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,879
you Thurman you had to have identity ah

374
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,059
then you have to have certificate or do

375
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,340
GERD I how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort it will take for</font>

376
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,980
you to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and once you have your</font>

377
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,740
certificate and in the end oh I seen in

378
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,669
general allows you to have a highly

379
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,799
granular security that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

380
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,500
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal certificate the Sun</font>

381
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,658
everything you produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside you're</font>

382
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,970
going to further produce it you know the

383
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:51,090
separate certificate one follow each

384
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,940
different applications so that this will

385
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,270
give you the resiliency when the 1k get

386
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:00,000
compromised you don't use all and now so

387
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,039
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have access other people</font>

388
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,620
have access to one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your data</font>

389
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:09,020
does not have do not have access to

390
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,020
other parts of the team so this all the

391
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:15,750
the security people told us of trim

392
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,918
account how many years back the we're

393
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:23,250
famous paper by a Jerry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Salzer puts my</font>

394
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:28,200
advisors<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisor and another person talk</font>

395
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:30,900
about is one in the mall text multics

396
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,110
days they wrote on about the principles

397
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,549
of of a security and I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

398
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:41,879
is this the privilege to say that if I

399
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:45,870
must admit limit the privilege of the

400
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:51,530
the individual on<font color="#E5E5E5"> authority or otherwise</font>

401
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:54,539
the actions right so but so far in I

402
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,428
know so little about security I feel a

403
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,860
little embarrassed to tell you anything

404
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,660
about security<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the fact is everyone</font>

405
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,360
knows right will the tos that's

406
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,730
that's a granularity as you have today

407
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,209
you set up a connection and everything

408
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,580
goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that connection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so called</font>

409
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,320
security cut up key and you go to

410
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,909
website and everything's secured by that

411
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,110
single websites key that's it you trust

412
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:26,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and then everything goes so</font>

413
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:30,370
what we have been doing by watching how

414
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:34,000
the security first get even org is to

415
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,590
recognize the use of security is it

416
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have to really</font>

417
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,919
develop the tools to make the yeast to

418
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,679
make it usable and useful so first of

419
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:48,340
all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

420
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">research we really started building a</font>

421
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,010
certificate system so for people or near

422
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,780
the security can get it of course it

423
00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:01,050
requires verification authentication and

424
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,910
authorization you get a certificate in

425
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,639
particular for the test pipe a little

426
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,040
issue at the one hand you want prospect

427
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,900
to be open for everybody to use not just

428
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the Indian Hugh members for the four</font>

429
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:17,020
other interested parties at the same

430
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,920
time you do not want to just more away

431
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,170
from the security so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

432
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,700
question the way we're basically face on

433
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the databases will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have like dress up</font>

434
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,450
and then along the way we'll build a

435
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:34,960
force to do it like for getting the

436
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:38,620
certificate issuing the data signing get

437
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,540
a verification how you can make those

438
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,239
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> more automated so that</font>

439
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,879
application developers no longer help to

440
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,990
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that'll require</font>

441
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:53,020
side is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started from the trusses</font>

442
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,240
schema it's fundamentally sighs hey now

443
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:59,410
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> help names and names are semantically</font>

444
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:03,280
meaningful so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore the older</font>

445
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:06,910
transfer policies can be defined by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

446
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,800
relation between the key names of

447
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,820
certificated names and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data names</font>

448
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,000
and so therefore the application

449
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,470
developers you don't have to know

450
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,140
you don't have to be a quick toast

451
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,670
expert the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beans that you understand</font>

452
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,020
that what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what's a security policy</font>

453
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:30,210
for your application who should have

454
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:33,350
access at nobu should not and that then

455
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,540
then system world will help you to

456
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:39,570
express your policies by<font color="#E5E5E5"> using this kind</font>

457
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,780
of some kind of limited expression we

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,939
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a use a rubber expression</font>

461

464
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,440
of verification to see how we can

465
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,720
actually formalize the verification

466
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,090
after the traffic policy using a schema

467
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,590
make sure that there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

468

holes but that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too much</font>

469
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">advance them pop it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

470
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,479
that you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a community</font>

471
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,060
feedback that we hire opening put enough

effort into security but<font color="#CCCCCC"> by not doing</font>

473
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and the second point this person</font>

474
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">make is that they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

475
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">then to be on more platforms so we'll</font>

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,530
take those into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our consideration but</font>

477
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:36,419
it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point that you know</font>

478
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,250
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design with something for</font>

479
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,670
the future you really need the community

480
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,280
feedback and together like a look I

481
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:50,280
already did that we need energy to the

482
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:52,830
dishes so we were currently working on

483
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,770
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of contribution guide to</font>

484
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,199
provide so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people want to</font>

485
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:02,040
throw an effort they can figure out

486
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,230
exactly how they can chip in and what

487
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,780
are the things where where are the

488
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,310
resources it will depend on and they

our wages put off but I

497
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,170
a new conference center is how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to host the conference on campus</font>

this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about across the street</font>

500
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,760
maybe from here to here little few steps

501
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,100
off to the communal science building

502
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's how convenient that it will be I</font>

504
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,660
earlier about to say they're really new

505
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:54,899
opportunities coming in earlier with we

506

learned about self<font color="#E5E5E5"> inhale partnership</font>

and I seen that where is H will mrs.

<font color="#E5E5E5">I will I will neither read the</font>

516
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,050
solicitation details but i just

517
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,740
mentioned that in a solicitation they

518
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:40,440
mentioned in a few places spelled out

519
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,860
specifically but today's approach to

520
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,550
security especially in technical fields

521
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:50,429
does not work because because the high

522
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,470
dynamics hydraulics and other things so

523
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,780
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> they called out specifically</font>

524
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,210
to say that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look into</font>

525
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">named the data networking event for the</font>

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:11,190
build the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future resilient the technical</font>

528
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:13,500
networking solutions this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end I</font>

529
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,500
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the fluid and something has</font>

530
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,370
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great start the icing when the</font>

531
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,770
share programs really<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped brought to</font>

532
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,969
the word about and the end and I seen

533
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:30,690
more general to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broader community</font>

534
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:32,880
once after the sharing solicitation went

535
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,970
out there for many people the heard

536
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,130
about and being the first time and you

537
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,170
know the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we got flooded</font>

538
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,290
with other requests the for

539
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:46,280
collaboration and

540
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:48,830
we realized how<font color="#E5E5E5"> little the Indian team</font>

541
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:52,730
can be and so therefore we really call

542
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:57,470
out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh to the broader community for</font>

543
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:59,570
collaboration I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a tight on the ice</font>

544
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,850
cream program I<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in one program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

545
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:06,439
really a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step forward you know</font>

546
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,290
what happens at the result inside on in

547
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,110
putting the proposal together so and

548
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,020
then Tim individuals actually worked

549
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,320
with with other people then we really

550
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:21,170
brought this with rod and we can't

551
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,710
participation like a fiduciary proposal

552
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:27,980
team and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just me and a jack in</font>

553
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:31,160
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> we grab this firm or other 50</font>

554
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,050
members into the proposal team so they

555
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,420
are they now on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden he and now</font>

556
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,730
they will be become angry so we didn't

557
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,070
do what well the other teams are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

558
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,800
proposal teams professor patrick cowley

559
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,550
he worked with a yet another proposal

560
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:50,200
team into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program he actually</font>

561
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:53,510
educated eight other<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 members in</font>

562
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiple campuses about how Indian works</font>

563
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,550
Patrick<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me actually it was sing</font>

564
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,949
like you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> select</font>

565
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,169
something it's catching the fire he

566
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,790
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say much and he would</font>

567
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">just grab the idea instantly they</font>

568
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:10,040
understand it because those people have

569
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,040
been facing the challenges in doing the

570
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,649
wireless of the tcp/ip for years so

571
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,190
therefore once actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain them</font>

572
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,750
that yeah it just got it so I credit him

573
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,730
I said you know you're really spread the

574
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,160
words and he said I didn't have to do

575
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,320
much because that concept is so

576
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,770
intuitive and people understand really

577
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">well anyway i'm over at my time but i</font>

578
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,260
want to say that wow we really have a

579
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:41,240
good start<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that having the</font>

580
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:46,629
ICN from h in<font color="#CCCCCC"> its a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potential that</font>

581
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:49,810
will help in seeing lately and with the

582
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,690
Cisco's effort removing the IPR barrier

583
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:56,060
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looking forward to a very</font>

584
00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:00,530
productive years for the ice energy

585
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:08,990
and very much thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Alicia any</font>

586
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:13,300
questions comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the next is</font>

587
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,300
prakasha<font color="#CCCCCC"> or sorry</font>

588
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,980
[Music]

589
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:33,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's what i was asking</font>

590
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:37,308
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was not able to hear my echo</font>

591
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you so if you can go to the</font>

592
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">next slide and if you want I can repeat</font>

593
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:45,309
that again so this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

594
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,309
interesting and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> relate it back</font>

595
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:52,009
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back when ipv6 was introduced</font>

596
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:54,499
and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that perspective</font>

597
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:56,930
that hey what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really changed in the</font>

598
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:58,848
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> network when ipv6 was introduced</font>

599
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,749
because everyone was quite happy with

600
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:05,329
the ipv4 and they run into the problem

601
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:08,390
from from our analysis when we want to

602
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:10,759
introduce i c'n or name-based networking

603
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it is more or less same problem</font>

604
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:15,289
what we went through when ipv6 was

605
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:18,380
introduced so if you relate from that

606
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:22,339
point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the client has to be</font>

607
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,950
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> either as an Indian client to</font>

608
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:28,599
really take the benefit of removing this

609
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:32,239
overlay but we just described earlier so

610
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:34,849
and and I have worked on the area how we

611
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,190
can introduce the client identification

612
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,380
so what you see here there are two

613
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,140
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> options the option on the left</font>

614
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,839
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can call it a dualistic or</font>

615
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,029
triple istic when when v6 was introduced

616
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,180
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling the the handset as a</font>

617
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:54,619
dualistic if you support be 4n and v6

618
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:59,049
and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is that when we want</font>

619
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:03,049
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce i c'n either by using the</font>

620
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:06,319
embedded we can embed the indian or i

621
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:10,759
c'n name address inside the ipv6 header

622
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:13,099
or we can create an Additional Protocol

623
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:17,059
version where the client is identified

624
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:19,640
natively as a the ICN itself so what you

625
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:21,589
see here the forwarding agent that I

626
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,379
described earlier that it can have the

627
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:26,930
intelligence to to bring the information

628
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">from transport point of view about which</font>

629
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,519
transport is preferable from the cost

630
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:34,788
location congestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr each of these</font>

631
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,008
criteria and from top in terms of the

632
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:39,230
applications preference or the contents

633
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:41,760
preference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to get the</font>

634
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,820
content either receive it or

635
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,210
using Indian versus IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus different</font>

636
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">officers and then the clients capability</font>

637
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,960
could be introduced in terms of two

638
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,270
additional sub function which could be

639
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN function or which could be the</font>

640
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,070
existing IP function what it will

641
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">require is that the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

642
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,710
introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this function we need to</font>

643
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,830
modify the lower layer which we call a

644
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,020
PDC p layer because the that player has

645
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:12,210
an intelligence about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the physical</font>

646
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,220
part from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mac layer and it has an</font>

647
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,780
intel intelligence coming from the from

648
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,750
the content point of view so that will

649
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,750
be the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes required for the</font>

650
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,150
dualistic or or triple estate client on

651
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right side is the native</font>

652
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,870
implementation where the client does not

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,990
have the capability or it want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

655
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:37,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">see inclined so when when we described</font>

656
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:40,290
about IOT type of devices they may or

657
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,020
may not need to be IP aware and and

658
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,520
those clients could be just the IC and

659
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,210
aware clients where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not need the</font>

660
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,090
IP and they could be attached using that

661
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:53,310
see if you can go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide so</font>

662
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:56,280
that was the part in the in the in the

663
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:59,370
client now if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce in</font>

664
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,470
the the base station or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

665
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:04,560
point where the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> get get</font>

666
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:07,669
wirelessly connected what we can do is

667
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,410
that again we see the the protocol stack

668
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:14,340
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to relate it to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

669
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:18,660
number 102 and 103 so point<font color="#E5E5E5"> number 102</font>

670
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:22,470
is when when client made a request that

671
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to be a ICN and when that request</font>

672
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,480
comes to the base station how this has

673
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,820
to be handled and especially in the case

674
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,660
when when the uplink from the base

675
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:36,870
station is is various types this could

676
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,330
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IP this could be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 v6 this</font>

677
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:42,150
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN based or this could</font>

678
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:45,840
be the dualistic so each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> logics</font>

679
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:48,630
when it comes at the base station this

680
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,410
could process that and then it could

681
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:55,710
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out upward towards the the PGW</font>

682
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:59,129
or sgw in terms of

683
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:02,880
based on the transport so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

684
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,400
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide so here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

685
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened if the client comes and make a</font>

686
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,609
request that I am a native<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN clients</font>

687
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,440
that is how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be attached and</font>

688
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,630
that is how i want to send the data and

689
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,599
assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the transport is</font>

690
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:21,480
available as i c'n only then it can sell

691
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to that and in second scenario if the</font>

692
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,140
client is identified and making a

693
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,030
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an IP client and if the IP</font>

694
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,129
transport is available you can send it

695
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:35,460
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP transport and in the third</font>

696
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:39,230
part is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client is identified</font>

697
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:42,210
as heuristics so if there are two the

698
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,710
type of attached request that the client

699
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,310
is making and which is not unusual

700
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:50,609
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure how much you are</font>

701
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,950
aware but this phone what we have it has

702
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:55,440
multiple IP addresses not<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font>

703
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes if you see a a complex phone</font>

704
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,849
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more than eight IP</font>

705
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,930
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is based upon type of</font>

706
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:05,400
devices which are being attaching and

707
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:08,390
imagine about the complexities when you

708
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,099
have eight different IP addresses which

709
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,140
application will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> what IP address</font>

710
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,160
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there is a complex algorithms</font>

711
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:19,470
involved in that so imagine that some of

712
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,868
the devices if there are being

713
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,069
requesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> attached meant with the</font>

714
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:28,800
ICN ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 then we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

715
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,780
the logics inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> baseness and when</font>

716
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,750
this request comes how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

717
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,660
so that goes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 native</font>

718
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:41,339
IP and i c'n<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go to the next</font>

719
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:43,759
slide so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly walk through and</font>

720
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:47,490
I had a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> lengthy discussion with</font>

721
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,160
with our team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our colleagues who are</font>

722
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:53,580
working with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3gpp because in my</font>

723
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,720
opinion we can we can discuss about

724
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:59,910
overlay implementation on ICN and that's

725
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,098
fine but if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take the</font>

726
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,049
benefit of native implementation in the

727
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:08,510
mobility protocol we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work with</font>

728
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the standard what is like 3gpp or or</font>

729
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:14,630
because that's where it will go into the

730
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,160
specifications so what do you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

731
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">right hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty complex</font>

732
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,410
diagram but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it very easy</font>

733
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the first point is that when the</font>

734
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:27,799
when the device want to attach to the

735
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile network it it has some way to</font>

736
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,650
tell to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network what type of client</font>

737
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:38,150
I am and there is a pro there is a field

738
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:42,410
defined which we call a PCO which call a

739
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:46,520
protocol conversion option ie and and in

740
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:48,859
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcie you can define with the with</font>

741
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,930
the IC and based identity or you can

742
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,540
define like a dualistic or triple

743
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:56,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">stacked base identity so what do you see</font>

744
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,090
here top on the message number one which

745
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the attached request that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font>

746
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:04,100
the client getting powered up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

747
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:07,550
trying to attach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network we can we</font>

748
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:10,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">can put this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC oh I fill into that</font>

749
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:13,760
and that will go into the network and an

750
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,880
rest of the messaging may not change but

751
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,360
but those interim devices has to be

752
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,310
fully aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ICN identity and what</font>

753
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,960
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here in the message number 12</font>

754
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,779
you might not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see from back</font>

755
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,850
which is called a create session request

756
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,930
and this creates a sand request will go

757
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:35,480
bit with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel being populated</font>

758
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,460
that a I'm a I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN client and I</font>

759
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,140
would like to attach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so that</font>

760
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:44,210
goes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway and when the</font>

761
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,160
successful attachment is performed that

762
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,800
me that the device is attached to the

763
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">network then the IC and identity will go</font>

764
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,250
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client and and when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

765
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:57,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in in our opinion this will be</font>

766
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> native I see an attached to the</font>

767
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:03,080
network there is no need to only and

768
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,940
then you can you can transfer the data

769
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,069
either you can publish it or you can

770
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,600
receive the data so this is overall

771
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:13,250
summary for this one I have a draft

772
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,890
going in progress and n chair thank you

773
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,680
for allowing me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present today but if</font>

774
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:21,379
if any of you want to join in the in the

775
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,220
draft we would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome because in</font>

776
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,119
our opinion

777
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:28,250
if we if we have a work done

778
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,580
collaboratively probably will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

779
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:33,230
put forward and convince the 3gpp we

780
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,390
have proposed to 3gpp they are

781
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,369
evaluating but I think more industry

782
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:40,790
support is required to to really push

783
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:42,619
for this so if there is any question I

784
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,130
can just take it on that or I'm

785
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:50,810
available for for rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day and</font>

786
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel free to reach out to me so I had</font>

787
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,960
one question because it wasn't clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

788
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,540
me because I'm not a cellular expert at

789
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,630
all that it was clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that it me</font>

790
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,570
the first two deployment scenarios

791
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,570
you're still running a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GTP tunnel all</font>

792
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:09,290
the way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the to the packet core</font>

793
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:12,320
right so all the mobility stuff is still

794
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:14,750
being handled by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard cellular</font>

795
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,630
mobility and whenever you move your

796
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:20,030
tunnel gets moved so the ICN network

797
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,410
doesn't get involved in mobility the ICM

798
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,450
protocols don't get involved in mobility

799
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:27,560
at all and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you just</font>

800
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:30,379
you're either running ICN over IP over a

801
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">GTP tunnel or ICN directly over GTP</font>

802
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,410
tunnel those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first two but I i</font>

803
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:38,868
think that's correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's the</font>

804
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,279
only scenario but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go to them so</font>

805
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,560
this one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to look like a</font>

806
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:47,560
later one yeah I guess I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

807
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:50,420
understand which is this one yeah so

808
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,150
what's the data encapsulation here I'm

809
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:56,540
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out does this are their</font>

810
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:59,810
native ICN messages going between the ue

811
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:03,500
and the node a node<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and then the e</font>

812
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:06,500
node b is i c'n aware yes yes I not<font color="#CCCCCC"> B's</font>

813
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,320
completely i c'n aware and and its ties

814
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,990
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question what mr. was asking</font>

815
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,930
earlier about network slicing in the

816
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">FISA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nereo when the network slicing is</font>

817
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,109
being proposed there are also discussing

818
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:23,480
that can be used some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

819
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:26,660
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than the GTP to create</font>

820
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,430
the slices and to manage to send the

821
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:31,670
traffic so probably that be the case

822
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:35,859
then we may not need GTP we will be able

823
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,859
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use natively on that</font>

824
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's now I think I understand it</font>

825
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:45,230
so what's the protocol that you're

826
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:47,600
proposing from ice you have native ICN

827
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:49,810
messages of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the e node</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> B and that would</font>

828
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">run right that would run on top of what</font>

829
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:57,110
so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of concept</font>

830
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,850
ready yet to demonstrate we are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

831
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:01,430
working on this concept probably in

832
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:03,380
couple of months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so and</font>

833
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:10,210
then we can say that what protocol will

834
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:10,210
be using in place of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

835
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:19,640
one question is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in 5g</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

836
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a proposal for non I bpdus so do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

837
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,109
have any idea and how that is going to

838
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:29,000
be used to detect the good vehicle for

839
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:34,790
ICN or any push em that seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

840
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:37,460
more kind of ideal fine to insert<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICM</font>

841
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:40,160
yeah yeah yeah yes thank you and

842
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:43,460
basically if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember in 3gpp release</font>

843
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,350
13 for the first time when when many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

844
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,350
the industry folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> push for known IP</font>

845
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,270
packet data in the 3gpp because until

846
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,210
that time it was only IP so in my

847
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,360
opinion the ICN could be the the known

848
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:01,730
IP and and there is a provision that the

849
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">next gen network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> g network will</font>

850
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:07,190
support IP and known IP so when we go to

851
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,890
known IP this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see and we can</font>

852
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:12,230
propose to them but the the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

853
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,930
we'll be able to propose is to put it

854
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:16,520
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 3gpp protocol itself because</font>

855
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:24,440
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put it inside the protocol</font>

856
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:26,480
that it will still be only but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

857
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,010
think difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

858
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,770
he space right i mean if at all any

859
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:36,320
clean slate we used to because pricing

860
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:40,009
you can introduce new data frames right

861
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:43,280
and so are you so is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any push</font>

862
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:47,330
right now to do in 3gpp the context of

863
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,570
5g with non IP and i c'n and termination

864
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,990
and they know TN

865
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:54,300
see from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco site I know we have a</font>

866
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:56,220
smaller team to work in 3gpp now then

867
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:00,930
what we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have but we are pushing</font>

868
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:04,620
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this known IP is in a protocol for</font>

869
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:11,520
this transport part and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also for</font>

870
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:14,609
signaling clean the sack<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark I really</font>

871
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,470
like this approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting the</font>

872
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,660
one question that was not clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me in</font>

873
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:21,959
your diagrams when it finally gets to

874
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:25,020
the edge I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the right the</font>

875
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">right-hand edge of the core network it</font>

876
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:32,580
then gets converted to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP or some</font>

877
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:34,110
other existing IP protocols or like I

878
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,819
guess there are other way to phrase

879
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">rushes what do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

880
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:43,890
other end<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of selena see in my</font>

881
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,700
opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in sometime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future</font>

882
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:51,470
right it will be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> native</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ICN or ndn</font>

883
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:54,330
based protocols so especially for the

884
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:57,839
for the data which doesn't have to be

885
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:00,870
native IP so if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the case then</font>

886
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:04,020
from from cellular onward<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you</font>

887
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just send it using the the ICN based</font>

888
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,940
transport but if that does not like this

889
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,100
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to overlay from</font>

890
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,280
their own the IP so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have liked</font>

891
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:16,950
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat way or something translating so</font>

892
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,890
this gateway if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it which we</font>

893
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:22,439
described as a pdn gateway<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third</font>

894
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:25,950
from the right side that itself will

895
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,200
have the capability to to understand

896
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,319
that if the client is natively attached

897
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,419
is an i c'n but the uplink transport is

898
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,880
not i c'n then for that type of

899
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,130
transport it has to overlay but if the

900
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,860
uplink transport is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see an available</font>

901
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:43,710
then don't don't or let just send it as

902
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:46,110
it is but is there also a third option

903
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,840
that because the overlay what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

904
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:53,070
understand for your sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the context</font>

905
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,650
is that your overlaying ICN packets at

906
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:57,420
the gateway to one over IP to the other

907
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,910
end but if the other end is like pure

908
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,190
liquid let's rock a long legacy but

909
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:03,509
today's HTTP server

910
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,620
then it's on an overlay then you would

911
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:08,180
have to translate you would have to

912
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:11,430
break it at the pdn gateway converted to

913
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,660
HTTP / piece of your right yes yes that

914
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,089
would be a third option right cutting

915
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:18,390
yes yeah yeah yeah thank you very much

916
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:20,220
yeah and I'm looking in bed for

917
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,549
collaboration with the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

918
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:26,129
when we started proposed this idea it

919
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:27,960
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a while to socialize internally</font>

920
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,590
and then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with the</font>

921
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,300
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ravi was there we presented</font>

922
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:35,400
to the ITU they liked it but they're not

923
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,110
they standard bodies they just create

924
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,220
the vision document so now we started

925
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:43,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the 3gpp so if we can work</font>

926
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,270
together and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a proposed I</font>

927
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:50,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be the way to get it</font>

928
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:50,810
embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> right into this 3gpp protocols</font>

929
00:51:50,840 --> 00:52:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok thank you ok thank you thank you very</font>

930
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">much and then we're reaching ranch by</font>

931
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,589
the way you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want you to discuss</font>

932
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,600
offline in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we have this set</font>

933
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:15,360
we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some breakout sessions at</font>

934
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,830
then so it's not defined exactly what

935
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,720
they are going to be so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

936
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,490
to come up with something during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

937
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,959
meeting here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that there are some</font>

938
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:26,189
people here that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to join</font>

939
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:29,490
together and work talk a bit but that's

940
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:31,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">an excellent opportunity do that you can</font>

941
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,649
of course continue during the week and

942
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,939
then if you come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something the</font>

943
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:38,490
slider to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that you want to present</font>

944
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday meeting could certainly</font>

945
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,259
find time for that for a quick thing to

946
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:45,360
get I'm please feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

947
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,430
mailing list during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting now if</font>

948
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to exchange ideas and things</font>

949
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:54,870
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's an opportunity that</font>

950
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we'll break for lunch</font>

951
00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:00,440
here and we'll back at two o'clock for

952
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,440
the next session
