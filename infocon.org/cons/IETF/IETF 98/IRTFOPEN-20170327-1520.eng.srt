120
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:57,640
by motivating a bit about the problems

121
00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:01,210
in BGP so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> vtp care is no</font>

122
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,910
authentication over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and so</font>

123
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,940
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the following case that</font>

124
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:12,579
shows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp walks so we have Boston</font>

125
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:21,820
University at a s111 and bu has as a

126
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:26,140
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah so bu has a perfect</font>

127
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,300
one sixty eight dot 122 16 and it

128
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,920
advertises that prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its neighbor</font>

129
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:35,229
ASX and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> sx learns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to which the</font>

130
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,439
IP addresses within that prefix so it

131
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:42,190
would send its data packets down to be

132
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,800
you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that ASX also really</font>

133
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that advertisement onwards to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its own</font>

134
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,459
neighbor so so it appends<font color="#E5E5E5"> its identifier</font>

135
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go out and now its neighbor learns</font>

136
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,450
another out its<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor those out to</font>

137
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,900
each day I goddess within that prefix

138
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:04,720
now since bgp care is no authentication

139
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:08,170
well the attacker can actually provide

140
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,690
the same and announcement for the same

141
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,150
IP prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the victim has two</font>

142
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:16,300
outs to choose from<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it can either go</font>

143
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to out its topic to ASX and then</font>

144
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,698
reaching vu oh it can all<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic to</font>

145
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,099
the attacker both claiming to each for

146
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,589
the same prefix so what would the victim

147
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,649
do in this case well if we choose to go

148
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the shorter out so the attacker</font>

149
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:37,510
would actually intercept traffic coming

150
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:39,900
from the victim so in order to mitigate

151
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,100
these problems called perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> size x</font>

152
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,900
there's a new mechanism that was

153
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,560
standardized called the resource public

154
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:51,160
key infrastructure or the rpki and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

155
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,610
are pki any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps I believe fixes to the</font>

156
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,880
organizations that own them it provides

157
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,010
it will be facilitates to think so it

158
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,980
provides origin authentication in order

159
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,470
to prevent hijacks and it also lays the

160
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,750
cryptographic foundation behind most

161
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated mechanisms like bgp sec</font>

162
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:16,300
that the prevent more advanced attacks

163
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,350
and so i'll talk about both of these in

164
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,419
this dog let me start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off by by talking</font>

165
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how the applica is deployed</font>

166
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:30,130
and performs all doing authentication so

167
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,250
usually rpki is so the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> erica is</font>

168
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,860
usually deployed is that mistletoe

169
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:39,790
deploys the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general purpose</font>

170
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,340
local cash machine it's a yes and that

171
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,960
machine syncs with a globe with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

172
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">globally available repositories and</font>

173
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,900
these repositories all the route origin

174
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,669
authorization records or<font color="#E5E5E5"> walls which</font>

175
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,250
provide this sort of authenticated

176
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,230
mapping between an IP prefix and the a

177
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:01,870
is number that's allowed to originate

178
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:05,590
out to that prefix so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> local cache</font>

179
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:09,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaves this this was and then it</font>

180
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,070
verifies the signatures over them and if

181
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,260
the signatures are valid well then it

182
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,550
creates a sort of a whitelist filtering

183
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:22,600
goal so so in this case that I believe

184
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,820
is 168 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one 2216 should only be</font>

185
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,980
announced or sued only originate from a

186
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:35,139
s111 and and then it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and deploys</font>

187
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:39,580
disorders<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the routers so in general</font>

188
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how how the RPI is being deployed</font>

189
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,030
and it slowly gaining traction so at the

190
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,300
moment of a six percent of the IP

191
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,730
prefixes that are announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh bgp</font>

192
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,950
actually protected

193
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:58,679
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this actually listed in these</font>

194
00:19:52,950 --> 00:20:00,390
databases okay so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me show you how</font>

195
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,520
this allows to prevent the perfect

196
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,160
hijacked so consider the earlier

197
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,799
scenario we have the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

198
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">victim learns two outs to each and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

199
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix well now given that the victim</font>

200
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:18,240
observes is these databases like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Advocate otherwise they can find that</font>

202
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,559
actually al 666 is not authorized to

203
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,809
originate<font color="#CCCCCC"> out for that IP prefix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

204
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,120
the route from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker is invalid</font>

205
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:35,970
and and so it is discarded and topic

206
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,918
would flow down the correct path but the

207
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">applique does not prevent all attack so</font>

208
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,299
specifically if the tiger is

209
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,639
sophisticated when they can they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

210
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:47,730
have to claim to originate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP prefix</font>

211
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,850
they can sort of claim to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be directly</font>

212
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,940
connected or have this this false link

213
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:57,469
to the two origin so they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

214
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,000
false origin in the announcement and now

215
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,240
another victim receives again<font color="#E5E5E5"> two out</font>

216
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case the applique does not</font>

217
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,570
provide any any data that allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to</font>

218
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,440
identify that the attackers are these

219
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,549
false so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

220
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,500
really the victim can tell the

221
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,220
difference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to out its</font>

222
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:26,179
topic to the attacker because the out in

223
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that case is shorter so how how are we</font>

224
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:31,530
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain routing security</font>

225
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,890
well the camp adhigam has two steps so

226
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:38,040
step one is to deploy the rpki and so

227
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,220
prevent hijacking and then the second

228
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,370
step is to deploy bgp sec and bgp sec

229
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,640
protects against false this false paths

230
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,918
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attackers might tied 2-2</font>

231
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,020
claiming the advertisements the way it

232
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">works is well considered the be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

233
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,309
outer at a s111 oh well BTW<font color="#CCCCCC"> Piecyk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adds</font>

234
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,620
this new attribute called the secure pad

235
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,500
well now in the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> is funny</font>

236
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:12,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">even would sign the announcement that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

237
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:15,420
would send to its neighbor ASX so that

238
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,330
would allow ASX to and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now ASX would</font>

239
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:22,410
need to do to to check so check number

240
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,840
one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s111 is the actual</font>

241
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,990
legitimate auditing for that prefix and

242
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,179
the second check is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

243
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">origin actually approved the next hop if</font>

244
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:37,650
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so well then ASX would actually</font>

245
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:40,470
sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add the next stop so it's</font>

246
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,750
unable to the out and sign the new

247
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,290
announcement so now the announcement has

248
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,650
actually two signatures on it and when

249
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:52,649
as1 receives it when asy receives it it

250
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:55,320
would now check<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the origin is</font>

251
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:58,679
correct and then that the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> between a</font>

252
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,700
s111 and a sex exists and also that the

253
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,110
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> between SX and sy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exists so</font>

254
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,120
basically it with the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

255
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:12,030
signatures where the verification would

256
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:15,149
be the number of hops so so bgp sec

257
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,580
allows to identify these false links but

258
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,400
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also presents a significant</font>

259
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,730
deployment challenge it requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

260
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,160
perform real-time signature validation a

261
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">lil</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time signing m signature validation</font>

262
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,360
so outers need to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more effort</font>

263
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a plate</font>

264
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,459
upgraded and that seems to suggest that

265
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,890
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have sort of a long</font>

266
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,679
period where<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP suck is being all doubt</font>

267
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,300
what bgp still<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second</font>

268
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,480
thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do basic actually</font>

269
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,690
changes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp message format and so</font>

270
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,940
that might suggest that during that that

271
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:55,559
long period we're gonna have some

272
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:59,100
compatibility issues and and so what is

273
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:02,309
the what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits of bgp sec and</font>

274
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,129
the password option well so consider the

275
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,470
same topology now all the aces in blue

276
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adolphe bgp sex so almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the good</font>

277
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:14,310
guys at all except for ASX and that

278
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,250
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> s 111 actually can't</font>

279
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,040
advertise its prefix in BGP because ASX

280
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,520
does

281
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:25,870
not know how to handle secure paths and

282
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:30,400
so in a sense a sex actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks the</font>

283
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:38,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP sec pad and it would force a s111 to</font>

284
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:40,540
advertise its prefix to<font color="#CCCCCC"> legacy BGP so</font>

285
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,000
now the attacker can actually do the

286
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,700
same attack as it did before it only

287
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to circumvent the rpki because the</font>

288
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:52,630
victim receives a legacy BGP message and

289
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,830
am therefore again traffic would flow to

290
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:59,020
the attack so really it was shown that

291
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:03,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">underpass adoption bgp sec provides an</font>

293
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:10,390

294
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,060

296
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,669
attacks in BGP advertisements and we

297
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,280
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide some significant</font>

298

security benefits even a partial

299
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,340
adoption of our protocol so that is in

300
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:30,580
contrast to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec while on the</font>

301
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,620
deployment side we like to do some

302
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,419
minimal computations and have them be

303
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,580
done only offline and off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router so</font>

304
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,440
so we want me to change the routers and

305
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,379
also we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

306
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,800
messages so that we want done into these

307
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,410
compatibility issues and so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

308
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:55,210
is very similar to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way al baqi I is</font>

309
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:58,990
being deployed today so we're proposing

310
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do path and validation and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

311
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,610
patent violation walks is very similar

312
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:09,250
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI you have a database and that</font>

313
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:12,580
database allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aes to also list its</font>

314
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:18,240
naval so in our case is 111 would also

315
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:20,649
register that it is linked with ASX and

316
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,140
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that database covers all the</font>

317
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,570
neighbors then the victim can now

318
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,230
identify that there is no link between a

319
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:31,210
is 666 and a s111 and so it would know

320
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,810
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discard that goes out and send the</font>

322
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:40,030
in the correct path so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just</font>

323
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,370
briefly summarize the result that i'm

326

happens in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best scenario well in the</font>

342
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,969
best passer adoption scenario for bgp

343
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">six so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means that everyone adopts</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">PGP 60 everyone supporting but still</font>

345
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,680
legacy bgp messages are allowed so the

346
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,200
attacker can still advertise in legacy

347
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,550
bgp although everyone actually speaks

348
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:55,120
physically sick and you can see that in

349
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:57,070
that case bgp sec actually would provide

350
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,919
around ten percent so the difference

351
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">between path and validation and PGP</font>

352
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,110
second up a third option maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in</font>

353
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:13,210
the even the best case cannot be that

354
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">much so conceptually if al pki allows</font>

355
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:21,190
allows an<font color="#E5E5E5"> asd to to claim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ownership or</font>

356
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,500
prefix patent violation sort of extent

357
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:28,690
that to also authenticate the link

358
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:34,990
between V and D and it would allow any

359
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:37,720
any a yes say say in this case a sa to

360
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,920
check whether the link between D&V

361
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,920
actually exists

362
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,419
so just to to provide sort of the the

363
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,720
intuition as to why this would buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

364
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:55,360
some significant benefits well the

365
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,820
reason is that the average path<font color="#E5E5E5"> length</font>

366
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,189
between a yeses on the inner is actually

367
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:04,540
quite short so it's about four<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops for</font>

368
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,980
air sobs long<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average and that seems</font>

369
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,830
to suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the attacker is</font>

370
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,260
forced to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use and to sort of add</font>

371
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:16,360
another hope to its out then it salt is

372
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:20,169
going to be much less attractive so how

373
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,809
how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent violation reply well</font>

374
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:26,679
very similarly to the RPK you have a

375
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:29,350
database and the local case of leaves

376
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oil but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it also retains this edge of</font>

377
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:36,879
the indicator<font color="#E5E5E5"> I code from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the path and</font>

378
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:40,059
database and it checks the signature the

379
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,120
signatures from for both of them nothing

380
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:46,330
is no Krypto is done on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers now</font>

381
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,360
if that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> through well now that the</font>

382
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:53,168
local cache deploys filtering<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal not</font>

384
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:59,200
originate from a s111 but it also

385
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:06,580
ensures that if a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 111 is on the out</font>

386
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,650
it should be followed only by a sex and

387
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,330
the cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this sort of</font>

388
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,000
deployment strategy is that actually

389
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,199
allowed us today support filtering goals

390
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,840
by of bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertisements by the a SS on</font>

391
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,290
the out so you can use the existing ACL

392
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,260
interface to configure a filtering goal

393
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,928
that would filter anything any that

394
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:33,520
would figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out if the hop following a</font>

395
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:35,740
s111 is not X in this case and in

396
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,190
addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that since you only add this</font>

397
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,990
one old / a s number the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeses who</font>

398
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,740
adopt actually the longer the prefix

399
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,360
says that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> towers and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

400
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,720
suffixes that are authenticated so in

401
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,149
this case if ASX joined us join the

402
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,760
system and registers its neighbors well

403
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,220
now the attacker needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to hop</font>

404
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,870
out to the to the

405
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:04,450
halogen so finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we evaluate the</font>

406
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,370
security benefits that such a such a

407
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,200
mechanism would buy us on today's

408
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:11,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and in order to do that we use</font>

409
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,780
a simulation framework so we have the

410
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,760
internet level<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s graph from Qaeda and</font>

411
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,000
in each iteration of our simulation we

412
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,280
pick an attacker and a victim pair and

413
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,549
we assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> victim adopts both</font>

414
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki so it registers it's it's</font>

415
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:33,879
perfect in the database and also

416
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,039
registers in the pattern database so so

417
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,820
in that case a SI lists that it is

418
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:42,549
linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ASD and then we pick a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a set</font>

419
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,039
of a SS who are doing filtering and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

420
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:48,940
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack strategies we measure</font>

421
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,679
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percent of a SS well full to</font>

422
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,640
take the attackers out so basically

423
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:57,039
that's that actual success<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so let me</font>

424
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,020
show you some results so in this graph

425
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,770
you can see the attack of success site

426
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:06,730
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis and on the x-axis there is</font>

427
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:09,400
the amount of a top is P so the largest

428
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:13,870

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,030
this attack the attacker should not

442
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,250
perform this attack because it should it

446
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,090

449
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,620
where the tiger should switch and just

00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,960
what happens when everyone a dog 3gp sec

457

and for comparison the purple line here

local deployment can provide protection

467
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,190
for local traffic so this is

468
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly important sees many clients</font>

470
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,090
on the x-axis this graph plots

475
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:21,069
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> out quite quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so even with</font>

doing the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that goes down</font>

479
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,178
really quickly and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should switch</font>

480
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,960
to doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hop attack which buys</font>

481
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:38,080
almost the same success rate as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

482
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,750
you could hope for with bgp sec we've

483
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:44,139
also seen seen similar plans in<font color="#E5E5E5"> europe</font>

484
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:48,730
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not just for north america</font>

485
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:50,500
and finally you might ask well why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

486
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,320
shouldn't i authenticate more than the

487
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,850
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked why shouldn't i do student i</font>

488
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,910
authenticate the navels of my neighbors

489
00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:01,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> list them in in this database well</font>

490
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,390
so doing so is much harder because while

491
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,790
you while the operator knows the a SS

492
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,940
that are directly linked to it it might

493
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:13,240
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder to know the SS that these</font>

494
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,480
neighbors are likely to and and

495
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,390
furthermore and you can see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so</font>

496
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,430
here on the graph i would argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

497
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,879
buys you and not that much additional

498
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,640
benefits so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the x-axis</font>

499
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,339
you can see how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops from the</font>

500
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,609
actual origin does the attacker claim so

501
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:36,730
for different amounts of hops of false

502
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:39,190
hopes in the in the advertisement<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

504
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,349
if there is no authentication with just

505
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:47,019
vanilla bgp the attacker can claim to be

506
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:51,119
to own the perfect so it can do hide you

507
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:53,348
can get about fifty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> success I if</font>

508
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,480
if fabric I provides all the

509
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,670
authentication it goes to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty</font>

512
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:06,400
really gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not that much benefit</font>

513
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,379
father from that we have some more

514
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,089
results in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper so in particular we</font>

515
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,799
found that loud content providers are

516
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,529
actually better protected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent</font>

517
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,680
relation we also found that patent

518
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:20,289
violation could could have mitigated

519
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">some some high-profile incidents that</font>

520
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:25,119

521
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:29,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">proved that it is security monotone so</font>

522
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,509
if an AAS decides to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> filtering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

524
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:36,789
can actually get a better out that's not

true<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all auditing security</font>

526
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:43,869
mechanisms so just to conclude my talk

527
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:45,789
so I present patent violation which can

528
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,190
really significantly improve

529
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:51,819

532
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:02,618

539
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:25,720
recommend some some efforts financial

540
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:28,059
auditory in order to gather this small

541
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,589
but critical mass of adopters we should

542
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,349
do the filter in order to get all the

543
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:35,470

may all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same questionnaire and</font>

00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just suggest that you said if you</font>

550
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,039
get providers to deploy this I would

551
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,719
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest well you might want to</font>

00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to Leslie bagel if she's over there</font>

security stuff similar to this you might

want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SOB GP</font>

00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:17,369
and PG PG<font color="#CCCCCC"> b which are all kind of in the</font>

560
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:19,259
same area to some degree my only

561
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:23,400
suggestion would be is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll never</font>

562
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:25,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever ever and it going to tell you the</font>

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,479
same thing when he gets up here going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

564
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:30,989
get transit providers to deploy this

565
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:33,390
won't happen your best hope is to get

566
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LinkedIn Microsoft Google</font>

567
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:42,058
Facebook the big eyeball providers on

568
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:43,739
the edges to deploy this and got and

569
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,169
people who are directly connected to

570
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:49,079
real customers not only real customers

571
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:50,368
but I mean like time warner cable people

572
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,739
like that who provide residential

573
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:55,679
service and business service the reason

574
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:58,499
is contractually a lot of your transit

575
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:01,519
providers cannot legally tell you who

576
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:05,339
they're connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fact of life</font>

577
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:08,519
however as<font color="#E5E5E5"> LinkedIn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell you who</font>

578
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:09,808
I'm upstream to so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever going</font>

579
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a hope of getting this type of</font>

580
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:15,209
thing off the ground it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

581
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to come from the edge in and</font>

582
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:21,448
have people like LinkedIn advertising

583
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:23,819
rpki or some other way whom I up streams

584
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:26,640
are you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get level free</font>

585
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:28,529
to admit to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

586
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,089
connected i'm using them as my upstream

587
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:34,859
right so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just respond so so most</font>

588
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,779
of the internet are<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped so they</font>

589
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:41,819
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to to join us in the</font>

590
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:44,909
system now<font color="#CCCCCC"> but but well there they only</font>

591
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:47,130
have well if you only have one provider

592
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:49,049
than you might be we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

593
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,369
ideas on how to to avoid this issue

594
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe having to talk later yeah I'm just</font>

595
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:55,569
practically yeah you're never gonna get

596
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:01,149
transits to do this that's all mmhmm

597
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:03,779
yeah okay dr. Montgomery nest so when

598
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:08,470
you're comparing these attack results to

599
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:10,569
full bgp sack what policies did you

600
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:15,999
assume or being it implemented around

601
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:19,480
HIV side so we basically assumed well

602
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:23,680
the standout type so we basically a suit

603
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,180
that if you get a secure path and in the

604
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,210
insecure path like is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what you're</font>

605
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,490
asking I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you what would you pick</font>

606
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,619
right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah what what so you</font>

607
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,950
had to assume some routing pallasite so

608
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:38,920
we assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you break ties according</font>

609
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pod so if you get an</font>

610
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,720
insecure path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a secure part so a</font>

611
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,390
fact that's advertised dhabi GP and a

612
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,129
path that<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertised to VDP sec you</font>

613
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,558
would prefer the secure one so in your

614
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph where it says bgp sack but</font>

615
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:57,519
permitting legacy you assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

616
00:40:53,019 --> 00:41:01,058
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no holy sign bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sack path for that</font>

617
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,910
prefix no no so the so that so imagine

618
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:06,999
that the victim actually gets a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp sec</font>

619
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:10,210
fully signed path like but it also gets

620
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:14,049
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp path but the bgp path say is</font>

621
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:17,499
shorter so 0 is always less expensive so

622
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:21,309
so for sure your policy isn't too always

623
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefer no not always break ties bike</font>

624
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:25,210
ties we can secure so i think i think

625
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a key point about that result is</font>

626
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:32,380
it it assumes what a policy is around

627
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:39,519
right so yeah so that that is the that

628
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:42,130
is the policy that miss you hi eric i

629
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,348
was born level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three i I admit to not</font>

630
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,759
having read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper so I'm gone not</font>

631
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:47,319
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you a question I'm going to</font>

632
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:49,859
ask if the paper covers it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

633
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">think i missed it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the presentation it</font>

634
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,519
it's easy it's easy to fake out<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPI</font>

635
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,799
because if you're attacking a s is 666

636
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:00,970
it just adds an AS path that says 111

637
00:41:56,799 --> 00:42:03,999
behind it right they put if I aim 666

638
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say x 111 haven't I defeated this</font>

639
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:06,910
whole thing does that just

640
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,200
paper explain it and I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away I'm</font>

641
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,940
not gonna ask dumb question they that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

642
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,980
my presentation so actually if you do

643
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,859
that then your advertisement would be

644
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,350
less appealing because you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

645
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:23,200
of it would be less attractive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

646
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,930
victim because now you've had to so add

647
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,779
this additional hope to tie your whole

648
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:31,270
scheme relies on short asp to beat this

649
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so there's any a s path padding in</font>

650
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:36,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original 111 you know so that means</font>

651
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,770
by patting you mean that you would

652
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,350
repeat the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> s number yes yeah that's</font>

653
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:43,119
that's it fine so if the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

654
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:46,600
phases of different places on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the out</font>

655
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,990
stays the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think I understand</font>

656
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:54,670
blog review paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

657
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:56,709
boy sadness I have two questions the

658
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,770
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is if I understand you're</font>

659
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:03,580
right then the database what I have to

660
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:05,890
maintain is fairly large because I don't

661
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,020
only have one originator i have many

662
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:12,180
originators and every originator to

663
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,770
store or to parse that particular peer

664
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,669
therefore the policy processing becomes

665
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:20,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger so the</font>

666
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,020
interesting thing here would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

667
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,118
the overhead processing just for the

668
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,640
policy additional policies what you have

669
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,810
to know inject into the router that's

670
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:36,190
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sorry number two is your</font>

671
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:39,220
graph shows basically that you only are

672
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:42,730
better in one two and three hops pretty

673
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,500
much so the average path lengths as far

674
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:49,480
as i remember is<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three point</font>

675
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:52,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that so the a s</font>

676
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:57,010
that basically a testing was a 666

677
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,340
already has a punishment of 11 hub so

678
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:03,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore the it doesn't win over three</font>

679
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">hops it only bends over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two hops but</font>

680
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:09,210
basically makes a path relatively short

681
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:16,020
some other question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what is the gain</font>

682
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you make considering all these</font>

683
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:23,480
together with normally when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i already am</font>

684
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:27,110
the main PHP sec so i can buddy<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

685
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,030
secure path and have a secured one can I

686
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:34,520
have an unsecured one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always would go</font>

687
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:37,670
with the security well ok so i guess for

688
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,470
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question i would argue that it</font>

689
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,770
is less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what you would keep to</font>

690
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,480
maintain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BPL outside so a the</font>

691
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:46,130
database size if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're worried about</font>

692
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,960
the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have you have pasted</font>

693
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,050
likely the databases we have for every

694
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,070
origin you have mmm you have the

695
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:57,020
outgoing edges site so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the way</font>

696
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,630
how I understood it is that you that you

697
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:02,930
have a policy processing for every

698
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:07,640
incoming original<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain so forever</font>

699
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:10,129
your your Europe policy has to be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

700
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,900
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm yeah i don't i'm not</font>

701
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,390
really deep into the lunacy processing

702
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,390
but just from my imagination<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

703
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,730
think that I would have an awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

704
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:21,740
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to process to even get</font>

705
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point to say hey yes I can take</font>

706
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,750
that well so think about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

707
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:28,460
policies similarly you would have for

708
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,030
the RPK right you would have for each

709
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:35,420
prefix you would have an in a s number

710
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:38,540
right so we're saying for each is number

711
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:42,140
have a regular expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> that describes</font>

712
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:44,690
its neighbors I yeah but you do you say

713
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you still keep rpki so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

714
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep our big guy so now i have already</font>

715
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:53,150
the policies for rpki i know i have just

716
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:55,460
a policy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember also like so the</font>

717
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,260
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a s numbers on the Internet is</font>

718
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually smaller than the number of</font>

719
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,990
prefixes I'm not saying it won't have an

720
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,880
overhead but the overhead that you're

721
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,950
paying for the RPK<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the amount of</font>

722
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,870
data is that you the amount of state

723
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,180
that you need to keep for doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpi</font>

724
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:13,520
filtering is actually about an order of

725
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,259
magnitude more than what you need to do

726
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">this mechanism so you only thing what I</font>

727
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,620
say it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to maybe</font>

728
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,299
make some some measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah</font>

729
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,700
just to come back and say okay then

730
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,550
actually the processing overhead what we

731
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,259
would expect yeah yeah I know Arabian so

732
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,790
he didn't experiment with with real

733
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:33,140
hardware now for the second question yet

734
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,210
so the entire

735
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,279
I guess gang comes from making the

736
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,849
attacker use this additional hope and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

737
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:44,260
would argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually makes</font>

738
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:44,260
makes a big difference in politics<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

739
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:51,169
guard our own home<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco hey um i</font>

740
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,879
actually have a same question as the two

741
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,940
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have one is what Russ</font>

742
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,339
brought up about the deployment useless

743
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,319
right where can one at the night I can

744
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:03,859
hang out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some time and we have</font>

745
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,480
not seen massive deployment for it part

746
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:07,970
of the reason is the upstream service

747
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,250
providers do not want her<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly it so</font>

748
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:14,808
what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about like from a</font>

749
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:17,390
deployment point of view yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

750
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyes are really sort of imagined there</font>

751
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:22,069
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS is at the core of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

752
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,769
doing the filtering not as much as

753
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:27,170
registering themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

754
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:30,379
database well if you are content

755
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,510
provider then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's using your your</font>

756
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,210
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you you're not providing any</font>

757
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:38,269
doesn't services right but it is in your

758
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:41,599
interest to to deliver your content

759
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:43,490
quickly right now keeping it centralized

760
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,599
like a database on it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

761
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,078
provider rather than actually

762
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:50,299
distributing the information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

763
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,519
boys are you asking can we distribute

764
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:55,910
this data is data bases yeah we actually

765
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:58,098
we are thinking of that yeah yeah the

766
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,779
second question I had was similar to the

767
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:02,599
gentleman in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of me was the</font>

768
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:05,839
performance impact actually implemented

769
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:08,089
it on cisco hardware there is a hit of

770
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,799
course when you have to do the then you

771
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:12,200
have to do the comparison<font color="#E5E5E5"> what every</font>

772
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:13,730
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> for millions of prefixes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I</font>

773
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll be good to see what's the</font>

774
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,140
difference you will see that your idea

775
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:20,089
versus what we already so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

776
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,970
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat with you offline about that</font>

777
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:25,519
we actually read<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so we did not we</font>

778
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,848
tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in software but not in harder</font>

779
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:34,368
so it should be interesting to to check

780
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:36,769
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexandra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> azimuth for film</font>

781
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:39,079
character lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah could you please</font>

782
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:42,680
correct me if the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> improvement</font>

783
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:45,230
company to applique is this if I want to

784
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">hijack your network a new trade one</font>

785
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:50,760
mohawk

786
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:53,640
hmm yeah is the only difference yeah and

787
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,859
what is the reason so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font>

788
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so uh okay i will cut yet the</font>

789
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:03,598
network name on my app streams hmm will

790
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:07,369
choose my my previous yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

791
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:11,550
whatever a length of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> e nice path</font>

792
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:13,830
because they will because a bgp

793
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,710
unfortunately it's not a distance vector

794
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:20,339
protocol mm-hmm it's more about model of

795
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:23,730
priorities yeah and so when I will kayak

796
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:27,869
your network all my providers director

797
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:30,390
or under it will choose my announced and

798
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">still if I have for example a level</font>

799
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">three will choose my prefix I will have</font>

800
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:39,390
a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and so I will reach</font>

801
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:42,119
my goal right so this actually came

802
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,400
comes to play in our in our simulation

803
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,130
so we did take into account so the

804
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,910
inferred being felt business relations

805
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:53,310
between between these a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS so if you</font>

806
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,710
know one AS IS<font color="#CCCCCC"> thieves an advertisement</font>

807
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:58,770
for Miss customer we did assume that is

808
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:02,940
going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over over the other</font>

809
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:05,550
basically my point is that even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

810
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,710
will affect ten percent of Internet it

811
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:10,650
could be ten percent or ten percenter of

812
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:13,560
a very important part of angel oh isn't

813
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:15,980
so ya know the different alkenyl systems

814
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:20,759
have different reachable different

815
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:23,280
customer base and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would rather</font>

816
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,190
think twice before making additional

817
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,560
security mechanisms well okay so you I

818
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,930
in the sense that ten percent of the

819
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:36,060
Indian<font color="#E5E5E5"> might might consist of very</font>

820
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:40,290
important very important users I yeah so

821
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:43,349
we didn't weigh the the a SS I<font color="#CCCCCC"> no metric</font>

822
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:46,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">with we basically counted the number of</font>

823
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:48,900
faces that would be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font>

824
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,760
to add to the simulation framework in

825
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,930
order to sort of rank the attack yeah

826
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:59,580
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I have no intuition</font>

827
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:01,019
about with this ten percent p and the

828
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,089
the best ones are not

829
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:17,968
be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elstree</font>

830
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be important part they think talk</font>

831
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:22,890
to the mic I understand you're also

832
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:25,380
presenting another session in the ITF so

833
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in here this again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

834
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:31,019
routing area is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

835
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so next is Alastair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> king talk</font>

836
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:37,428
about bgp strip thank you very much

837
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:42,589
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still on time actually so that's</font>

838
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,660
so a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't give their</font>

839
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,580
names of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike when you come up make</font>

840
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,960
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give your names I've actually</font>

841
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,960
taking notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ether path</font>

842
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:51,549
hey good afternoon you guys can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear me</font>

843
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:53,559
all right yeah so I'm Alistair King from

844
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:56,230
kada this is the Center for Applied

845
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:59,049
internet data analysis at UC San Diego

846
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:01,029
and I have the real the pleasure of

847
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:03,730
talking to this afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bgp</font>

848
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:06,609
stream and this is a software framework

849
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:09,369
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> historical</font>

850
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:11,589
analysis and real-time monitoring of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

851
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:13,630
measurement data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is some work</font>

852
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,369
that we presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year at the</font>

853
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:21,400
internet measurement conference in santa

854
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:24,130
monica so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp stream as i said a set of</font>

855
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,710
open-source libraries api's and tools

856
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:29,950

00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,078
now it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been</font>

859
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:37,329
released for about a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half now</font>

860
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,710
we have had several publications that

861
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:40,630
have already<font color="#CCCCCC"> used it from other authors</font>

862
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:43,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think actually you'll see used it for</font>

863
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:45,039
some of his research and so I mean a big

864
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,180
part of this presentation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

865
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really an encouragement to this</font>

866
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,859
community to go out and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it use</font>

867
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:53,230
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your research use it for your</font>

868
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:54,640
maybe peer operations and also we were

869
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,099
learning really wanting feedback from

870
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,808
this Community about you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

871
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:01,390
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see changed and other</font>

872
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:04,269
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so vgp stream we've</font>

873
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:08,259
really tried hard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

874
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:10,720
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple way to do potentially</font>

875
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:13,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">really complex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis of the GP</font>

876
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,879
measurement data we've designed it for

877
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,410
youth by both researchers and operators

878
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,989
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like some feedback</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

879
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,700
some of the operator you know real boots

880
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:23,799
on the ground side of things here we're

881
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,848
certainly happy as researchers but on

882
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:26,890
the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that's we're</font>

883
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:29,710
looking for some real feedback as well

884
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,598
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> also show you how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you when you</font>

885
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,849
using be<font color="#CCCCCC"> trippy stream for doing</font>

886
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,920
research for doing analysis it really

887
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:38,890
facilitates experimental reproducibility

888
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,289
and repeatability and as I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you</font>

889
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,670
know it'll do real-time monitoring just

890
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:48,579
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily as a little bit historical</font>

891
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:50,319
analysis if you keep you data so first

892
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:51,819
you may be wondering you know why why

893
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,109
create this software what's what is it

894
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:55,900
doing what's its what's the need that

895
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:57,130
it's filling so as researchers and

896
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,700
especially researchers who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking</font>

897
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,240
at

898
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:03,759
bgp data we make use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of this</font>

899
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,770
existing bgp measurement data so there's

900
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,270
these two major collection projects in

901
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,250
this space you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of them</font>

902
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,710
route views on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oregon</font>

903
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the ripe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk collection effort</font>

904
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,130
and so between these two they've been

905
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,350
collecting data each of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

906
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,000
for over 15 years now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

907
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:21,700
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 20 terabytes maybe more</font>

908
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected mrt data for the last</font>

909
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,350
decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a half and so we've been</font>

910
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,780
using this data a lot but you know when

911
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,819
we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cato developing these</font>

912
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,820
large-scale platforms for doing

913
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,100
real-time data analysis with vgp we

914
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:39,130
really found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a real lack</font>

915
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,890
of good tooling for processing and

916
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,390
analyzing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp data and so you know when</font>

917
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,620
we would go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

918
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:46,600
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the art</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

919
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,730
something like go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reviews website</font>

920
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,490
browse around find the file that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

921
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:54,070
download it to my server and then use

922
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:55,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP dumb convert that to ascii pipe it</font>

923
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,620
through some kind of parsing script that

924
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,430
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked together for the purpose</font>

925
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:02,410
of my analysis and then of course rinse

926
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,089
and repeat for all of the files that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

927
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:05,980
was interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all right so this</font>

928
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,260
really is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a small snapshot</font>

929
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,910
of that this type of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

930
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:12,550
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make easier with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vgp stream</font>

931
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,600
but it's also capable of doing a whole

932
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,870
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that i'll show you</font>

933
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,140
throughout this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how</font>

934
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:22,210
does bgp stream work if we sort of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

935
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,190
to a really really high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp stream</font>

936
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:26,440
the framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a distributed framework</font>

937
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,470
it's comprised of these two main

938
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:33,520
components the first is the metadata

939
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:35,939
broker so this is a web application<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

940
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,590
we are running an instance of act ada

941
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,670
and this can be easily replicated

942
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,250
elsewhere i'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

943
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:45,310
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on but and then the other</font>

944
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,870
component is a set of user libraries so

945
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,170
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this is software that's run by</font>

946
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:52,060
users on their machines and so what

947
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,950
happens the metadata broker this web

948
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,320
application has this background process

949
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,480
that's continuously crawling and

950
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,090
indexing the data that's available on

951
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,530
these public data archives so the

952
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:05,500
instance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're running at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kada is</font>

953
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:08,530
continuously crawling the route views

954
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,390
and ripe risks archives and it's us it's

955
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve queries about which data</font>

956
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,368
is available there

957
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,930
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to stress here you know</font>

958
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:16,329
this metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> brokers service that we're</font>

959
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">running this isn't storing actual bgp</font>

960
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:19,900
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's storing the metadata about</font>

961
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,420
what's available and it's not serving

962
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,800
bgp data to users the way that the way

963
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the actual data gets served is</font>

964
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,339
instead the user library so these that

965
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:29,619
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> software running on users</font>

966
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:31,779
machines first sends a query to the

967
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:33,670
metadata broker and then based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

968
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,020
response to that query these libraries

969
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,060
will actually go out directly to the

970
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,430
providers archives and pull back the

971
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,839
data that needs to be processed and it's

972
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this over HTTP over the</font>

973
00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:44,319
standard public interface to these

974
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,629
archives and as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is being</font>

975
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,460
retrieved that it's processed on the fly

976
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,780
by the stack of components<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

977
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,710
running again you know on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

978
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,849
of doing analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want so</font>

979
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,170
another way of looking at this framework

980
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:58,810
is sort of maybe in a more rigorous

981
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,910
fashion if we stack it up at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

982
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,710
in this sort of layer 1 here we have the

983
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:05,290
data providers you know route use ripe

984
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk and then the metadata providers of</font>

985
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,759
which our metadata broker web services

986
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:12,250
like an instance of this metadata

987
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,589
provider and then the center here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

988
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,349
have lib bgp stream this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c</font>

989
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:19,029
library that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the core of the</font>

990
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp stream framework and it's</font>

991
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsible for going to the metadata</font>

992
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,670
providers for going to the data

993
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:27,160
providers and retrieving the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

994
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:29,589
then demultiplexing that into a single

995
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,368
stream for these this talk layer this

996
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:35,799
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are your applications</font>

998
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,480

1041
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,779
as i said it'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the metadata</font>

1044
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:29,890
data providers archives pull that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1045
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:31,329
over HTTP and then demultiplex this data

1046
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,390
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming from potentially multiple</font>

1047
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:36,069
sources into a single screen and so in

1048
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,799
this way you're able to configure bgp

1049
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:40,749
stream to retrieve data for for example

1050
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of the route use all of the writers</font>

1051
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:46,749
collectors which ends up being something

1052
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,999
like 300 and maybe 400<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp peers worth</font>

1053
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:50,680
of data a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit all the demultiplex</font>

1054
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:54,009
into a single stream for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1055
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,288
application to process and an important

1056
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:57,819
step in this this d multiplexing is

1057
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:59,559
sorting so we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> best effort</font>

1058
01:00:57,819 --> 01:01:02,949
sorting when we're pulling the data back

1059
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:04,539
from the providers to present it to the

1060
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:07,209
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a time ordered stream to</font>

1061
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:08,140
simplify their analysis and so if you're

1062
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,399
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sorting there's some</font>

1063
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:14,319
more details in the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1064
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:15,969
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you later about that so as I</font>

1065
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,519
mentioned libby GP streams the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c library</font>

1066
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:21,849
has a capi and we've really tried to

1067
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:24,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">make the capi as it is usable and</font>

1068
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:27,249
intuitive as it can be for a capi we

1069
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,430
expose two types of data structures the

1070
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:32,529
first is a record so a record really is

1071
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:35,049
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really thin wrapper around the</font>

1072
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:36,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">MRT record the reason we add this</font>

1073
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:39,190
wrapper is so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can add some</font>

1074
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:40,900
metadata that's not found in the MRT

1075
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:43,089
for example the name of the collector

1076
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:46,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this record came from and in the</font>

1077
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:48,520
collection project for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1078
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:50,859
so because these<font color="#CCCCCC"> mrt records that we're</font>

1079
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,930
wrapping here these can contain

1080
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:55,150
information one record can contain

1081
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:58,810
information for multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> preferences or</font>

1082
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:01,960
multiple peers so in the example of a

1083
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:03,640
rib dump so this is a table snapshot

1084
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comes from a collector the routing</font>

1085
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,578
table snapshot a rib dump record inside

1086
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,099
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> MRT can actually contain information</font>

1087
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:14,290
as seen by multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer so it's all of</font>

1088
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:16,119
the routes for example 21 prefix as seen

1089
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:18,130
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peers of the collector and so to</font>

1090
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:20,440
simplify processing here what we do is

1091
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:22,810
we decompose this information in the

1092
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,640
record into what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elam's and so</font>

1093
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:30,009
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just information about a single</font>

1094
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:31,810
prefix as seen by a single peer so here

1095
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">is some code then this will instantiate</font>

1096
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:37,390
an instance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp stream using the capi</font>

1097
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:39,339
the highlighted part here is perhaps the

1098
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:42,940
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it these</font>

1099
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:45,369
screens first of all we add a filter

1100
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says I only want data from the IRC</font>

1101
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:49,450
06 collector to a right risk collector

1102
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,910
as well as I also want data from the

1103
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:54,009
route views jinx collector and then next

1104
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:55,509
I add a filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says only give me</font>

1105
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the updates information so you know</font>

1106
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,900
implicitly it's saying don't tell me

1107
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,460
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ribbed on Scotty's table dumps</font>

1108
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,260
only give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the update stream from</font>

1109
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,180
these two collectors and then of course

1110
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">we specify a time range that we're</font>

1111
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,020
interested in processing data for so

1112
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:09,910
once we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this instantiation and</font>

1113
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuration we then have the sense of</font>

1114
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:13,118
nested while loops where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first</font>

1115
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,790
iterate through the records from the

1116
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,470
stream and then for every record you

1117
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:19,750
reiterate through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> albums of that</font>

1118
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:21,250
record and so this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1119
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,290
structure the overall structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1120
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,390
API is going to be reminiscent of like a

01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,950
analysis and that's definitely

1124
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,480
intentionally wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model this on</font>

1125
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:36,220
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was familiar in this</font>

01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,490
something that's been tackled and

1138
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:02,890
research and in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it</font>

1139
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,299
required you to do a lot of workers of

1140
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,520
research in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get access to the</font>

1141
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:08,530
data in order to process the data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1142
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,090
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with bgp stream with the</font>

1143
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:11,440
python bindings here and actually we're

1144
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:14,170
able to do it in something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 30 lines</font>

1145
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,540
of code and then what's actually even

1146
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:18,730
cooler on top of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not only</font>

1147
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:20,230
do i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my analysis logic in my code</font>

1148
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've also embedded the data</font>

1149
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,880
specification so as a usual disorganized

1150
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">researcher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this a year</font>

1151
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,810
later and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't need to remember what</font>

1152
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,430
the data was that I process to get these

1153
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,040
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually embedded in that</font>

1154
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">same script so not only can I remember</font>

1155
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,820
but now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hand the script off to</font>

1156
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,890
some another researcher who can take

1157
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:41,890
that use that to reproduce and<font color="#CCCCCC"> reap</font>

1158
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:43,480
repeat my experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know</font>

1159
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally of course the python bindings</font>

1160
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,110
are just bindings for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c library so</font>

1161
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that power</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the performance of</font>

1162
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:53,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> c library but available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout</font>

1163
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:55,690
much more intuitive python interface so

1164
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,700
another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did as a case</font>

1165
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,920
study for using<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp stream we took those</font>

1166
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,330
python bindings and this in this case

1167
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,190
what we did is we are looking at using

1168
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,770
bgp stream in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time monitoring</font>

1169
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:09,550
context and so what we did is we looked

1170
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:12,220
at community-based black holing and so

1171
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:16,330
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the victim of a denial of</font>

1172
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:18,459
service attack makes an announcement for

1173
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:20,109
a prefix that's under attack and it adds

1174
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,790
a special community attribute to that

1175
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:23,290
announcement which requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> at its</font>

1176
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:26,859
neighbor and neighbors drop traffic

1177
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:29,680
destined to that prefix and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1178
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:32,410
pi bgp stream these python bindings we

1179
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,210
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp in real-time near real-time</font>

1180
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:36,368
and as soon as we see one of these

1181
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:39,910
announcements we then trigger trace

1182
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:41,680
routes using ripe Atlas and then watch

1183
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,210
for withdrawal so when we and similarly

1184
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,680
when we see a withdrawal for the prefix

1185
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,570
we trigger more<font color="#E5E5E5"> traceroute so we end up</font>

1186
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:48,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this data set of triceps that are</font>

1187
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:49,660
taken during a black holing event and

1188
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,339
then trace routes that are taken after

1189

<font color="#E5E5E5">the bye Pauline has finished and then</font>

1190
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,150
we're able to compare the results we<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

1191
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:56,350
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and so the results in and</font>

1192
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,430
of themselves are interesting if you're

1193
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:00,400
interested in those take a look at the

1194
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:02,140
paper but the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> here again is what</font>

1195
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with using these</font>

1196
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,560
python bindings and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

1197
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,670
monitoring capabilities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp string we</font>

1198
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,620
actually found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're able</font>

1199
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">24 ninety to ninety-five percent of</font>

1200
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:13,480
these black holding events were able to

1201
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,220
probe the black hole prefix while the

1202
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,080
black holing was still in effect and so

1203
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:19,600
in this way we're able to combine this

1204
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,100
passive control<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane data with active</font>

1205
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,920
data plane measurements and look at

1206
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:29,680
these timely you know these transient

1207
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:31,930
routing policies in effect so you know

1208
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've talked about with our capi we have</font>

1209
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,859
this Python API and we also make

1210
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:38,680
available this command line tool that we

1211
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:41,890
call bgp corsaro and this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font>

1212
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:44,410
based tool and the its job here in the

1213
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp stream framework is to allow users</font>

1214
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,149
to do continuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time monitoring of</font>

01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:52,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">EGP but in more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a looks like</font>

1216
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:54,070
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> or operational capacity and</font>

1217
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,170
so what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it continuously</font>

1218
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:57,760
monitors these this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp data that's</font>

1219
01:06:56,170 --> 01:07:00,430
coming in from the from these public

1220
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,160
data sources and then it runs some

1221
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:05,379
analysis logic and then outputs

1222
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,180
statistics or some some output some

1223
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:10,570
aggregate statistics in these regular

1224
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:11,950
time bins and so as it is probably

1225
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:15,760
better demonstrated through an example

1226
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:18,609
we make available with bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> corsaro an</font>

1227
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,800
example a sample plugin this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

1228
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:23,140
prefix monitor and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin you</font>

1229
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,340
give it a set of IP ranges as this may

1230
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">be your network something that you're</font>

1232
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,640
watches the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp data as it comes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1233
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,649
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> its tracking only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two statistics one</font>

1234
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,629
is the number of prefixes that are

1235
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,120
announced from that address space and to

1236
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:39,010
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of origin a esas that are</font>

1237
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,250
announcing those grievances so we took

1238
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:45,910
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in took bgp Corsaro and we use</font>

1239
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:48,100
this to look at a hijacking attack that

1240
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:50,799
was first reported by dine research in

1241
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">january 2015 so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the italian</font>

1244
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:01,420
y axis<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of prefixes</font>

1245
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,520
that are announced from gars address

1246
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,620
space and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way</font>

1247
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,330
existence of the blue line here we have

1248
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,160
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS that are announcing</font>

1249
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,960
those prefixes and so you can clearly

1250
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">see these four spikes there where the</font>

1251
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,860
number of origin aliases goes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1252
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:16,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and indeed the spike on the</font>

1253
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:18,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventh is exactly the event that dined</font>

1254
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,528
research was reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this blog post</font>

1255
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,389
here and we dug

1256
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:25,329
more into the data and found this some

1257
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:27,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">romanian aes that's also announcing gars</font>

1258
01:08:25,328 --> 01:08:29,439
address space here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know again the</font>

1259
01:08:27,578 --> 01:08:31,028
point here isn't hey we have a perfect

1260
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,948
hijack detection tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hey we have a</font>

1261
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:34,389
platform that if you have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1262
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:36,368
operational monitoring you want to do

1263
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:40,380
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time monitor you want to do</font>

1264
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:40,380
this might be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to start from</font>

1265
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:57,450
and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have 15 years of</font>

1266
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">PGP data this turns out to be a lot of</font>

1267
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">data we said hey maybe this is big data</font>

1268
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:05,430
and so we went and took the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apache spark</font>

1269
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,979
framework bgp stream put them together

1270
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:10,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know make them work happily</font>

1271
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:13,169
together and so in the paper we present

1272
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:14,129
sort of some results<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this analysis</font>

1273
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:15,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go really quickly</font>

1274
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,940
through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of those things couple</font>

1275
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:21,300
of the results we got out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but</font>

1276
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you know the point here is we we</font>

1277
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:26,400
did the work to see how you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

1278
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,020
stream in this big data environment and

1279
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,450
we've also made<font color="#CCCCCC"> available some of these</font>

1280
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:34,290
scripts as templates that you can use

1281
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:36,779
for going a using vgp stream in this way

1282
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:39,810
looking at longitudal analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

1283
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:41,279
measurement data so just really quickly

1284
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:42,480
some results<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this analysis of</font>

1285
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,990
course you know size of the routing

1286
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:47,459
table over time but actually what kind

1287
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:49,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">of surprised me and maybe this book</font>

1288
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:52,609
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> in surprising we ended up</font>

1289
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:54,900
needing to use this routing table size

1290
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:58,740
metric to normalize a lot of our out of

1291
01:09:54,900 --> 01:10:00,210
analyses and it turns out that this has

1292
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:03,450
this heat map really clearly shows so

1293
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:06,360
this is the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peers every peers</font>

1294
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:08,190
routing table over time and you can see

1295
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the expected a curve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1296
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:12,419
at the top and then there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1297
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,460
mess at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom and so these are what</font>

1298
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,870
we call the partial peers so in this

1299
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,390
publicly available data there are

1300
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:21,030
several many peers that are only sharing

1301
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:23,220
a fraction of the global routing table

1302
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:24,750
and so in order to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1303
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,400
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this number of the size of</font>

1304
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the routing table so that we can then</font>

1305
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">normalize our other analyses we have to</font>

1306
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,790
exclude these partial peers otherwise

1307
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:36,030
they end up skewing this calculation for

1308
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:39,540
the size of the routing table<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1309
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:42,480
next we took a look at the prevalence of

1310
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:45,090
transit a esas over time so in this case

1311
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,849
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just defining a transit AS as an</font>

1312
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:49,740
AS that at some point appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at the</font>

1313
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:54,450
edge of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AS paso it's in somewhere in</font>

1314
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:56,790
the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ASX and on the right</font>

1315
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:59,280
y-axis here we have for both v4 and v6

1316
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the total number of a esas that we see</font>

1317
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,740
at each point in time and then similarly

1318
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:06,960
on the left y axis<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

1319
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:10,889
the fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those a s is that we</font>

1320
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,810
classify its transit so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first look</font>

1321
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:15,210
at before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red lines here you know</font>

1322
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,130
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of almost a flat</font>

1323
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,080
linear growth in the overall number of a

1324
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,000
SS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before but the number of transit</font>

1325
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,970
AS IS here has actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> been remarkably</font>

1326
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,470
flat over time contrast that with the

1327
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:29,010
six on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand where there's this</font>

1328
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:31,560
steady decay in the fraction of transit

1329
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:34,170
a esas so it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggested to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that</font>

1330
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,700
this is perhaps because the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1331
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is already close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to one hundred</font>

1332
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:39,120
percent v6 ready and maybe what we're

1333
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:44,250
seeing here is instead the growth of the

1334
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:48,120
edge and v6 I don't know and so then

1335
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:50,010
finally the last thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can and</font>

1336
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,680
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably my favorite thing that</font>

1337
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:54,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp stream is building</font>

1338
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,400
this complex monitoring infrastructure

1339
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:02,490
that monitors the entire internet in

1340
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:04,589
real time 24-7 and we did this so this

1341
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:06,300
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why in the</font>

1342
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:09,600
beginning we developed bgp stream so we

1343
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,940
have these two projects at kada one that

1344
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,190
was detecting or is detects large-scale

1345
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:17,160
internet outages on the other detecting

1346
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:18,780
BGP hijacking attacks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in both of</font>

1347
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:23,700
these projects what we needed to do was

1348
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:27,179
at a fine time granularity rebuild sort

1349
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,380
of this orbit have a global state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

1350
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:31,140
so that we can look for interesting

1351
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,210
events so in the case of outages what

1352
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,980
we're looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our large numbers of</font>

1353
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:37,140
prefixes that have been withdrawn

1354
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,879
simultaneously it could be indicative of

1355
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,790
an outage<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example in the case of</font>

1356
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,010
some extreme weather event a part of the

1357
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,660
country is affected you'll end up seeing

1358
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,960
a bunch of prefixes being withdrawn for

1359
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:51,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area I censorship also manifests in</font>

1360
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:54,860
this way and then for a hijacking

1361
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:57,060
project we're monitoring for suspicious

1362
01:12:54,860 --> 01:13:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefects announcements that could be</font>

1363
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">indicative of hijacking so the part that</font>

1364
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:03,150
I've of the the diagram that I've

1365
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,429
highlighted here are these are some

1366
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:10,170
components that we built on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

1367
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:12,180
stream on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corsaro that we use</font>

1368
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:16,140
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of sort of real-time</font>

1369
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:18,040
analysis and monitoring of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP data and</font>

1370
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,420
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1371
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,100
next couple slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to highlight</font>

1372
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,750
that you know so not only can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1373
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp stream to do this kind of stuff that</font>

1374
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually several challenges that</font>

1375
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:29,920
we ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we chose not to</font>

1376
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:32,320
solve in the core be part of bgp stream

1377
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,750
and instead have deliberately deferred

1378
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,099
to the application because it ends up

1379
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">being that different applications have</font>

1380
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:41,560
different requirements here so the first

1381
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,180
challenge that we came across you know

1382
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,270
so both of these projects that we have

1383
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:49,780
one of the precursor the prerequisites

1384
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:53,560
that we had was to to have a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

1385
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:55,360
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp at a fine time granularity and so</font>

1386
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:58,930
what this means is we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1387
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:01,870
sort of this curve here view of a peers

1388
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:04,300
routing table at one minute granularity

1389
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,680
now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the route views raipur is</font>

1390
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:08,020
projects don't make table dumps

1391
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,700
available at one minute granularity and

1392
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,610
so in order to get this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1393
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:15,550
have to rebuild<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infer the pier state</font>

1394
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:17,620
based on the updates that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get and so</font>

1395
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:19,390
to do this we took<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp Corsaro we</font>

1396
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:22,360
created a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that we called</font>

1397
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:24,720
routing tables and then we use a finite

1398
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:27,009
state machine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know pretty</font>

1399
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,270
easy to understand we take the rib don't

1400
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,610
we take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table dump is the sort of</font>

1401
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:34,000
sync frame and then we apply the updates

1402
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:35,440
as incremental patches to them and so

1403
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
there's some more details about this in

1404
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually did some</font>

1405
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,720
validation against the the explicit

1406
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,610
table dumps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get from this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1407
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that indeed in this process</font>

1408
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:48,190
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these really really low error</font>

1409
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,570
rates<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so then you know we're</font>

1410
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:51,330
processing a ton of data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

1411
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:55,210
from a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different vantage points</font>

1412
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:58,030
and so the next thing that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1413
01:14:55,210 --> 01:15:00,700
challenge we ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end that in</font>

1414
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:02,830
this case was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just data reduction we</font>

1415
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,450
wanted to reduce the volume and

1416
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:07,240
computational complexity of the data

1417
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:08,470
we're processing and so the intuition

1418
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,120
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really pretty</font>

1419
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,280
straightforward is that there's a lot of

1420
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,290
redundancy in these bgp messages that

1421
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,700
we're getting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so even at this one</font>

1422
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:19,900
minute granularity<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we're getting</font>

1423
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:22,420
these inferred peer snapshots every

1424
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:24,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute and so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just simply diff two</font>

1425
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,810
successive snapshots and then we only

1426
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:28,090
publish the things that have changed and

1427
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,530
so actually in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we still find</font>

1428
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you know this one minute</font>

1429
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,950
granularity we see this three times

1430
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,590
reduction

1431
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:38,179
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume of data now when we</font>

1432
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:38,180
compare this to the raw update stream

1433
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then finally the last challenge</font>

1434
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:46,860
that we have it really comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1435
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,820
the fact that we're processing data

1436
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:53,099
that's coming from a set of collectors

1437
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,750
that are globally distributed and so

1438
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,910
these collectors are making their data

1439
01:15:54,750 --> 01:16:00,150
available on these on these archive

1440
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:01,650
websites with variable latency and then

1441
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,700
you know of course sometimes things go

1442
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:05,429
wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't make their data</font>

1443
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:07,590
available at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and so as an</font>

1444
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:10,710
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> here because we want this</font>

1445
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:12,690
global view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the routing system we</font>

1446
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,190
need to buffer these periodic tables

1447
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:16,500
while we wait for data from other

1448
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:18,179
collectors to arrive and so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as in a</font>

1449
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,530
typical synchronization problem we have

1450
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,790
this trade-off between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

1451
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:22,800
data that we're willing to buffer the

1452
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:24,810
latency so how long we're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1453
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,940
wait for data to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available and then</font>

1454
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:28,620
the completeness<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how much data do we</font>

1455
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:31,950
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have in order to be able to do</font>

1456
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:33,300
our analysis correctly and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1457
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:35,370
applications you know you can imagine

1458
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,690
might need data as soon as possible no

1459
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:38,760
matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how complete it is while others</font>

1460
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:40,259
really need data from as many peers as

1461
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,300
possible in order to do their analysis

1462
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so we have these as I was been</font>

1463
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:47,160
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have these two applications in</font>

1464
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of hijacks actually we want to</font>

1465
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,059
tune the system for lower latency

1466
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,530
because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send active</font>

1467
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,390
measurements in response to

1468
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:56,040
announcements that we see in order to

1469
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:58,050
get more information about the hijacking

1470
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,000
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done this and</font>

1471
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,350
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this in a in a system that</font>

1472
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,410
we're able to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

1473
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:06,320
applications that each have different

1474
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:09,480
synchronization requirements with one

1475
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,519
underlying data architecture and so to

1476
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,589
do this we use this sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple or at</font>

1477
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,050
least conceptually simple metadata based

1478
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:18,030
gating mechanism and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

1479
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:20,820
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using our BGP corsaro plugin</font>

1480
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:23,160
that's outputting our peer peer routing

1481
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:25,410
tables these tables come<font color="#CCCCCC"> every minute as</font>

1482
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned and then when I when a</font>

1483
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">corsaro instance publishes a snapshot</font>

1484
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,780
into Kafka what happens is it also

1485
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:35,790
publishes a little bit of metadata that

1486
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:37,380
says hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> published this table it's for</font>

1487
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:39,630
this time it's about this collector and

1488
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,250
then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another synchronization</font>

1489
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:44,010
server that's watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> those metadata</font>

1490
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:45,960
messages and it's the synchronization

1491
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:48,630
serve as we run multiple of these and

1492
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,270
one of them is tuned specifically for an

1493
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:52,260
applications needs and so you know in

1494
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:54,060
that trade-off that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

1495
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">before you might have a synchronization</font>

1496
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,530
server you know for our for our hijacks

1497
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:00,930
example which is tuned to have low

1498
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:03,989
latency so it's it's tuned so that once

1499
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see the first snapshot from up here</font>

1500
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:08,429
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can only wait this amount of time</font>

1501
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:10,620
before it's time to publish whatever you

1502
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:12,420
have available so then it watches the

1503
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,330
metadata as it arrives and then once

1504
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,989
that criteria has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been satisfied</font>

1505
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:18,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">published is another little bit of</font>

1506
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:19,709
metadata into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kafka at which point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1507
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,960
application consumers have been blocked

1508
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:24,120
waiting for that message and then once

1509
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,460
they receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they then go ahead and</font>

1510
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">retrieve the actual data from cuff there</font>

1511
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,320
directly and so in this case we're able

1512
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:34,259
to with this really low overhead per

1513
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,489
application support multiple really

1514
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:38,280
quite different applications have

1515
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:41,429
different end uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sorry different</font>

1516
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:42,870
latency and completeness requirements

1517
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,360
within this one application where we

1518
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:46,590
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to replicate the data we</font>

1519
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,670
don't have to replicate the processing

1520
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:51,660
of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is about going</font>

lower latency access to data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1533
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,969
there's some guys at<font color="#E5E5E5"> colorado state with</font>

back to wait a query bgp data and indeed

1536
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,739
there has been some coordination between

1537
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:34,290
these efforts we hosted a hackathon last

1538
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:37,950
year at<font color="#E5E5E5"> kada in collaboration with ralph</font>

1539
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:39,750
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe MBG c'mon and then you know we</font>

1540
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:44,219
have this ongoing collaboration with the

1541
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:45,600
BMP developers and so in all of this we

1542
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:47,219
really see bgp stream is being

1543
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,810
complementary to this work that's going

1544
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:51,180
on to advance the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the art here</font>

1545
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:53,489
what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is allow users</font>

1546
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:57,540
to gain easy access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any of this</font>

1547
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:59,309
public bgp measurement data with and as

1548
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things come online we want to be</font>

1549
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:00,810
able

1550
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,670
do this in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that requires them to</font>

1551
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:07,680
make a few or no changes to their

1552
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:10,440
analysis code so what's coming up for

1553
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,210
bgp stream we have a version to release

1554
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,070
coming out later this year most

1555
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:17,760
importantly here this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ship</font>

1556
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:19,259
with native BMP and open BMP support and

1557
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,420
where we're currently working actively

1558
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,520
with the open BMP guys to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1559
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,070
support to bgp stream we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1560
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">include some better filtering interfaces</font>

1561
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:29,670
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be sort of slightly</font>

1562
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,710
reminiscent of the BPF syntax here

1563
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:34,050
what's cool about this code actually was

1564
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:36,600
this was contributed last year at the

1565
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:39,330
hackathon so we've done almost no work

1566
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:42,240
to make this code publicly available and

1567
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:44,220
then we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> organize you know of course</font>

1568
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:49,219
ship with performance improvements bug

1569
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:52,410
fixes so outside of code we are working

1570
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:58,710
also on deploying a publicly available

1571
01:20:52,410 --> 01:21:01,620
open BMP collector and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run a</font>

1572
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP router and are willing to contribute</font>

1573
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:09,180
public you know BMP feed to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> project</font>

1574
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:10,710
I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you as well we</font>

1575
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,830
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned at the beginning we run</font>

1576
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:15,840
this metadata broker web service it's

1577
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:17,790
currently a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single point of failure in</font>

1578
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,880
this infrastructure we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1579
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:22,530
replicate this elsewhere so if you are

1580
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,700
capable of hosting this if you would be

1581
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in hosting it also like to</font>

1582
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,230
talk to you like you know we're trying

1583
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,790
to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like load balancing and</font>

1584
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:31,860
redundancy here and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

1585
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:35,190
wanting to add support<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the riper is</font>

1586
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:37,110
streaming service so all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said a</font>

1587
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,210
big part of what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of</font>

1588
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,679
this week is<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from you guys so</font>

1589
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">if there are things here that you think</font>

1590
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,980
should be much shifted around if you

1591
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:46,170
think there are features that there

1592
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,339
should be there that aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

1593
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,840
really like to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you we have</font>

1594
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">some flexibility kind of move things</font>

1595
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:55,170
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and play with the timeline</font>

1596
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:57,330
here a bit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1597
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:58,620
me as I mentioned you know it's it's

1598
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,570
available there there's a bunch of

1599
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:03,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good documentation on the website</font>

1600
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:05,190
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good community on</font>

1601
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:07,440
github submitting issues for requests

1602
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:09,389
and like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would encourage you to go</font>

1603
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,669
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a try other than that I will</font>

1604
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:17,070
take some questions what

1605
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Robert acoustic weapons you see um</font>

1606
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:24,009
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure we will volunteer for</font>

1607
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,870
hosting one of the web apps for you

1608
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:27,400
that'll be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> next and it's also</font>

1609
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:30,550
probably going to be close to at least

1610
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:34,030
our dataset could make sense but i have

1611
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:36,310
a question as well um so especially for

1612
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:38,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called big data analysis yeah</font>

1613
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:41,110
when you want to crunch through say 15

1614
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,599
years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data right and in combination</font>

1615
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:45,040
that with the fact that you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1616
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,920
don't store the data you just match it

1617
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,080
from the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> original so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1618
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,810
researchers here jump on it then we will

1619
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:55,179
serve our data<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times as many times</font>

1620
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:58,090
they are restarting their processes or

1621
01:22:55,179 --> 01:23:02,320
do you the local caching or something

1622
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:04,840
usual so the short answer is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

1623
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,599
do local caching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more I add the</font>

1624
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:11,890
feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> request yes so the more new amp</font>

1625
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:14,199
nuanced answer there is we because we're

1626
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:16,199
pulling the data over HTTP we have a

1627
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:18,849
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go about doing this</font>

1628
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:24,400
one way that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually using at</font>

1629
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:26,050
kada is to have a persistent local cache

1630
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,989
of data and because we have this

1631
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:30,670
metadata broker process in here it can

1632
01:23:28,989 --> 01:23:32,980
actually redirect and we do redirect

1633
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:34,690
local users to attach so indeed when

1634
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,299
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this analysis we're using a</font>

1635
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,559
local mirror of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and then the</font>

1636
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,500
other way which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little more light</font>

1637
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">weighting what we're trying to do for</font>

1638
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:49,080
we're planning on adding at some point

1639
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:51,790
is a let's say container eyes HTTP cache

1640
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:54,730
infrastructure that you can spin up and

1641
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:58,360
it would just transparently work with be

1642
01:23:54,730 --> 01:24:01,449
cheapest<font color="#E5E5E5"> route I don't know if it would</font>

1643
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:03,400
be an option but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if users run their PG</font>

1644
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:05,379
stream locally they contact your

1645
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,599
metadata server and they figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font>

1646
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,040
they need the cash could be local to the

1647
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,620
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's all we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1648
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a local HTTP cache that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1649
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,519
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer and I know if just needs to</font>

1650
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:18,660
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feature but if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is then I'm</font>

1651
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,660
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1652
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:28,450
and the other questions let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask one</font>

1653
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:30,460
um do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this could be</font>

1654
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:32,559
suitable for people who wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1655
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:35,500
operationally<font color="#E5E5E5"> their optimizing routing</font>

1656
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,510
they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of peering points they</font>

1657
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,280
want to gather their data does it

1658
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:41,770
perform well enough for something that

1659
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:46,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be no production and</font>

1660
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:49,210
hardened versus a research usage uh yes

1661
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:50,710
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what metrics</font>

1662
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:54,130
using for perform enough you mean

1663
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:57,640
efficiency or stability what's the all

1664
01:24:54,130 --> 01:25:00,880
all those right yeah so as in terms of

1665
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:03,820
stability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency the the library</font>

1666
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,040
that the framework itself is not going

1667
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:08,500
to be a problem there I think if you are

1668
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:11,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at using this publicly available</font>

1669
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,910
data there is some collection latency

1670
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:14,469
between you know when it happens in the

1671
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">real world and that's available for</font>

1672
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:19,840
analysis this is through these this

1673
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:21,940
current mrt you know website fact

1674
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,250
assistant with with BMP or if you have

1675
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:28,000
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own local data than that problem</font>

1676
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:31,390
goes away thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if that's all</font>

1677
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,070
the questions then I'm I want to call

1678
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:36,310
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring the blue sheets up and</font>

1679
