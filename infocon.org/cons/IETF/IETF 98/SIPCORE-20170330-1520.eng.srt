117
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:05,539
calling for draft so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of a</font>

118
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:10,279
larger effort as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you well know I I</font>

119
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:13,969
suspect most of you are in stir who's

120
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:21,819
not in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not in stir a few people</font>

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm in 125 next place so and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for</font>

122
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:29,330
you I so I the problem that we're facing

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,969
as this is probably one of a few sick

124
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,460
problems that all of us have I is that

125
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:37,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have lots of unwanted calls some</font>

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:43,628
illegal just and unfortunately some are

127
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,629
just unwanted as in the caller<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

128
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:51,498
entitled to call you you're entitled not

129
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:54,889
to like that call I so if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scams</font>

130
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:57,649
but then we have particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> charity</font>

131
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:02,509
called so they are legal in the United

132
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:04,819
States to landlines not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phones</font>

133
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,520
that came out of the notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used to</font>

134
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:10,639
pay for incoming calls and political

135
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,149
calls surprise surprise young survey

136
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,459
calls and then we have a category of

137
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,949
woble calls which actually wanted but

138
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,629
most people at least some people

139
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,709
misunderstand the call they think it's

140
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:25,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">one scam call but this could be</font>

141
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,580
something like your prescription is

142
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:32,089
ready or a school was closed or whatever

143
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:39,198
and I we need to do a bunch of things to

144
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:42,469
do that next so the basic thing is the

145
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:44,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">perspective of ship related things we</font>

146
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,050
have a holster I've heard of signing

147
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,790
cards to prevent caller ID spoofing and

148
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,189
then we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are more</font>

149
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,750
relevant here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

150
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,060
sure that

151
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:01,300
don't get confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effort</font>

152
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:04,359
not in super I'm sorry oh there is a

153
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,270
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> called bear start which simply</font>

154
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,700
indicates that this epoxy has validated

155
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,829
the call ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do store I in now that's</font>

156
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,420
done in 3gpp I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have</font>

157
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,760
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with Adam unless I'm</font>

158
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:25,689
missing a draft I men more depth today

159
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,810
is a survey hoy it called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Type Indicator</font>

160
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,500
should say like survey that allows the

161
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,160
called party to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more reasons</font>

162
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,010
decision as to how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the call</font>

163
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,560
the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that</font>

164
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:46,260
again in more<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely in a minute is</font>

165
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:50,349
that the carriers in general because of

166
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,840
the spectrum of goodness were robocalls

167
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,590
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> reluctant to get into a call</font>

168
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,110
filtering business because they afraid

169
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,790
they filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong calls and in some</font>

170
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,390
cases it's a legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you're not</font>

171
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,420
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that it kind of maybe</font>

172
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:11,500
early versions of network neutrality for

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,540
title<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carriers and I secondly they</font>

174
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,670
just think it's bad business if a do

175
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,589
that babe there's already a fair amount

176
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,949
of controversy because they do filter

177
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:23,230
SMS messages in order to go to SMS spam

178
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,950
and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a number of cases we</font>

179
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,230
are legitimate organizations have

180
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,620
complained that they for whatever reason

181
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,730
get filtered and then I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

182
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:41,290
which is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> done besides kind of a</font>

183
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,600
last call revision next so like I said

184
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:49,030
some carriers will want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a</font>

185
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,050
filtering to the end user or possibly a

186
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:57,790
nap on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user device oh so that's</font>

187
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:00,520
as likely to be a nap as a person so

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,760
again because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a false positive that</font>

189
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,410
they want to avoid and also one because

190
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are going to be cause that some</font>

191
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,709
people will want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

192
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,410
except when some people like to be

193
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,570
talking to survey takers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but people are</font>

194
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:17,469
bored and maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

195
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,960
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nielsen or to a gallop or one</font>

196
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:24,160
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> established survey entities is</font>

197
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,410
actually kind of civic duty I to that

198
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,060
they want to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and so</font>

199
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,069
certain some people just hate them and

200
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,640
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to talk to them</font>

201
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:37,120
but just not a dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> time or whatever</font>

202
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,900
and so we what's one device handling so

203
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,610
you can imagine all kinds of more

204
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,650
diversified mechanisms that you end up

205
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,650
handling so you can forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice mail</font>

206
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:51,010
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting bothered you can just</font>

207
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,949
display some textual information you can

208
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,050
change winging behavior for example I in

209
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,780
the Android and I think iOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Do Not</font>

210
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Disturb feature you might label them</font>

211
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,550
with a low priority so they don't wing

212
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,469
your phone features by weight you might

213
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a local app like I mentioned you</font>

214
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,650
might consult an address book maybe you

215
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,750
put them in there as a whitelist and

216
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,699
negative going through make it i'm dave

217
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,050
dependent all kinds of fanciness you can

218
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:20,710
do but unless you leave / call in some

219
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:23,170
way none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can help you just you</font>

220
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,190
can't build I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only other way to do</font>

221
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is that you knew a query to a third</font>

222
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,410
party are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to say I got this call</font>

223
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,600
from a phone number do something tell me

224
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,839
what it is in it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's obviously a</font>

225
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,050
proprietary and<font color="#CCCCCC"> B it means you now have</font>

226
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust a third party and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're now</font>

227
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:47,199
several companies hire just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to name one</font>

228
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,120
that do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you now have to trust a</font>

229
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,000
third party with your call data we

230
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,190
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the privacy issues</font>

231
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,240
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stir just earlier today</font>

232
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:01,330
I so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that then</font>

233
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to do it on device and locally</font>

234
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,890
way put information that is provided by

235
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,390
the entities that already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

236
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,610
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being called namely the carrier</font>

237
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:16,630
so there's a privacy aspect to that as

238
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:19,030
well next so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I let me be the basic idea</font>

239
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,410
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> rearrange the sly should we</font>

240
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,389
arrange for slide so we're basically

241
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,600
me I'll tell you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> syntax in a minute</font>

242
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:29,370
but you don't remember the most

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,519
significant bit about is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled a</font>

244
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:36,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">numerated label that allows an entity</font>

245
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically the originating or terminating</font>

246
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,128
carrier to label is according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

247
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,319
number of categories but it doesn't know

248
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,199
so at the moment I doubt would be

249
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,620
commonly understood and usual extension

250
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,769
mechanism so it last time when this is

251
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,939
discussed they were I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a number of</font>

252
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:58,209
reasonable concerns that were expressed

253
00:13:54,939 --> 00:14:00,670
so let me see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can be fair in</font>

254
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,430
summarizing bows and maybe give you my

255
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:07,000
perspective on those so categories are

256
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,099
somewhat arbitrary unavoidable I the

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,160
categories aren't completely made up

258
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,050
you'll see him I so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number</font>

259
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,379
of categories which are just given by

260
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,719
law or regulation at least in the US and

261
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,360
many other countries where certain sets

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,339
of things are labeled in a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

263
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be always clear what a</font>

264
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,360
survey is I mean is your bank calling

265
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,360
you but customer service is that wine

266
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,930
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I but there's a relatively well</font>

267
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,569
established set of things that at least

268
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,229
a survey taker<font color="#E5E5E5"> should know whether they</font>

269
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:43,360
fall into that category or not I'm

270
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,880
assuming they don't cheat charities are

271
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">well defined legally at least in most</font>

272
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,529
countries is not for profit designations

273
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,829
and so on political calls are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

274
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined all of that you know and I also</font>

275
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,449
have what turns out that there is a

276
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of these separate third party</font>

277
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,189
apps and this is queendom one of them I

278
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:05,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">owe that do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out to be</font>

279
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:07,420
very similar the categories are not one

280
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,910
hundred percent per same so based on

281
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,120
very specific ones like IRS scam which

282
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,910
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm and if something that come</font>

283
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,550
hopefully comes and disappears I but

284
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,740
they are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly similar if you look at</font>

285
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list you'll see a large overlap in</font>

286
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,559
so that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at least arguably</font>

287
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that matches deployed reality in that</font>

288
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,230
and is some overlap not not a whole lot

289
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,880
with the old ss7 calling party category

290
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,770
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not much</font>

291
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,620
up here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them operator</font>

292
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:43,560
services isn't terribly relevant to what

293
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,910
we're trying to do here um and I

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,579
categories are somewhat guesses so how

295
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,189
do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the category you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

296
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,340
there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get that one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

297
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,640
probabilistic and one is decorated

298
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,980
declarative so if a probabilistic one is

299
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,900
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that we have when you get</font>

300
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,750
a call<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an app on your phone it will</font>

301
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,840
you can basically push a spam button and

302
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,250
if you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can also leave / call</font>

303
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,680
afterwards you can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

304
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,200
address book or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it after I</font>

305
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,620
mean at call time and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to choose</font>

306
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,340
among those type of categories you know

307
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,700
and so you can imagine a scenario where

308
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,770
the likely thing would be in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

309
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,650
minimize and if mislabeling is that you

310
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,240
would for high-volume over callers

311
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,760
you're likely going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots and lots</font>

312
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,730
of reports hundreds thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reports</font>

313
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:45,670
and so if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> number that you just you</font>

314
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,250
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to label as a carrier or is some</font>

315
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,290
third-party entity alone we call path is

316
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,540
almost everybody labels is as a

317
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,670
political call you can be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

318
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,910
that that's what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least what's</font>

319
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:01,390
what people perceive it to be in terms

320
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,329
of if it's kind of some people late<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

321

323
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what then you may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

324
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:16,060
label at all because you're likely going

325
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:19,000
to guess more so that's a more

326
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,819
probabilistic type of mechanism which I

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,709
suspect will work mostly well since the

328
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,438
money isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot of overlap in</font>

329
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,990
some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said you could I say</font>

330
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,730
survey and political intentionally

331
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,790
because there's some dispute from and

332
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,350
push surveys all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the other</font>

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,559
to list it also and slider truck I they

already know that this is a call that

<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that carrier you can I mean a</font>

presumably figure that one out you know

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,620
and a you can basically I my best part

in statutes and everything else involved

361
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:58,629
so least reputable carriers presumably

362
00:18:53,170 --> 00:19:02,830
won't do that next I so the parameters

363

get more into syntax is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

the spam probability which is really

kind of just<font color="#CCCCCC"> abay rough measure of</font>

371
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,559
actually mean it's not like you have to

372
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,290
alternate realities that you flip a coin

373
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,220
for and then heads or tails of lanes or

374
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:32,980
not i but it gives some indication to

375
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,220
extent you care and simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use that</font>

376
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">because email spam indicators seem to do</font>

382
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,740
this is almost definitely spam this is

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,770
unveiled nobody that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten a call a</font>

384
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:02,930
minimal has not reported it as spam or

385
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,270
all the indicators arvest is spam

386
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:09,740
because has some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other might like for</font>

387
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,600
example number is spoof whatever I I so

388
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,400
you can be almost sure this turns into

389
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,300
it and indeed if you haven't seen that

390
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newer versions of Android we may</font>

391
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,620
actually do some version of that so when

392
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,870
you get a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's either your normal</font>

indicator this is a spam call the type

396
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,250
of call I talked at length and then the

397
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,260
reason the source of data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:42,350
this is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> structured one this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

399
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:44,300
simply a indicator as to what I wear how

400
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,330
that was drive for debugging and other

401
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,450
similar purposes so I bought I'm

402
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,820
spamassassin headers which indicate as

403

to which filter triggered up that's most

likely only be useful in the pbx type of

405
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,320

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:20,180

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:24,140

432
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,690
somebody you knew who was in that

433
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:17,930
unfortunate situation I spam call is

434
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,630
everything else and trusted I<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

435
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,760
an entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has like a electric</font>

436
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,000
utility or something that at least as an

437
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,520
entity can be trusted next like that an

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,190
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature capability indicator</font>

439
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,590
that allows you to until we have signing

440
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,710
and this is really an intermediate a

441
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,959
kind of an interim step I so that if you

442
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,350
get one you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure that was</font>

443
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,540
inserted by your local trusted entity

444
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:51,469
otherwise anybody concert' anything and

445
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:53,629
so there is this mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user agent</font>

446
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,120
is supposed to ignore it unless it has

447
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,690
gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set calling for spam indicator</font>

448
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,719
when registering meaning that the local

449
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,120
saqqaq see will insert those and we move

450
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,180
any ones that it did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert one I've</font>

451
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,340
always has reason to trust for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

452
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,530
of media trust relationship that it has

453
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,050
established separately and not so this

454
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,860
is a like I said it should be part of a

455
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,020
passport<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim the future and not right</font>

456
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,770
I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm get I'm not a skald</font>

457
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,750
feature capability experts so if

458
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,889
somebody who does that more frequently

459
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,320
nosy people for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's who I</font>

460
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">label tell me if it's not okay next one</font>

461
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,889
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much it that's it</font>

462
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:43,490
it's that's it so I'm again I I wanted

463
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,160
to get some feedback on both<font color="#CCCCCC"> go wall</font>

464
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,550
approach discussed at some length before

465
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,400
and also in terms of just more mechanics

466
00:23:49,550 --> 00:24:01,550
to see if there's anything I I need to

467
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">change to make it sufficiently useful no</font>

468
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,070
I know I know when this game up in

469
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,680
dispatch there was more than a little

470
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation about the mechanism in</font>

471
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,130
terms of just like is this the way you

472
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,960
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle these sorts of things I'm</font>

473
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:17,090
surprised that we have no microphone

474
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:19,100
line is everyone awake<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the the</font>

475
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">entity person who had the strongest</font>

476
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,600
objection is currently absent so I'm

477
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah John Peterson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if our golf</font>

478
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,689
dispatch all I said was this point about

479
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,570
putting into passport right in the sense

480
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,980
of like having this be a secure

481
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,870
indication having be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign actually seems</font>

482
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,700
kind of important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right in the</font>

483
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,049
sense of this is exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

484
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would if I were spammer</font>

485
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,710
would log be able just get call infos in

486
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,969
there that say the source of this is the

487
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,010
thing you trust and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

488
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,740
then not have to be signed right and so

489
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,270
it's I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows it</font>

490
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">has no value right without signing but</font>

491
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,139
definitely I think having it be

492
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,789
incorporated into passport certainly

493
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,049
tremendously strengthens the value of

494
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the my question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why I put in</font>

495
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,879
this intermediate step for my kind of

496
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,730
the step in previous one we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

497
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,610
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be mu strip it unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

498
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,520
know that it's inserted by the pbx or by

499
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:13,610
your local trusted carrier in that and

500
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:18,110
so to be extend that you minuses at

501
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:20,990
least a consenting adults type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fang</font>

502
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:23,959
we are unless you get a register

503
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,690
response back it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assure mine I</font>

504
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">will protect you against what you said</font>

505
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,610
then you should ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or any and</font>

506
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,590
ignore it anyway because that seems to

507
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,030
again I can't prevent that somebody

508
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:39,340
doesn't do what they claim to do but

509
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:43,158
certainly the idea is that in the pre

510
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:45,530
passport phase which will be a puppy

511
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bitch man that we can at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

512
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,870
use it in the model that the terminating

513
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:53,179
carrier can consult its database and do

514
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,239
its thing and I can be reasonably sure

515
00:25:53,179 --> 00:26:00,350
that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be hoodwinked okay</font>

516
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,900
sugar so it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hanging too quick</font>

517
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:06,620
question first one I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

518
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,350
that so today I I know that we have a Do

519
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,739
Not Call Registry in us right but so I

520
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,449
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that work yeah so we do</font>

521
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,799
not call let me answer it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

522
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,640
on to the next question let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me answer</font>

523
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that question so we do not call registry</font>

524
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,669
was designed at a time when people

525
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:27,350
selling newspapers<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a scourge you</font>

526
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:33,860
might remember those days if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

527
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:35,600
sufficiently age I so we are white works

528
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,240
is you register as a consumer you

529
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,629
register your mobile or your landline

530
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,400
number and

531
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,310
I actually doesn't really mobile you

532
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,620
don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this is was as I said we</font>

533
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,460
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not call is for commercial calls in</font>

534
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,270
general not robo calls specifically I'm

535
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,310
because what were called some mobile

536
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,850
number generally speaking not allowed

537
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:00,340
unless you signed up for them I said so

538
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:05,649
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you register for is your number and</font>

539
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:07,840
a telemarketing company is by law in the

540
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,600
US and I believe it's two in Canada as

541
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:15,459
well is obligated to check the list and

542
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:21,000
not call you I now needless to say if

543
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:25,090
you're committing fraud and extortion

544
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,980
you don't worry about getting a do not

545
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,929
call violation ticket it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

546
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">what said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bank robber doesn't</font>

547
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:35,320
necessarily worry about it but parking

548
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:40,540
meter<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran out I and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but do not</font>

549

call this prevents<font color="#E5E5E5"> called legitimate us</font>

552
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,790
has no effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the people that we're</font>

553
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:58,030
talking about Hugh namely a two

categories evil ones that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal or</font>

close to it and they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font>

556
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">on me we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not call violation our civil</font>

557
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,390
violations and not it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you unfortunately</font>

558
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,340
you can't put jail for making mobile

559
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,090
calls unless you do something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

560
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:17,980
extortion I but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fined FD</font>

561
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">mount I as a civil violation and the</font>

562
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,330
ones which are legitimate cause in the

563
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,270
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not illegal like the survey</font>

564
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:28,270
political charity type of calls but many

565
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">people prefer not to receive you know</font>

566
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:35,230
and so she says is in no way solves the

567
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,490
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not call us would</font>

568
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not call us just doesn't solve a</font>

569
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,290
problem that we have today no I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

570
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,720
because I registered it does not work

571
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:47,920
all the way right so but the next

572
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:52,570
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if this is there then</font>

573
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,100
is it that bonus of the call party to

574
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,799
register accurately

575
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:01,240
to the provider that I am such and such

576
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,100
and then provider will do that at the

577
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,610
station yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's why I said we</font>

578
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:10,480
have it if we get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passport level</font>

579
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:14,649
we will likely see many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the good guys</font>

580
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do want to make cause that could be</font>

581
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:21,940
mistaken for illegal or unwanted calls

582
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:26,229
they will want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to label their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calls so</font>

583
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a recipient what's I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NIH</font>

584
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:32,710
does surveys my community service I for

585
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,010
by phone they have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

586
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,960
because people hate survey takers or

587
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,870
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their scams they don't pick</font>

588
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,480
up a phone they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to know this</font>

589
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a government agency in this case</font>

590
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,530
that's what the prevalent one and so

591
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they increase the chances that</font>

592
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,070
somebody will believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are</font>

593
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually Oh from a government agency as</font>

594
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,330
opposed to somebody who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

595
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">swindle them out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a paycheck I and</font>

596
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,399
Babel label it will get signed at some

597
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,340
point and so initially like I said

598
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,539
earlier is that won't happen it will be

599
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,299
based on data that's available by be

600
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,559
terminating care you or third parties

601
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:14,049
contracted by determining<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kennedy is it</font>

602
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,110
most of us I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

603
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:21,639
fairly booming business of data

604
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:24,428
companies that are used by on primarily

605
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,830
financial institutions to label calls

606
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,919
that are placed to financial institution

607
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:34,240
for fraud prevention so they'd use all

608
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:37,000
kinds of databases I should make to

609
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,620
indicate as to who the caller is as by

610
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,500
name I category I'm a day when<font color="#CCCCCC"> claimed</font>

611
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:47,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be how likely they are fraudulent all</font>

612
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,299
of that so it actually is today and then

613
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:53,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned earlier the</font>

614
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:56,049
human feedback mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I currently</font>

615
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:59,530
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one missing piece that we don't</font>

616
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:01,809
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> have yet is ideally what I showed</font>

617
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,570
under higher feedback you should be able

618
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,610
to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that back with the unwanted</font>

619
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:11,110
response as well I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

620
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:14,439
not yet so the same response categories

621
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,240
would also eventually should flow back I

622
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,340
haven't touched<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet until we get</font>

623
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,900
the other pieces and you're a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

624
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,520
confused maybe the snare on the slide or

625
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,450
is the both feature tag and a feature

626
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,460
capability indicator I'm sorry is it

627
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,380
says it says in the bullet a feature tag

628
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,120
but this title is speech capability

629
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,460
indicator so are these two different

630
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">things or the same thing I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

631
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,740
again this is public title slide says

632
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:44,710
yeah it's a meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a</font>

633
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,929
global future capability yeah and I'm

634
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,059
this is one where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't done this</font>

635
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,360
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a while future tech stuff the</font>

636
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:55,389
idea is it's meant to be in the IANA

637
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,370
global feature tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> a capability registry</font>

638
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,600
unless I yeah not so this doesn't go

639
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,340
you're not talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feature</font>

640
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,918
tagging in the contact header at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

641
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,299
register the response to the register

642
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,640
you're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> any junk in the</font>

643
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,799
future capability hadn't yes yes I mean

644
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,690
if I do take a look do take a look at

645
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,270
the drafts just make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't screw</font>

646
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,730
that up because i copy pasted and

647
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,280
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could well have miss copy</font>

648
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,280
pasted because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm I</font>

649
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,510
couldn't quite admit I had trouble when

650
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,168
I looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registration information</font>

651
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,030
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular registry to know</font>

652
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:32,440
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I was supposed to do it</font>

653
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:34,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of seemed to be going in circles so</font>

654
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,700
if somebody has done with 3gpp type of

655
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,460
stuff is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly took as our 3gpp</font>

656
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,470
style future tags so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a feature</font>

657
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,630
capability indicator in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP poetry I</font>

658
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,090
have a draft it has expired it's

659
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:48,820
actually free GP dependency which tries

660
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:50,709
to populate some of the current media

661
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,240
feature tags as feature capability

662
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,720
indicators so we might want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

663
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,330
little bit great<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to end this isn't</font>

664
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,510
I when housekeeping we should get right

665
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,389
and I'm probably not doing completely

666
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:07,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">white so feature capabilities we do have</font>

667
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:09,640
an expert for doing the reviews all

668
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:14,350
right there I in a registry and that's

669
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:17,760
all because of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i will note extra</font>

670
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,760
make sure that in the note on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

671
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:25,408
Chris I'm be kinda involved in this work

672
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,649
so i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i mean III can do a</font>

673
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,570
review but I mean I'm not yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font>

674
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:32,668
mainly concerned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we registration is</font>

675
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,649
meant just as in vain narrower item I'm

676
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:35,999
just that this is right I just

677
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:38,729
mechanical<font color="#CCCCCC"> light that somebody doesn't</font>

678
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:40,559
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I got in wrong registry and one</font>

679
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,779
label for some one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could don't</font>

680
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,509
quite understand it for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

681
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:49,409
this difference between global and non

682
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:52,549
global and I never quite admit I chased

683
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:57,149
a few drafts and I never quite got a

684
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:59,158
convincing mental model as to which one

685
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,779
it should be which one should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sipping</font>

686
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,570
twitch or should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> at something I mean</font>

687
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:05,940
in seven young as a world thank you so

688
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:08,520
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in over in an intermediate</font>

689
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,020
proxy that's on the par-4 the register

690
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,329
or it's coming from the registrar is

691
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,969
that though yeah so the assumption is it

692
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:19,049
would be the entity you're registering

693
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:22,770
work so this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your an IMS your</font>

694
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:24,960
your local carrier and in a commercial

695
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:28,079
in a enterprise it would be your poxy

696
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,329
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry you a PBX or your sip trunking</font>

697
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,639
provider whatever it happens to be so

698
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:35,329
the assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that's the only</font>

699
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,770
entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any reason to trust I</font>

700
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:43,619
and so we the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you would I</font>

701
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,879
do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says I'm to prevent exactly</font>

702
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,139
what promise I said whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that I</font>

703
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,558
the bad guys will obviously make

704
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,899
themselves look good and I just seems to

705
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">be even I get way aboard at fun but</font>

706
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,190
somebody else has done some version

707
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,839
about I mean the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic idea you</font>

708
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:07,559
ignore it unless somebody tells you that

709
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:11,940
you shouldn't ignore it all right any

710
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:13,859
other comments and i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might think</font>

711
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm pretty well besides this stuff i'm</font>

712
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,839
pretty well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i consider myself pretty</font>

713
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,339
well done so feedback now would be quite

714
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,210
helpful so they can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet our</font>

715
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:27,058
milestone all right yeah so yes feedback

716
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,460
on the feature capability indicator<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

717
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:34,599
sounds any<font color="#CCCCCC"> categories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're missing</font>

718
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:54,599

has been appeared with regard to that it

729
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:34,190
was only to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> dispatch to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sakura due to</font>

730
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:37,999
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff is now ready</font>

731
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:40,999
let's say it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way what does what</font>

732
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:42,980
does a draft described is at least we we

733
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:48,288
have this given<font color="#E5E5E5"> location header field in</font>

734
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:51,319
RFC 642 which could be added<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a</font>

735
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:54,200
sip message a couple of times so so that

736
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,970
we have locations added by different

737
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:05,089
entities including the user equipment

738
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:10,788
and their order of values so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this field</font>

739
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:14,390
will indicate which entity has added the

740
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:18,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">gay location had a field and this is</font>

741
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:19,910
needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow the service at least</font>

742
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is the emergency service for</font>

743
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe to indicate which entity is at</font>

744
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,890
least trustful or which entity is to be

745
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken to use the location so</font>

746
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that'sthat's at least the issue what</font>

747
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:41,720
what's described next hell so who bonds

748
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,319
it yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's etsy there's a project for</font>

749
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:48,379
93 which defines the emergency call for

750
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a issue where</font>

751
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,519
regulators vendors and operators are

752
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:59,359
within and they have put this location

753
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:02,209
header field as a information within

754
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,328
their specification and at least that

755
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:08,749
that's the last bit which is missing

756
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:11,509
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ready for let's say</font>

757
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:12,109
find the proof love their document and

758
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:14,180
now

759
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:17,330
it's missing to have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick element</font>

760
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,299
so next one so so the question is how to

761
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:23,330
proceed now so there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

762
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,480
comments with regard of this document

763
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:29,120
and I've overtaken the word from from

764
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,560
chains to<font color="#CCCCCC"> preceded here an idea further</font>

765
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,900
until we get our sea and i've added all

766
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,740
comments that were appearing and we had

767
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:43,460
a discussion in February with regard so

768
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:47,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have put this into the dispatch draft</font>

769
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:50,630
and since I get a comment from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Khan that</font>

770
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,060
we have but this should be done within

771
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,090
sip core I've changed the naming and and

772
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,940
put it towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zipco group so my</font>

773
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is how to proceed now because</font>

774
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:04,790
from my point of view and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

775
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,670

problem that we dis just discussed I'm

820
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:23,939
talking about it i right but I mean I

821
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:25,229
just seems me oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's</font>

822
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:26,640
the same search that elongation in a

823
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:29,098
gentle kiss the G<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you actually</font>

824
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,058
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know follow this yes URL the</font>

825
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,109
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust what's in their</font>

826
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:32,759
side of it is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust the</font>

827
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:35,069
trust I car that pitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you're right</font>

828
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's like so it's very different</font>

829
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,680
once

830
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,970
you're transposing this to somewhere

831
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,930
where there's some crypto that's telling

832
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,910
you who you're talking to and getting

833
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,740
the info from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just saying this in a</font>

834
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,339
flat head where it's like hey I was a

835
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,930
source of us some yeah i mean honestly

836
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,100
the reason why you should trust this

837
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">rice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you trust what's on the</font>

838
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,870
other side of that URL or if it's in a

839
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,070
CID<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the object net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CID should be</font>

840
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,460
signed or something right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you trust</font>

841
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:02,850
it because you trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sign that so I</font>

842
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I guess that maybe the beg for</font>

843
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,240
the question that gave what what what do

844
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think what what do you do</font>

845
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,339
differently right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that</font>

846
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:14,009
domain name in lock source then you

847
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,470
would do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just dereference</font>

848
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:20,670
that URL and<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cert on the other</font>

849
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of it so if you have different</font>

850
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:26,250
locations within so so we need to

851
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,160
identify which which which element has

852
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:32,450
added it so so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have this</font>

853
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,850
additional header who care so a today

854
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:37,980
yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question the question is which</font>

855
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:41,790
which element is the trustful tournament

856
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:45,270
so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user equipment</font>

857
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,190
or the let's say first proxy with which

858
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,830
is in the trust of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or if it is a</font>

859
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,840
private proxy which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the trust</font>

860
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:55,680
domain so so you have have different

861
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:58,470
let's say layers so it might be attacked

862
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,240
both of us are coming from is way two

863
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,660
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things one is purely for</font>

864
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,990
diagnostic purposes we are you want some

865
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,410
indication as to who is insert or so if

866
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,970
it works wrong you can blame<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

867
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,620
but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a plat model in a</font>

868
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,810
sense you don't have an adversary who's

869
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,880
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fool you but one that we are</font>

870
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:21,540
concerned about as in the previous case

871
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,630
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody wants to spoof their</font>

872
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:27,870
location they can pretty well figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

873
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:30,000
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> locks oyes is going to make you</font>

874
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,710
believe that location even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was</font>

875
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,200
generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use our quick reminder was</font>

876
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,240
generated whatever I they will put in

877
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,689
whatever achieves day on the failures

878
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,750
goals so they have not looked at

879
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,960
security conservation intersection but

880
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:48,470
it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not adding any</font>

881
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,290
security itself unless

882
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:55,730
signing part in which case you've

883
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:59,330
already solved that problem so sorry yes

884
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:01,880
yeah yes yeah so so so so we are looking

885
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the trust of Maine with regard to it</font>

886
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,960
so so so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's done for I'm s for</font>

887
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:11,270
example so that's that's our regulated

888
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,520
environment we have in Europe so with

889
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:17,720
regard to that so if you have spec tea

890
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,340
and you knew that your leader in a

891
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,348
trusted environment what do you do

892
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,940
differently because you see this you

893
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:25,340
then know there was added by trusted

894
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,810
person but that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kyogre ask this</font>

895
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,790
question what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do differently but I</font>

896
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,830
think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can answer I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the premise</font>

897
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,710
in this is it more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing may</font>

898
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:35,930
ants may put stuff in and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

899
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,480
list that's an ordered list at the

900
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,669
consumer and that ordered<font color="#E5E5E5"> list will say</font>

901
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,790
which one they bother to look at they're

902
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:46,550
all trusted but some are some are more

903
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:53,450
preferable to use than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

904
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:55,700
the use case in people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

905
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,348
thinking so you're saying basically each

906
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,270
of them you believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of them</font>

907
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:00,470
it's making you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> an honest best</font>

908
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,060
effort to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> your location but</font>

909
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:08,680
you know that some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

910
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:17,420
it than others basically it saying it

911
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:18,950
yeah John Pearson so so even granting

912
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,339
that then why is the local source

913
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,310
customer or look source carrier instead

914
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a domain name like it so you expected</font>

915
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,619
the people that are interpreting this

916
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,859
you can understand from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a domain name</font>

917
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:33,740
who the entity is that out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this but</font>

918
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that could be dif different</font>

919
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,689
entities including this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

920
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:42,200
HH proxy or transit network so so that

921
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:46,160
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> added the location so so if so</font>

922
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,950
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let me restate that</font>

923
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,379
question why why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that to be</font>

924
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,640
readable like that why is that just not

925
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,830
a vlog you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be comparing</font>

926
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,210
these in the end to a list that you're

927
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:01,490
keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> any anyhow so why isn't just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

928
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,060
string of random bits that also occur in

929
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,529
your list

930
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,680
your answer to that as well it'd be nice

931
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:12,230
if it's readable right for diagnostic

932
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:14,720
person purposes right but the the

933
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:19,850
jumping all the way to a domain name

934
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,040
they're probably takes the analysis of

935
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,870
what you're trying to do you down a hole

936
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,390
that it shouldn't have gone down and may

937
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,370
run into problems for you later now the

938
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that I got up to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mic to start</font>

939
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:39,920
with and I hope this isn't just wasted

940
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:43,070
breath but you you you through inspect e

941
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,350
to the question about security right and

942
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:48,710
if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be the answer then</font>

943
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:51,230
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sit down right if if moving</font>

944
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">past spec t is not is not something to</font>

945
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:57,140
put on the table um if it's just a speck

946
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:02,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">T draft then you know not i'll go back</font>

947
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:03,440
to go back to sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the solution the</font>

948
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,150
thing that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were talking for you</font>

949
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,360
don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that local source thing at</font>

950
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:10,760
all just tie in what your source is to

951
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that URL verify that the URL comes</font>

952
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,630
in with the thing that your lists will

953
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,570
look at will be the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

954
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:19,850
they get back from um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

955
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,320
domain name out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that URL at that</font>

956
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:27,860
point which I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> then gets back to me</font>

957
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:29,990
to John to you know sorry John Peterson

958
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,270
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not decide</font>

959
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,700
what's hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the source is the</font>

960
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:36,410
list presumably you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist your</font>

961
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,379
trust domain what's a what's the listen

962
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,600
it so I mean I can I just I so if you

963
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,810
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it like I want to flag that</font>

964
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,549
this geolocation came from a less<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

965
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:48,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">resolution sources and they have that</font>

966
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:51,200
semantics be<font color="#CCCCCC"> President it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

967
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:53,570
what adding a domain name in this adds

968
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,020
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and yes of course I have nothing</font>

969
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,030
but contempt for using suspect e to make

970
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,980
this seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is actually not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

971
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:04,120
to just be you know arbitrarily

972
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,120
populated by you ever wanna

973
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:13,250
the other concern that I have is Miss

974
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,430
goes to the domain name issue is if

975
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:19,790
you're sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> henning speaking I if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

976
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:21,740
issue is that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that in an</font>

977
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:25,610
inter domain in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tight mr. formain</font>

978
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:28,580
context and primarily the distinction

979
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:32,630
you care about is was it inserted by the

980
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:36,190
user equipment or the carrier or maybe a

981
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:38,720
vocation service of some sort for

982
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">recipient the public safety answering</font>

983
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,060
point or terminating carrier whatever it

984
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,560
happens to be is those labels are

985
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,620
completely meaningless I'm not even sure

986
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:52,640
what if i put my domain name based on my

987
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:55,220
IP address for my phone in there that

988
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,089
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't tell that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

989
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,709
that looks like a hobo or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no way</font>

990
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:04,340
of telling that this was the user

991
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:06,770
equipment unless I'm in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vase aim at</font>

992
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,980
mrs. after<font color="#E5E5E5"> main I know what my naming</font>

993
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:12,440
scheme is all about so if you're trying

994
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:16,300
to functionally label it as opposed to

995
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:19,730
blame my figure out which box to kick

996
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,100
within the same administrative domain it

997
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:26,120
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a functional designation</font>

998
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:29,810
namely this was inserted by use and

999
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,210
equipment by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bakary irvine whatever our</font>

1001
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:38,410
I as always what do I know is it

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,799
no idea and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want you I don't</font>

1004
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,900
want to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you name your boxes</font>

1005
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,910
because you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to change it</font>

1006
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,600
without notifying all your downswing

1007
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,600
carrier partners

1008
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:04,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other comments questions</font>

1009
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:08,349
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well thank you Roland</font>

1010
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:11,739
um I guess you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> given some</font>

1011
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:17,369
feedback to chew on so all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1012
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:17,369
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so next up is 45</font>

1013
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay next slide please okay so the idea</font>

1014
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,090
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is to try to and delegate</font>

1015
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:43,810
the application of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and</font>

1016
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:45,970
authorization to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party entity to</font>

1017
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:48,840
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user later on to register</font>

1018
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:54,220
without the set pay for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP network</font>

1019
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,710
and so the user will use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in on Sept</font>

1020
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,379
credentials do that and later on be able

1021
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:02,230
to register typically this is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1022
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,940
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for single sign-on a top of</font>

1023
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:07,090
feature where the user expected

1024
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically to use some one set of</font>

1025
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:14,670
credentials to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sip and</font>

1026
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:18,850
non-slip services so next slide please

1027
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:22,060
so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft different from</font>

1028
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that previous support raft so the</font>

1029
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:29,580
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth draft was trying to be</font>

1030
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,680
very generic framework for

1031
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:36,549
authenticating authorization and

1032
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:41,200
authorizing sip services so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had very</font>

1033
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">long discussion John iron and another on</font>

1034
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the main less than we killing agree into</font>

1035
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,340
it couldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an agreement on that</font>

1036
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:54,100
so this new draft is a scaled-down

1037
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:56,950
version it's trying to focus on on that

1038
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,770
I only came the user and just allowing

1039
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,830
that user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that user agent later to</font>

1040
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:04,390
just register to the same network so

1041
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:09,220
that's that's that the extent of this

1042
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:11,650
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next like so a defines two</font>

1043
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:15,430
types of clients actually talking about

1044
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:18,610
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> client's and in general in our case</font>

1045
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:21,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client is running on an ass accuser</font>

1046
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:25,390
agent so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of clients</font>

1047
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:31,090
a confidential client which is a client

1048
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:33,430
that in it secures that the credentials

1049
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:35,390
that collects from the user whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

1050
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,720
credentials or tokens

1051
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,819
and a public client which doesn't do

1052
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,950
that for it so typically like the public

1053
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">line just collect that in credentials</font>

1054
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:48,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">and gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the core so we're</font>

1055
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:51,829
gonna see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cases that use</font>

1056
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:56,779
those two types of fake lines next slide

1057
00:53:51,829 --> 00:54:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so that first cases say talk</font>

1058
00:53:56,779 --> 00:54:02,630
about a public user agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 32 I so</font>

1059
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,539
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some you guys have very</font>

1060
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:08,029
limited and user interface in this case

1061
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:11,450
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are a user or a</font>

1062
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:15,410
user agent that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual I so that</font>

1063
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:18,470
the user agent it tries to register get

1064
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:19,970
3d redirected yes so in this case we're

1065
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about 30 to it could be</font>

1066
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:27,740
something else it could it could be 400

1067
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:30,079
is something we can discuss a that the

1068
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,839
user agent then goes to the

1069
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,140
authorization server which is an out of

1070
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the scope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vest draft this is just using</font>

1071
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:43,640
HTA or off mechanism and-a authenticates

1072
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:46,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and gets a code and access code</font>

1073
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:49,400
and then registered without your

1074
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,470
authorization code right that the proxy

1075
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,319
then uses that code to exchange it for

1076
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,839
token and then allow that a registration

1077
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:00,799
complete so that's one users use case

1078
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:03,470
right next slide please this use case

1079
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:06,170
for a public you a with limited you I so

1080
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:09,319
the user interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that user agents</font>

1081
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:12,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">really limited or there is no no screen</font>

1082
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:16,308
at all right but the user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

1083
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:19,519
a browser so he will that user will use

1084
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:22,039
a browser to a connect to the

1085
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:25,399
authorization server authenticate and

1086
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:28,880
get an an access code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our a</font>

1087
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,390
numeric Xcode that it's a is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a limited</font>

1088
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,299
time and and then in the user agent

1089
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:38,779
collect that code from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and send</font>

1090
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:41,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in the registration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1091
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:43,880
proxy exchanges that that code with a

1092
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:48,330
token and allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font>

1093
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:50,190
registration complete next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please</font>

1094
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,920
so in this case we're talking about

1095
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:55,710
confidential you a with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rich you I</font>

1096
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,870
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it directly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes to</font>

1097
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:00,860
the authorization server authenticate

1098
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:04,170
and obtains tokens directly and then

1099
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:07,650
uses those tokens to register with that

1100
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:10,950
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asa proxy so a the register</font>

1101
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:14,300
will have that access token the proxy

1102
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,919
could could the user and an

1103
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,480
introspection step to go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1104
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:26,280
other server and then it complete that

1105
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:28,680
registration next<font color="#CCCCCC"> line okay so you wanna</font>

1106
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:38,640
crystally want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some</font>

1107
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:41,089
ims yeah just quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean we there is</font>

1108
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:45,720
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a use case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this this is</font>

1109
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:48,000
actually needed by by there by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ims</font>

1110
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for for the web RTC access to IMA</font>

1111
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,320
service and this registration is the

1112
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,790
only thing even though when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the</font>

1113
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,860
previous draft this is the only part

1114
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was ever used by by ims so that the</font>

1115
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,570
fact that scaled down do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

1116
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:05,459
affect ims usage we still have what's

1117
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,410
needed so this is just if you have heard

1118
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the terms that I a misuse is they</font>

1119
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,370
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is called Vickie</font>

1120
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:13,320
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> client they have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ww SF which</font>

1121
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:15,540
is a web basically the web server and

1122
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,370
maybe most importantly in this context

1123
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a WAF which is basically the</font>

1124
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,900
authorization service this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1125
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,850
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that issues two tokens this</font>

1126
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,950
could be owned by the MS operator it

1127
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,990
could be a third party like or like

1128
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,640
Facebook or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that the way</font>

1129
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:32,729
oath works in general so next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

1130
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just very simply used</font>

1131
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:38,010
is how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from my ms you have the</font>

1132
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:39,930
vehicle application and I'm dynamics

1133
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,670
user is the resource owner and there's

1134
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:43,410
resources that you know i am a

1135
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:46,320
subscription so so the application wants

1136
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:48,660
to have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today grey</font>

1137
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,030
ims application so it does the

1138
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,040
authorization request gets grant since

1139
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:55,830
its territorial education server gets

1140
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,259
the token and the token is then sent in

1141
00:57:55,830 --> 00:58:00,270
the registration this number five is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1142
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:02,730
zip register request which is sent to

1143
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:08,200
ims network

1144
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:10,330
so yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then of course</font>

1145
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:20,049
there are diam is network Majesty's with

1146
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:22,660
with the ims user credentials so I think

1147
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:25,690
next slide just have a list of open

1148
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:28,720
issues they're probably more things that

1149
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">when i discuss at a we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

1150
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to feedback from this group part hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> john</font>

1151
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">peterson i hate it no it's fine really</font>

1153
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,140
scope of it is sufficiently scaled down

1154
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,240
to this registration case like I said

1155
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,109
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably fun meaning I don't</font>

1164
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:38,940
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is this something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

1165
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:53,080
on as a milestone right now or would be

1166
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">been questioned this has been if the</font>

1167
00:59:53,080 --> 01:00:02,348
working group is interested in taking

1168
00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:05,410
that milestone I don't object okay um

1169
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:09,310
you're doing wrong value most um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1170
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:14,890
um I'd seen seeing who's interested so

1171
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:15,490
um hum if the working group should take

1172
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:21,540
this on

1173
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:23,859
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group item right hum if you</font>

1174
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:26,380
think that this should not be a working

1175
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:36,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">group item that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't work on it</font>

1176
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:40,420
Oh how's the jabber room on both<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1181
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:56,920
dispatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc that was dispatched on</font>

1182
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:00,610
Monday and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> rifat wanted to talk</font>

1183
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:05,260
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digest so um Roland why don't</font>

1184
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:09,790
you come up and talk about the the 850

1185
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:14,170
the murder sorry I've got my notes here

1186

1187
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:20,859
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on Monday I've presented in</font>

1188
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:25,180
dispatch a addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the reason header</font>

1189
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:27,609
which will or should at a location

1190
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,980
parameter which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do with</font>

1191
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:33,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i present it before because</font>

1192
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:35,380
that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q 850 location that is the</font>

1193
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:38,800
location within the PS then I stand

1194
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:41,920
network where a call is released and due

1195
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:44,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we are currently have</font>

1196
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:48,280
hybrid networks where we have PS then

1197
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:50,560
last sip networks in work we have

1198
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,440
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need this kind of</font>

1199
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,259
location with regard for example the

1200
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,070
busy case it's a difference if a user is

1201
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:02,260
busy or if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sand the busy cause</font>

1202
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:04,060
value from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and and there we</font>

1203
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">have different service behavior and</font>

1204
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:09,549
that's described within that draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1205
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:12,549
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to proceed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work here with</font>

1206
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:15,790
in zip core<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm put your slides</font>

1207
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:24,010
from dispatch up so get your a review

1208
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:26,770
the locations and why so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um and I</font>

1209
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:28,570
was you know as an individual you know

1210
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:29,319
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this I thought that this</font>

1211
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,799
seemed to

1212
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:36,930
pretty straightforward and a small small

1213
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:45,099
bit of work so who has read this draft

1214
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:48,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">hmm okay um yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm any</font>

1215
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:56,319
interest in this it taking it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

1216
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:59,529
working group item um okay awesome sound

1217
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:04,989
hum if there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group</font>

1218
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:13,479
item helm if you don't think it should

1219
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:19,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group item hum if I can</font>

1220
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:22,649
have a pony I was just curious is a 3gpp

1221
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:26,589
meeting or an idea anyway yes I'm sure

1222
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:29,559
ya know why I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from the way that</font>

1223
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:31,209
that home was oriented you know again we

1224
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:33,099
can I'm sure we can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to tunnel</font>

1225
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:36,959
everything left in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSF network</font>

1226
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:36,959
you're not yet titling with inset sure i

1227
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:45,420
was expecting this comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

1228
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,420
you

1229
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:55,380
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I should say that we</font>

1230
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:58,500
wouldn't be doing all of this all at

1231
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:06,480
once there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just gauging</font>

1232
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:10,349
interest this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben again i'll come at</font>

1233
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,720
some of the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tiny so yeah</font>

1234
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:14,130
they could be done by just a kind of

1235
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,270
does anyone objected this is it ready

1236
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,890
for working group last call sort of

1237
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing and be through really quick that</font>

1238
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:24,598
doesn't mean they need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way of</font>

1239
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a big workers still okay next slide</font>

1240
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:34,230
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and knows that and if I is</font>

1241
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:38,480
broken so next slide please so I RFC 76

1242
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:41,549
16 it's a that latest HTTP digest so it

1243
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,900
updated that the algorithms that are

1244
01:04:41,549 --> 01:04:50,339
supported with a HTTP a shot of 56 that

1245
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:54,720
the default a 512 to fixes 56 as a

1246
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:57,930
backup and me5 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulled backward</font>

1247
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:01,259
compatibility the changes also requires

1248
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:04,500
the use of GOP a parameter and there is

1249
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:08,849
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono registry for new algorithms</font>

1250
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:12,089
so that's what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an HTTP group</font>

1251
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:14,190
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please so we want to follow</font>

1252
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:16,710
the same recommendations there or just

1253
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:19,680
following the their step just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure</font>

1254
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:22,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">own align that so the draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking</font>

1255
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:26,279
about a using the same algorithms with

1256
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:29,790
the same priority in requiring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> QP</font>

1257
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:34,599
parameter and updating that a sip a BF

1258
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:37,599
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> neck slightly is now</font>

1259
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:40,119
that is that issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sip for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> King and I</font>

1260
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,940
hope that we can get some thoughts from

1261
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:46,119
from this group here it currently that

1262
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:52,089
that in the draft is talking about when

1263
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:54,609
a message is forked a multiple proxies

1264
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:58,869
from multiple downstream service could

1265
01:05:54,609 --> 01:06:01,598
reply and challenge that request and and

1266
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:04,269
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint is expected to kind of</font>

1267
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,089
reply to a multiple of those so wanted

1268
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:10,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your thoughts on but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

1269
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:12,849
sense or do something else so what

1270
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:14,769
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is the subject</font>

1271
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:18,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of the very first draft I wrote</font>

1272
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay got rolled into 3261</font>

1273
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:24,700
okay to change that behavior you're

1274
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:27,488
talking about opening up 3261 in

1275
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:31,058
redefining the way proxies deal with

1276
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:34,269
aggregating responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um is this</font>

1277
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:37,720
needed that's a question systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1278
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:39,700
were designed that expected this um the

1279
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,799
expected this behavior out of proxies

1280
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,538
it's what's currently defined how big

1281
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:45,910
those deployments are at this point I

1282
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:49,119
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is what the specs says</font>

1283
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:52,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the answer to</font>

1284
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,400
is this needed is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the scope of the</font>

1285
01:06:52,119 --> 01:07:01,799
problem that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for is</font>

1286
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,799
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up 3261 and redefine proxies ok ok</font>

1287
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:09,788
ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's use what would a man my</font>

1288
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:20,489
strong suggestion to you is leave it

1289
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:20,489
alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay okay any other thoughts</font>

1290
01:07:25,289 --> 01:07:35,380
commenting on the previous slide just be

1291
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:37,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did this is just to think it probably</font>

1292
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:41,769
is right but we should just make sure i

1293
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:43,450
know that when stunned /<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn long-term</font>

1294
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:48,279
credentials were designed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1295
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:51,100
use the same databases it says a sip

1296
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,700
turn this<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I guess the second son this</font>

1297
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:56,049
is defining how to use the something

1298
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically HTTP digest so we should make</font>

1299
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:01,780
sure that those are aligned it can still

1300
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:02,859
use the same password databases so just

1301
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:05,320
just the thing that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

1302
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,940
looked at and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and check the two drafts</font>

1303
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:10,510
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> either the more wrong figure out</font>

1304
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:14,800
which one to fix so you saying the stun

1305
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:18,930
draft is using the edge to meet using

1306
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:21,220
granted<font color="#E5E5E5"> right given that we wanted to</font>

1307
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:22,089
there was a design goal originally that

1308
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">they could share the same password</font>

1309
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:25,600
databases we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that as</font>

1310
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:27,880
they both move to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do sex that's</font>

1311
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,260
still true I see so just review it

1312
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,359
probably some you know you should review

1313
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:37,359
the Sun<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk draft and make sure that's</font>

1314
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:40,960
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> krista</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with what</font>

1315
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,339
Robert said but what I don't understand

1316
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,420
it what what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually that you</font>

1317
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:50,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to achieve no so so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1318
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,589
was regarding forking right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1319
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:57,189
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that is needed in the first</font>

1320
01:08:53,589 --> 01:09:00,189
place or the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of a Penta</font>

1321
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:02,649
gating multiple downstream servers can

1322
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:05,559
be simplified somehow and not requiring

1323
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:08,108
that that proxy to aggregate that

1324
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:12,850
challenges back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the client and the</font>

1325
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:19,900
client to reply to all of those right go

1326
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:21,819
ahead so I it again so you are happy if

1327
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:22,960
the client does not have to reply to all

1328
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:25,210
of those changes that's what you're

1329
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,310
saying or you know the question is is

1330
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:32,770
that is that needed is there a use case

1331
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:35,950
that would require em with a multiple

1332
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:39,490
end or downstream proxes will will

1333
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:42,660
challenge a request and then then<font color="#CCCCCC"> put is</font>

1334
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:46,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer ok</font>

1335
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:49,299
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking for a reuse case</font>

1336
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:53,130
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok does that</font>

1337
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:56,400
make sense Mike

1338
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:58,050
sure show and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Makoto compass yeah John</font>

1339
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,849
peers man I'd look at this text like

1340
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:02,460
forever i think i wrote this text back

1341
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:05,760
in thirty to sixty one but I know it's

1342
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,699
cute yeah sku up actually optional then

1343
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,739
I mean tomorrow with them if you're

1344
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:13,830
using md5 I think you have to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1345
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:15,900
out and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty to sixty one</font>

1346
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:17,309
is that is not it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sure text</font>

1347
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,409
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it says that any</font>

1348
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:22,230
algorithms have dependency on SI NOS

1349
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:24,960
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive require the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correct if</font>

1350
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:27,120
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> set ok so it's impossible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use so</font>

1351
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,699
again it says for backwards compatible

1352
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,580
compatibility reasons with our see what

1353
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:36,870
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2617 that technically the pro</font>

1354
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:38,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay but I mean it says if</font>

1355
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,840
you if you have to use C nonce you have

1356
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,849
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cue up okay so there's actually</font>

1357
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,620
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> k since it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we don't use provides</font>

1358
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:46,170
to say there you sure q office children

1359
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:48,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya i have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem obviously</font>

1360
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:50,070
with a draft that sensibly recommends

1361
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:52,380
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use any five anymore</font>

1362
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:54,480
infestans if we use chacha Fugees x so

1363
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,190
again this is something where I think we

1364
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,049
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that narrow thing</font>

1365
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,909
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us would be up here you happened</font>

1366
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,409
about this right so let's do that narrow

1367
01:10:59,909 --> 01:11:03,480
thing and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to look at</font>

1368
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:05,909
reopening proxy server behavior let's do

1369
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another draft no no I was hoping</font>

1370
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:10,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do that I just</font>

1371
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:17,580
want was looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any use case that</font>

1372
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:20,190
really needs this otherwise ok something

1373
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:25,880
that's it i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got not answer all</font>

1374
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:29,669
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um anybody have anything else</font>

1375
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:36,300
um blue sheets<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody slaying the</font>

1376
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:39,320
blue sheets right no I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1377
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,320

01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:16,790
conference
