publication of this initial version of

111
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,630
the draft there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of feedback</font>

112
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,250
received which led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publication of</font>

document is dash 0 2 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

118
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,490
presenting today and this version mostly

119
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,770
addresses the comments kindly provided

120
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:46,530
by Michael explicit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first of all</font>

121
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:50,040
let's take a quick look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

122
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:52,140
motivation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft so today we</font>

123
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,329
have that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several application</font>

124
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,050
layer protocols that are being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

125
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:00,840
several Internet of Things scenarios so

126
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,719
we have constrained application<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

127
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:07,650
co-op which was originally designed /

128
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,750
UDP however there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-op about TCP</font>

129
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,640
specification in progress the main

130
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason being the need to overcome</font>

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,120
problems with middle boxes which are not

132
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,959
so friendly sometimes to UDP traffic so

133
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,780
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is being used in this case</font>

134
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,630
then we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and even</font>

135
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTP one that one have been used for are</font>

136
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:33,720
being considered for several<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font>

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,110
scenarios so TCP is used here<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,240
sorry is anybody following<font color="#CCCCCC"> jab</font>

139
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm taking the notes but I hope someone</font>

140
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:54,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">is following jabber so who is willing to</font>

141
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:57,300
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java this one okay then we have</font>

142
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,000
further application layer protocols such

143
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,670
as XMPP which are sometimes used also in

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,490
IOT scenarios then exempli also relies

145
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,979
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP at the transport layer and we</font>

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,690
also have non IDF application layer

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:15,269
protocol such as MQTT which also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

148
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:18,149
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conclusion here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is</font>

150
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:24,570

neglected for IOT scenarios at least

152
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,850
here in the ITF so the purpose of this

153
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is to offer simple measures for</font>

158
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,890
first of all the intended status of the

159
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,660
document is now informational actually

160
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,779
this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been agreed</font>

161
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,329
earlier however the change has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

162
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,939
plate right now so it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

163
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,329
purpose of the document is to report to

164
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,029
explain how TCP can be configured in a

165
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:10,140
suitable way for the scenarios we are

166
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,850
considering then one section of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

167
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,560
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been updated is</font>

168
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,720
section 2 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> entitled</font>

characteristics of CNN's relevant

170
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,449
participe here we have added the

171
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:24,060
explicit definition of constraint load

172
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,750
networks this is literally taken from

173
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,349
RFC 7228 and the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for this is</font>

174
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,709
the fact that a reader might have the

175
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,690
question the doubt about whether the

176
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:40,439
guidance in this document applies only

177
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,570
to 6lowpan or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> low networks or which</font>

178
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,120
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the scope so the scope of</font>

179
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">these guidance is any network which</font>

180
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,590
conforms to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of constraint</font>

181
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,900

182
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:56,960
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another section we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> updated is</font>

183
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:00,140
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the TCP maximum segment</font>

184
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,540
size so in previous versions of the

185
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,630
document there was there were some

186
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,680
recommendations about the fact that some

187
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:12,080
6lowpan or six low links define an MTU

188
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,589
of twelve hundred and eighty bytes and

189
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,710
then the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid IP layer</font>

190
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,140
fragmentation the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP MSS has to be set</font>

191
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:25,790
accordingly for example avoiding to

192
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,590
exceed 120 bytes however we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have added</font>

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,189
in this version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document that</font>

196
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,610
constraint mode network space such as

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:44,930
for instance m stp able to dot 11 eh or

199
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:52,060
greater and views so in this case the

200
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP MSS may be set to greater values</font>

201
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,430
without incurring IP layer fragmentation

202
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:03,620
although of course we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be careful</font>

203
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:08,979
to adjust correctly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP MSS to the</font>

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,580
another section we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> updated</font>

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,189
discusses the window size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP so in</font>

207
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:23,390
previous versions of the document we

208
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,760
were actually stating or recommending

209
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,080
use of a single MSS window as a way to

210
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,540
reduce complexity of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation</font>

211
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,910
however we have modified the the

212
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,449
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the writing of this and now</font>

213
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,870
what we say is we just explained that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

214
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">t-statistic can reduce implementation</font>

215
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:49,460
complexity by advertising at is a window

216
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:52,340
size of single MSS and can also use a

217
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,040
transmit the window<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of a single MSS</font>

218
00:14:52,340 --> 00:15:00,170
and we explain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

219
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">then this reduces complexity but also it</font>

220
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,229
reduces performance in some aspects such

221
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,540
as through

222
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,250
for instance so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:13,670
recommendation now we have this

224
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:15,950
explanation next please another section

225
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,670
that has been updated is the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

226
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,800
RTO estimation so we have added<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

227
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,550
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the fact that if a</font>

228
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,229
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp window size is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used then there</font>

229
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,410
will be mechanisms such as fast

230
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,270
retransmit fast recovery or selective

231
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,420
acknowledgments which<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe cannot be</font>

232
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:38,300
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that means that the RTO</font>

233
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,400
algorithm will probably have a larger

234
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,490
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on performance than otherwise and</font>

235
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,870
that's because retries will be actually

236
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">triggered by expiration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the RTO this</font>

237
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:55,070
also opens the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door to adapting or</font>

238
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:58,189
tuning the the RTO algorithm however

239
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,620
this has to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> carefully because</font>

240
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,410
there exists some fundamental trade-off

241
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,410
behind the RTO which is that an

242
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:09,770
aggressive RTO behavior reduces the wait

243
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,199
times before retrace however it also

244
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,689
increases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> probability of incurring</font>

245
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:20,150
serious timeouts so this might lead to

246
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,450
unnecessarily wasting scarce resources

247
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,340
such as energy or bandwidth which is

248
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:31,460
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take care</font>

249
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:35,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">about next please so still in the same</font>

250
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:38,780
section about RTO estimation we still

251
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:41,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked briefly about the Coco RTO</font>

252
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:46,850
algorithm however we do it now as a

253
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:49,730
related note so Coco RTO is the advanced

254
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,650
RTO algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's being defined in</font>

255
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,800
the core working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co-op</font>

256
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:59,990
protocol that's defined for operation of

257
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:03,640
a UDP so the text here is now just as a

258
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:07,670
related note for informational purposes

259
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:11,599
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably still beneficial</font>

260
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,660
for a reader to find that this algorithm

261
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,179
has been evaluated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and compared actually</font>

262
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,850
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP RTO algorithm</font>

263
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:23,480
and also some state-of-the-art<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP based</font>

264
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:26,240
RTO variants and because Coco has been

265
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,240
specifically designed for IOT scenarios

266
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,190
it appears to<font color="#E5E5E5"> outperform these other</font>

267
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,350
algorithms then another section that has

268
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:40,970
been updated is the one about<font color="#E5E5E5"> delayed</font>

269
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:43,669
acknowledgments so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font>

270
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,830
without making particular assumptions

271
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,040
about whether some scenarios are more

272
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,600
common or not than others we<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained</font>

273
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the late acknowledgments are not</font>

274
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended for scenarios with mostly</font>

275
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,300
transactional type of traffic with

276
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:02,150
transaction size of at most<font color="#CCCCCC"> one MSS</font>

277
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,940
that's because the later knowledge means

278
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,970
would just contribute delay here there

279
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,830
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no benefit and on the other</font>

280
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,020
hand delay that knowledge months could

281
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:15,110
be useful to reduce the number of

282
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,110
acknowledgments<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent if an appropriate</font>

283
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:22,429
window size is used in scenarios with

284
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:25,189
bulk transfers so this could be positive

285
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,940
to save resources such as energy in

286
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:32,900
bandwidth in<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint not networks so</font>

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes has been to remove</font>

288
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,210
any particular assumption about whether

289
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:41,390
these scenarios or the scenarios are

290
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:46,670
more common than<font color="#E5E5E5"> others or not next</font>

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,820
are TCP options that improve security

294
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,670
such as for instance and the five

295
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,030
signature option or TCP authentication

296
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,700
options the city ayo however security

297
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,639
comes at the cost of increased overhead

298
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,970
and complexity so we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of</font>

299
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:15,890
this and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example md5 adds 18 bytes</font>

300
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:20,480
or TCP<font color="#CCCCCC"> segments and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TC dao typically has</font>

301
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:23,090
a size of 16 to 20 bytes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

302
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,970
something relevant in the scope of

303
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,770
devices which are energy limited because

304
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,540
every additional bite that we are

305
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,740
transmitting or receiving is going to

306
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,420
consume

307
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:41,780
possibly a significant amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

308
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:44,710
next please so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the document has</font>

309
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,860
an annex which has the purpose of

310
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:52,610
reporting the main characteristics of

311
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:55,669
lightweight<font color="#CCCCCC"> icity implementations and we</font>

312
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,740
have added in this version this table

313
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,780
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see in the slide which</font>

315

progress but you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

316
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,700
purpose is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow some quick</font>

317
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,830
identification of each other futures

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,190
supported or not by different

319
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,850
lightweight tcp implementations and also

320
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:20,290
they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to collect requirements</font>

321
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:24,500
in terms of memory for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

322
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:28,070
implementation as you can see also the

sections about riot and open<font color="#E5E5E5"> wsn are</font>

make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call to the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group so that</font>

these specific specific implementations

328
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,170
or maybe someone considers that the

329
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,660
table should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be expanded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with additional</font>

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:10,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft you have mentioned even the</font>

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP fast of open option and so my</font>

336
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,160
question is are you even considering

337
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,990
scope of all the different options I

338
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,150
mean all the different options which<font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font>

339
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,650
city supports as part of this draft and

340
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,830
check whether it is applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

341
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,450
Winston networks like for example kcp

342
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,340
fast open is mentioned so but there are

343
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,350
a lot of other variants that can also be

344
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,300
that are also applicable and along with

345
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">those applicability comes security</font>

346
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,100
considerations as well so I going to

347
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:41,439
also take care of those points<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

348
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">room not sure if I understood correctly</font>

349
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,770
what you mean so for example we

350
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fo as a way to solve the</font>

351
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:54,190
problem that you may have little boxes

352
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:58,360
in the end to end communication so the

353
00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:02,560
idea is ok to<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe the options of</font>

354
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP that can be relevant because someone</font>

355
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,330
will have to implement icity in a

356
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightweight in a constraint device so</font>

357
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:13,000
there are several options in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP so the</font>

358
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea would be to report the the main</font>

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,960
ways how the TCP implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

360
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,320
configured in a suitable way for some

361
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,490
specific scenario which comprises the

362
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,379
characteristics of a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> device</font>

363
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,900
characteristics may be off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

364
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">network requirement from the application</font>

365
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,760
so they would be to collect the most

366
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:39,610
relevant information<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

367
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:42,610
main options so so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to TCP</font>

368
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">pasco open option let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

369
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,409
specifically so what what is the draft

370
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,430
considering here are we trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

371
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast option as token option</font>

372
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,730
might be more relevant towards

373
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,700
constrained networks because sort of

374
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,910
sense the data along with the so what

375
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:03,990
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we trying to conclude there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

376
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:06,490
well so the document is informational so

377
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,580
we are not kind of mandating anything

378
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,410
that's a first thing to consider so the

379
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,139
purpose is to explain that away

380
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,520
to avoid having to establish a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

381
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,080
connection every time the sensor is

382
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,650
sending some data is to use TFO so you

383
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,120
embed data within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same packet so</font>

384
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,980
that's a way to to avoid this and to

385
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,580
avoid the problem with the middle box

386
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,400
that you might have in between but once

387
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,460
we specify the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP vast open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like option</font>

388
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,920
then again the security considerations

389
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,660
which are naturally you know you are

390
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,370
inheriting the security complications as

391
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,460
well those also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be specified</font>

392
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly here so that would just be as an</font>

393
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,730
input<font color="#CCCCCC"> from myself yeah so there's one</font>

394
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,739
one aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the TFO requires</font>

395
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,210
some cookie which has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be updated for</font>

396
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,420
instance and yeah we might add some

397
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:09,050
details about the refresh rate of that

398
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,390
cookie for example so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

399
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same Center uh could you go back to</font>

400
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous life I think carry us</font>

401
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,160
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so unless you want on let's</font>

402
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the point I let get it off it's</font>

403
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,240
it's it just related<font color="#CCCCCC"> what but wait so</font>

404
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,710
could you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

405
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,870
yeah so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do security you need</font>

406
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,970
more bites but what's the guidance here

407
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,620
like should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do this or should the</font>

408
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,650
guidance be that you should anyways have

409
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,500
pls or object security or<font color="#CCCCCC"> scope on top</font>

410
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,080
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doesn't make sense to do</font>

411
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at this layer I I think the point</font>

412
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,040
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guidance document should be that</font>

413
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,450
there are these options you don't need

414
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them because you should have security</font>

415
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,440
anyways above but just the fact that

416
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,360
saying oh if you do this you you send

417
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,890
more bites on the network I don't think

418
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that like helps me as I think the vendor</font>

419
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,240
well thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the suggestion so I</font>

420
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if you can provide input on this</font>

421
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,510
we will really welcome it and yes so the

422
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea is to explain okay which are the</font>

423
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,940
different options available<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

424
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:19,310
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can provide</font>

425
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,620
options about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you use something</font>

426
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">else maybe it's better make it reduces</font>

427
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,620
the per head then that's of course

428
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,690
beneficial

429
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,949
so one thing I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add more it like</font>

430
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,570
to that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a working</font>

431
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,160
group document it right so like once it

432
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,330
becomes a document then it's up to the

433
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group like it's not out to</font>

434
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,470
Carlos anymore I'd like really to to see

435
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,590
if the there's guidance neither or not I

436
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:45,170
then decides it's going to go on that's

437
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:47,689
how I see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> character Carolyn so Carlos</font>

438
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this work I think</font>

439
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,410
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be important over time I</font>

440
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,750
was the author of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms2 p draft that</font>

441
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,410
you referenced earlier that has the MTU

442
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,960
of 1500 octets um I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out pretty</font>

443
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">late in the game that and Eric can</font>

444
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,640
correct me if I'm wrong but if a node

445
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,939
supports more than twelve eighty then it

446
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,440
must be able to do path MTU so i would

447
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,880
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know in your document</font>

448
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,620
you should probably provide guidance

449
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,010
that unless your application really has

450
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,540
a strong reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have you know mt use</font>

451
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,300
longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1280 you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

452
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,190
stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that assumption because it</font>

453
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,530
wouldn't be for example to say here's

454
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,170
you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making a lightweight</font>

455
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,149
implementation of tcp but it just pushes

456
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:37,670
you know the complexity somewhere else

457
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:39,800
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay thank you I Robbie Simpson</font>

458
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,350
so first off thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so glad to</font>

459
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:46,940
see work on tcp on constrained networks

460
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:49,399
um so uh have you considered adding

461
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,950
anything about actual congestion control

462
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,290
algorithms right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know most of the</font>

463
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,179
world probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks at new New Reno and</font>

464
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,490
stuff like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

465
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,170
intricacies when it comes to pinterest

466
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,090
and control algorithms and potential

467
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,309
guidance we could give for constrained

468
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,689
networks and their stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> even out there</font>

469
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:10,490
that might be more applicable to

470
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,940
wireless etc etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer would be</font>

471
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:16,429
that not yet so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this moment we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

472
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,960
mainly been considering a quite binary

473
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:22,429
approach like male influence because

474
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,120
they had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many claims about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

475
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">even complex and so on that okay we said</font>

476
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,000
well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use a single MSS</font>

477
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,820
window that reduces<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity and that</font>

478
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,250
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some impact on some mechanisms that</font>

479
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,129
will know it will not have any effect

480
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:43,780
so when we consider a window size

481
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:46,430
greater than one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and SS then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

482
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,649
effects may come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> play so i think</font>

483
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:55,790
it's it's relevant also to take a look

484
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">at those yes thank you know my name is</font>

485
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">michael sharpen speaking as gtpm</font>

486
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,210
co-chairs of thanks a lot for this work

487
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting really useful</font>

488
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,900
the TZ p.m. quad chair I think it's

489
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,840
appropriate to this being informational

490
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,120
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is move in the right</font>

491
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,429
direction and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remind the</font>

492
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,919
working group I mean if you want changes

493
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,900
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP then please come to TC p.m. so we</font>

494
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,640
own the protocol but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

495
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,070
welcome informational guidance in other

496
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,660
community so that might be deciding is

497
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,550
adding in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right direction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can also</font>

498
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,800
confirm that quite a bit of my comments

499
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been addressed so I think this is</font>

500
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving in a good direction thanks</font>

501
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,580
a lot Michael an aside minutes right so

502
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,139
like at the last meeting so I took an

503
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,030
action item on myself to talk to the

504
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,220
transfer they need to find like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

505
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,020
co-author for this and and thanks to

506
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,850
Michael for a drink to help like Alice

507
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,830
out like the dis document so Michael

508
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be joining as a quarter and help</font>

509
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:51,260
out on the template pieces of it thanks

510
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,200
Eric not burnt so yeah in addition to

511
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,480
confirming the empty you thing right if

512
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,190
you send about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1280 you have to be</font>

513
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,260
prepared to depart MP discovery and and

514
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,350
if you want to go down that path I don't

515
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,580
know if you want it but but whether one

516
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,969
should then recommend to the

517
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:13,189
packetization MTU discovery in TCP as

518
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,560
opposed to relying on the good old you

519
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">know ICP packet the big messages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

520
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so you in getting into</font>

521
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:24,200
anyone Eddie one in 48 21 whatever the

522
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,160
number is title is packetization layer

523
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,980
and do you discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly so that I</font>

524
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">think would be good to pick a direction</font>

525
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:38,390
in that space but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one that</font>

526
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:40,010
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of surprised me was this the there</font>

527
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,930
seems to be an implicit assumption that

528
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you're talking to is following</font>

529
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,580
the same implementation guidelines when

530
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,730
it comes to sending with a single packet

531
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,990
right having a window of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single packet</font>

532
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,429
only make sense if you

533
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,400
the part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your target it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

534
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:58,120
any delay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dax and by default TCP</font>

535
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,650
implementation do delayed outs so there

536
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,939
seems to be a strong assumption here

537
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:07,460
that your peer is doing our wig as well

538
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:11,059
because otherwise your your your maximum

539
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,100
packet rate is one packet every delay

540
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,950
doc primer which could be five packets a

541
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,020
second right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not very</font>

542
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,550
impressive you don't for a constraint

543
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:25,100
device so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> double</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

544
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:30,260
maybe but i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the latex</font>

545
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">parachute so what up it's not about what</font>

546
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you implement this what you appear</font>

547
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:38,630
implement and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control that</font>

548
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:40,210
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then i have to write both ends</font>

549
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,830
are not implementing the same thing

550
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,870
they're both implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP but</font>

551
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:49,189
there's a wide range of allowed

552
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,840
behaviors in TCP and enhances and most

553
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,730
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pier talking they will be</font>

554
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,178
implementing not implementing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> L</font>

555
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:58,580
vague recommendations but implementing

556
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,820
standard tcp with<font color="#CCCCCC"> delayed eyes so I</font>

557
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,809
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep if you only care about</font>

558
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:09,710
sending a packet a TCP packet once a day

559
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:12,740
the the 1 1 packet offer or outstanding

560
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,290
packet is ok if you want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

561
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,750
packets a second you have to have more

562
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,520
than one right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because otherwise you're</font>

563
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,410
not going to get an interpreter and I

564
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,710
think making that more clear I think

565
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good yeah so we will take</font>

566
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this into consideration thank you yeah</font>

567
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,080
thanks

568
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:40,199
yeah so this actually last slide so

569
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:42,268
considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the document is at</font>

570
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,580
least that the structure is starting to

571
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:48,719
become stable and even the content

572
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:51,389
itself so the authors of the document we

573
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:53,339
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask to the working group</font>

574
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:55,379
whether you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a good</font>

575
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:59,129
moment to adopt the document as a

576
00:31:55,379 --> 00:32:00,689
working group document so then if you're

577
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:02,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">listening like what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

578
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,659
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the car hum now and then go</font>

579
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:12,449
on the list i just take down the list

580
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:15,179
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm i'm here so i think it's a based</font>

581
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:18,589
on the feedback from the audience since

582
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:22,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">berline i think it's a good time to ask</font>

583
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:25,559
appealing love Lisa to or some

584
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:28,649
confirmation but what one one thing is

585
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:31,529
important that as a michael has says

586
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:34,738
speak over the microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> isa if you</font>

587
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:38,570
have some PCP and horses also joining

588
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:41,279
work so that we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

589
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:47,879
recommendations in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

590
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:49,859
direction yeah um Michael is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

591
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:53,399
help out right like so to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure like</font>

592
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:55,349
it's it doesn't like completely go far

593
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,619
away from tcp right like 20 CP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

594
00:32:55,349 --> 00:33:00,059
think so that taken care of it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

595
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,589
like procedural thing do you want to do

596
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,779
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> now or just on the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was my</font>

597
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:05,519
question ready but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a hum</font>

598
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,629
first and then come from a list or do

599
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,309
you want to just go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and do</font>

600
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:13,889
it after I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

601
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:17,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay look yeah could you help Henry</font>

602
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:21,718
because I I cannot see the right now

603
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:26,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll do it okay so um how many</font>

604
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:31,609
people are read this draft oh do you

605
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:31,609
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

606
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,440
I think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough people in the</font>

607
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,240
room to make this call but will take

608
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,820
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list so I try to take a look at</font>

609
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:48,140
this draft and we'll set an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eruption</font>

610
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:48,139
column the list thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's fine</font>

611
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,450
ok now let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the second</font>

612
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,080
hello everyone I'm Rahul jadhav and the

613
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,029
talk is about the presentation is about

614
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:17,060
neighbor management policies for 6lowpan

615
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:18,679
networks I think this slide is not the

616
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,429
latest one I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the slide</font>

617
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:33,859
that I said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the slide from IT of</font>

618
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:38,839
97 hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> chan yeah maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

619
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:52,129
resend the flash to me roll a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dice I</font>

620
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:54,560

yeah yeah so

624
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,220
so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are following remotely</font>

625
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,100
so there's no duration of the slide that

626
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,040
was uploaded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting materials so</font>

627
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,140
the author is mailing new slides and

628
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,220
then we'll upload them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hold on</font>

629
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

630
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:32,380
then can you replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide in the</font>

631
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:41,890
meeting materials of anyone that you

632
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:45,460
just got yes I send out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene so Jim</font>

633
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:48,240
could you open your mail box and see you

634
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,240
got the sly

635
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,170
there

636
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,339
okay well I think you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font>

637
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,750
and I was like okay can<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can you do</font>

638
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah go ahead as a slice</font>

639
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,690
because the people remote are not going

640
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,690
to be able to see if I so

641
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:01,569
hey guys sorry for the people who follow

642
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,249
remotely like it there's been some

643
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:07,329
miscommunication between the press enter

644
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:10,589
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair so we'll make sure it gets</font>

645
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:10,589
uploaded right of the meeting

646
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:43,509
any chance anyone knows how to change

647
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:43,510
this into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> projector</font>

648
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:59,690
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh just ridiculous</font>

649
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,919
what of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

650
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:32,680
yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and sorry everyone for the</font>

651
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,680
delay

652
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:47,970
so this work was presented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> i.t of 97</font>

653
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,830
in Seoul and the the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font>

654
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:54,629
neighbor management policies in 6lowpan

655
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:57,600
networks so in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> row during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

656
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,160
last talked there was no draft so we try

657
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,990
to check yet a general feedback from the

658
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,520
working group whether it makes sense to

659
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,819
work on this problem statement and we

660
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:10,620
got an enormous response post which we

661
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:18,660
have a draft now a working truck we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

662
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:20,839
an individual submission here so yeah

663
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you get it to full screen and then</font>

664
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:40,110
ctrl L sorry sir so what has changed

665
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">since then so first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the last</font>

666
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,640
presentation what we had done was we had

667
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,070
presented a policy a neighbor management

668
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,680
policy and what has changed since then

669
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is apart from the policy the signaling</font>

670
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,759
considerations the signaling

671
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,410
recommendations as to how to bring this

672
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,860
policy into effect is been taken care of

673
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:00,990
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me begin some of the slides I'm</font>

674
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,640
going to repeat here the neighbor

675
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,609
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> why neighbor management is</font>

676
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,930
required so in case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6lowpan networks</font>

677
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:11,910
it is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to anticipate the</font>

678
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:15,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">maximum density of the nodes in a given</font>

679
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network so how much of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tablespace do</font>

680
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">you allocate for the neighbor cache so</font>

681
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,920
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary question that has</font>

682
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,840
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> so whatever take cash sighs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

683
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,740
allocate at some point of time if the

684
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:31,230
density is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high it's going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

685
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:34,350
it's going to overflow so in that case

686
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,880
how are you going to handle the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

687
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:39,210
the entries are you going to retain in

688
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,300
that neighbor cash now prioritization

689
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,630
based on the link quality estimation

690
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,270
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in some cases you</font>

691
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:51,120
might have to retain the cache entries

692
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:54,480
which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more relevant for example it</font>

693
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,810
might not be advisable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evict and</font>

694
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,360
enter

695
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,790
based on the direct child a routing

696
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,340
child so because what happens is<font color="#CCCCCC"> he it</font>

697
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:04,080
it has a ripple<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect ripple effect in</font>

698
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:07,410
terms of all the grand child's are also

699
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,410
evicted so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

700
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:15,000
implications in terms of which entries

701
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:16,259
you can awake from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table so there</font>

702
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some trivial neighbor management</font>

703
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,790
policies one of them is al are you

704
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">another of it is fcfs first-come</font>

705
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">first-serve basis both of them have</font>

706
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:29,779
significant disadvantages and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

707
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,890
these algorithms will scale

708
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,330
unfortunately these are the algorithms

709
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,710
that are currently implemented in most

710
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:39,150
of the open sources expectation takes

711
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,130
the final expectation of this neighbor

712
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,500
management policy is that it should

713
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,450
result in a stable network so when I say

714
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,930
stable<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the routing adjacencies</font>

715
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,669
should not change periodically I mean it

716
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,259
without without such a neighbor

717
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,620
management policy you will have a lot of

718
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,630
churn with<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the neighbors and you</font>

719
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:01,950
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever get a stable routing</font>

720
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:03,990
adjacencies another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is once the</font>

721
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,549
neighbor is accepted it has to be

722
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,339

resources are present to serve that

00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:15,450
neighbor so so a one of so in the

725
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,759
adjoining diagram if you see there what

726
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,770
is mentioned is there is a verily hope

<font color="#E5E5E5">consideration while while while while</font>

732
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,009
putting up a general<font color="#CCCCCC"> guideline says this</font>

733
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">guidelines should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be protocol agnostic</font>

734
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,660
as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible we didn't consider</font>

735
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">ripple specifically or any key</font>

736
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,370
management protocol specifically but we

737
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,500
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some example so we as an</font>

738
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:51,450

<font color="#E5E5E5">its mode of operations and pana as a cue</font>

740
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,569
are the key management protocol next

00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide please</font>

742
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,920
so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered a holistic</font>

743
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,080
approach towards neighbor management

744
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,850
when I say holistic apart from the

745
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,369
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol we also consider the</font>

746
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:12,069
the key management the initial key

747
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:13,420
handshake procedure now that has serious

748
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,609
implications on the neighbor cash

749
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:19,450
management so that is why it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be</font>

different network management when it

757
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,700
comes to our appeal what are the

758
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:41,170
different options available how to serve

759
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,740
the different mode of operations for

760
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,359
ripple so now what are the cases in

761
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,569
which the neighbor table update happens

762
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,119
so first cases during initial key

763
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:54,490
authentication the relay element has to

764
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,140
be selected now there is a relay element

765
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,290
discovery here when I relay Liam in

766
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,540
discovering so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so when that</font>

767
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,130

772
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,490
signaling that is in war so the

773
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,529
subsequently once the authentication is

774
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:21,040
finished then the rpi ripple comes into

775

be a routing direct child entry so in

778
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:31,299
the example that you've seen here if you

779
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:33,609
see the p3 the node n3 has to routing

possible to make such an entries in

00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:36,330
which case you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out a</font>

804
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:39,100
solution based on ipv6 ntp ipv6 NDP RFC

805
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,930
656 sense and five already defines a

810
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:58,930
quick comment so in six loader is work

811
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:01,510
on new neighbor discovery for cut shred

812
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,629
network so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be good to see how</font>

813
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,190
this relates to that work there's one

814
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,260
lightweight never discovery secure like

815
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:11,050
whatever discovery I think it will be

816
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,840
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the six lo session is it</font>

817
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:19,000
tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you will be good to know how</font>

818
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,190
how this one yeah so this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there two</font>

819
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,840
considerations for this draft one is the

820
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,300
signaling considerations another is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

821
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,710
policy how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually populate the</font>

822
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,780
table which all entries how do you

823
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,330
retain the increase which all entries do

824
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,010
you give the priorities so the signaling

825
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,440
considerations we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding any new</font>

826
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,470
signaling here we are as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible</font>

827
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,310
depending upon the existing

828
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,609
specifications from six<font color="#E5E5E5"> low working</font>

829
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,810
group towards doing the signaling but in

830
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,660
certain cases we are recommending

831
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,120
certain things for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case of</font>

832
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,279
ripple if you directly use di o dau

833
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,990
messaging to populate the neighbor cache

834
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,240
entries then there is an added the

835
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:58,569
additional overhead of ipv6 NDP

836
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:04,390
messaging is saved so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

837
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:06,430
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it relates so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

838
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,020
different neighbor management operations

839
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,609
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are three primary operations</font>

840
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> installation eviction and the</font>

841
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:15,490
reinforcement so as part of insertion if

842
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:17,140
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a simple logic as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this is the policy that is</font>

846
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:26,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">with this this particular policy is that</font>

848
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:31,259
in case of ripple there is a multicast

entry based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this di oh then it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">overflow with all the parent entries</font>

854

similarly if the same parent is chosen

855
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,490
by all the child nodes then the same

856

parent will have all the Dow entries

857
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:51,419
coming to it and the neighbor cache

same parent so it not only impacts that

870
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:27,480
impacts that child but all the complete

871
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:29,700
subtree behind beneath that<font color="#E5E5E5"> child now</font>

872
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,279
one of the important consideration here

873
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,740
is if you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where everything</font>

874
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:36,900
non-preferred parent and see now

875
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,118
everything non-preferred parent neighbor

876
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,630
cache entry is usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible without</font>

877
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:46,529
much implications what I mean here is if

878
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:47,819
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten parents to be say that are</font>

879
00:51:46,529 --> 00:51:51,720
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the table neighbor cache</font>

880
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:53,009
entries then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Evek one</font>

881
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,098
of the parent entries and make space

882
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:59,160
available for some other other other so

883
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:01,859
my point is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily evict a non</font>

884
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,930
non preferred parent NC and make the

885
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:05,160
spacer will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now this</font>

886
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the considerations that we</font>

887
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,078

00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:30,119
is to keep a different lifetime for such

this is one of part of the

recommendation that is done by the draft

948
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,759
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what is the signaling what</font>

949
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,340
is the signaling<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for neighbor to</font>

950
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,930
neighbor entry management so if you see

951
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,570
there are three flows that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> specified</font>

952
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,069
here pra discovery storing mode of

953
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,350
operation and non storing mode of

954
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:02,360
operation yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you need to wind</font>

955
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:05,330
up sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so basically what it says</font>

956
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,340
is that there is a way to do an implicit

957
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,930
signaling as well as explicit signaling

958
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,090
in case of non showing mode of operation

959
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,160
there is there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a requirement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

960
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:16,400
do and explicit signaling in the form of

961
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,049
NS with aro option while in case of

<font color="#E5E5E5">launch in case of storing mode of</font>

964
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,470
our messaging in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRA discovery</font>

965
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is an unsecure Dennis for which</font>

966
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:28,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a unsecured na so there is a</font>

967
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:34,100

969
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:41,089
life is so the sample policy now this is

970
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the critical point here the</font>

971
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:46,400
sample policy is based on reservation so

972
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,170
you have a tablespace you make a

973
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">reservation for routing direct child's</font>

974
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:54,650
as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> pyaari authentication</font>

975
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:56,510
sessions now if the parent elements can

00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,640
be occupy the parent elements can be

977
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,260
filled<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in all the places because it</font>

978
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,830
is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to edit those entries if</font>

979
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:06,950
required so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is that the table</font>

980
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:08,360
space will be properly utilized in case

981
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,500
routing childs are not available<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

982
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,860
authentication sessions are not

983
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,480

984
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned on this slide is about the</font>

graceful rejection of Dow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> panel</font>

986
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,730
messages so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of implicit</font>

987
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,500
signaling it is important that there has

00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,000
to be some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rejection mechanism</font>

989
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,980
available in the signaling for example

990
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,870
if you send a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dow the table is full</font>

991
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,270
there is a Dow with negative

but similarly in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> penna signaling</font>

994
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,060
such a negative mechanism is not

available this negative signaling is not

996
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,430
available so you can't really use pen I

998
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:47,169
for signaling the next piece

999
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,859
some of the issues that we have faced is

1000
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:54,049
now this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reactive policy you send</font>

1001
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:58,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">a Dow you send the NS and then it gets</font>

1003
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:03,379
example if a parent nodes neighbor cache

1004
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:05,419
is full and it sends a DI oh there is a

1005
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,670
good chance that some other child might

1006
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,099
come up and select that node as a parent

1007
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,349
so how would this child come to No Child

1008
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:16,039
load come to know that the parent does

1009
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:17,959
not have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> space available so the</font>

1010
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:19,999
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no way to know this</font>

1011
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:21,319
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

1012
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:23,390
reactive policy so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1013
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:25,459
recommending here is there might be some

1014
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:27,140
solution possible based on a proactive

1015
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:30,950
approach for example the NC the neighbor

1016
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:34,989
cache entry metric has to be advertised

1017
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:39,229
as part of di oh hello this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1018
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:41,599
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NC metric has to be advertised</font>

1019
00:57:39,229 --> 00:57:43,038
as part of di o messaging now one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1020
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,930
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that this</font>

1021
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,329
proactive approach applies to not only

1022
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:50,180
the ripple protocol but as well to the

1023
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:52,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pinet discovery message incredible now</font>

1024
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,140
the metric containers that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

1025
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:56,059
with the ripple has to be shared between

1026
00:57:54,140 --> 00:58:00,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">panel discovery messaging as well as</font>

1027
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:03,109
ripple anyways currently based on the

1028
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,269
drab so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question that is</font>

1029
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:06,828
asked here can ripple matrix containers

1030
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:09,258
be reused by another protocol and I

1031
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:11,059
don't see any reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why but I would</font>

1032
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:13,849
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take an opinion about from the</font>

1033
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:15,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group if someone else thinks</font>

1034
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:23,170
that it cannot be reused then you would

1035
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:23,169
like to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> X like this</font>

1036
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:30,490
yeah so basically there are some

1037
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,410
questions that we have asked here should

1038
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:34,660
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider a signaling extension in for</font>

1039
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:37,450
proactive mode not as part of this draft

1040
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:40,810
because this is this specifically the

1041
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:43,509
guidelines and policy draft and secondly

1042
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:46,380
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question regarding how do</font>

1043
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:50,830
other implementations take care of

1044
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:52,600
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out or discovering the how would</font>

1045
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,370
the parent node come to know about the

1046
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,799
global ipv6 address of the child<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

1047
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:58,569
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is required</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for resolving the</font>

1048
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,010
solid cheddar so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1049
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,670
questions that we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font>

1050
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:09,730
working group implement a if the any

1051
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:12,420
implement as available and call for here

1052
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,420
so

1053
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:23,359
lots of information submitter

1054
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">chakrabarti</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we physics Larry co-chair so</font>

1055
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:32,299
I I provide that in in this document<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1056
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:35,720
proposal you have multiple solutions put

1057
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:40,369
together in one document especially one

1058
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:46,299
with ripple or pure NDP are with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pana</font>

1059
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:49,940
for distribution of your NC parameters

1060
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:53,559
to my mind I'm not hundred percent clear

1061
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:58,460
about the charter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> l week but I'm</font>

1062
00:59:53,559 --> 01:00:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking it may it seemed to me that it</font>

1063
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:06,109
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> divided into different he says</font>

1064
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:09,319
like it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think you can</font>

1065
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:12,140
implement it it without any changes in

1066
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:17,119
either six slope and neighbor discovery

1067
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:21,348
or roll so I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1068
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:27,440
probably present in respective groups

1069
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:29,240
and get somebody in because I see there

1070
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,589
are some other work also going on

1071
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:36,919
especially I know in six low so how it

1072
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:38,720
was mentioned by mohit before as one so

1073
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,990
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about it</font>

1074
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and please check if it makes sense so as</font>

1075
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,618
part of this work we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> considering</font>

1076
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:47,660
only the implementation guidelines and

1077
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:50,270
if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> any extensions that have to</font>

1078
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,980
be done then we go about according to I

1079
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,420
mean whatever the working group relevant

1080
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,119
working group is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in case of</font>

1081
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,430
you if if the proactive approach has to

1082
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,290
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed then we go with the role</font>

1083
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,669
working group or if there is any

1084
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,400
signaling change for that matter

1085
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,809
somewhere else then we go accordingly

1086
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,450
with that working group so as of now

1087
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:10,430
this job does not make any this is an

1088
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,859
informational around wrap I think

1089
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,029
they're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time so so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1090
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:16,130
good samhita that you have this

1091
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,720
conversation offline with them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1092
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,430
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mail English then we</font>

1093
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,230
figure out like how to do this logistic

1094
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">here thank you very much thank you</font>
