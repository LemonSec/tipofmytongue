that we would the data cracker would

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,710
decide that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

74
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward but by what could be</font>

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,859
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and then at the end</font>

76
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,680
if anyone has any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other business</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">insistence so i get to RFC's published</font>

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,490
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> david course I'd one is the RTP</font>

95
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:58,379
circuit breakers and the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:01,770
the RTP multi-stream so yeah even better

97
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:03,680
than we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh yeah so that</font>

believe all of these are blocking bundle

100
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:16,310
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh splicing as well</font>

101
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:23,520
that's why things are ions and i'll see

102
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:25,319
if your eye on oxy b-52 3285<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace all</font>

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,159

104
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,449
three unbundle so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think now great rid</font>

105
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,830
is probably also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the qat budget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

106
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,539
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter anyway they're all in</font>

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,818
this rest the screens are basically

108
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,949
we're done unless anything here comes up

109
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,029
in all 48 which hopefully it was and

110
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">even then that's mostly between the</font>

111
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:44,789
authors in this and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC editor so</font>

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,300
that's also that also counts as

113
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:51,060
productive for us and then milestones is

114
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:57,959
this Corp you still have to do so let's

115

which you decide that and that i'd like

129
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,240
to get cleared up first that should be

130
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,949
easy enough in particular there were

131
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,230
some comments and the Shepherd's review

132
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,089
about some outstanding reviews that I

133
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,480
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they happened or if</font>

134
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,300

137
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,570
through the side is what should happen I

138
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,040
mean I am of course happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Magnus and</font>

don't find if you want me I can just

147
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:43,579
have me finish that it's probably if

148
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,620
you're not to try to have to have

152
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:57,670
reviews that then I'll have to go back

153
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,290
because as far as I as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I remember</font>

154
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,479
then we did all of it it just for the

155
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,579
SLPP was the last change<font color="#E5E5E5"> look because</font>

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,610

158
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,920
that was the comment that were made to

159
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,459
the I think to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IDF last call about</font>

160
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,660

<font color="#E5E5E5">stunt attract no comment</font>

174
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,290
up to to us to do that so that's that's

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:13,800
a problem of the documents have created

176

defend the SS policy we have lots of

policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are inconsistent it don't</font>

182
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:31,170
always start an effort to change

183
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,829
policies all it takes is a RFC updating

184
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,779
some other RFC I have to say I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

185
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:41,010
terribly enthusiastic about doing new

186
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,510
workout security descriptions um I tend

187
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,069
to agree on that too now actually oh

188
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,269
we're talking yeah we're talking about

189
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,949
security descriptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep being the</font>

190
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,529
2's says it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

191
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:51,689
one there's reasons for that policy oh

192
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:56,250
is that part of the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using</font>

193
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:58,050
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I mean I mean so I</font>

194
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,920
guess the question I would always have

195
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,149
this arm given that we want to

196
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,420
discourage you or using the strict

197
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,490
security descriptions do you know do we

198
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:14,010
actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish the RAS very</font>

199
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:16,290
descriptive news at all I mean it's not

200
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean this this document doesn't do</font>

201
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:24,149
anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it's just registered</font>

202
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,500
this security profile in in the registry

203
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,199
that's all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean because they</font>

204
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,149
are not by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right surface is</font>

205
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:34,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in its informational or</font>

206
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:38,070
something that's that's there but it's

207
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,569
it just they only I had a problem also

208
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,060
with this comment saying we don't want

209
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a standard dr. Eck document</font>

210
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:48,020
registering something that is not that

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,730
is a sum that it's a country-specific

212
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:56,340
codec or something but I mean the

213
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,930
registry should be more easier to handle

214
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,000
on this case I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand what's</font>

215
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,040
the White was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place in and</font>

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,630
the answers I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a not releasing the</font>

217
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,699
answers i got when i try to figure out

218
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,290
why this like that they were saying we

219
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,430
don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> i we just did it this way</font>

220
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,050
there's no really thought behind it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

221
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,729
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it connects I think the registry</font>

222
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,370
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it is because when you're</font>

223
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,010
updating something as fundamental of the

224
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,230
security of this stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be</font>

225
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:26,960
reviewed by the working group that was

226
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:30,510
it right SFTP investigation required

227
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,790
right so maybe that's wrong do we care

228
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,290
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you know it was it was they</font>

229
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">just were formed at different times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

230
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,480
different like by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time we were on</font>

231
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls srtp the general motivation at ITF</font>

232
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,080
that the wind had shifted to the we

233
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,550
should let anybody register anything

234
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,170
they want otherwise they just sit on our

235
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,579
code point so they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be free for</font>

236
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,229
everyone unless there's not enough of

237
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">them are something like we're discussing</font>

238
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,220
so it doesn't really matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm is there</font>

239
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,870
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of these registration policies</font>

240
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,790
causing a problem now other than their

241
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,950
inconsistent I guess I well I guess the

242
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,980
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get a EDF consensus</font>

243
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:06,960
on registering this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VRA people</font>

244
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,450
want which is right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that attract so</font>

245
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,730
I I think that what we do is only the

246
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,130
registration of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code point not the</font>

247
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,720
Aria underlying outlet right yeah i mean

248
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">what why couldn't we it should be like</font>

249
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:24,900
10 seconds yeah I hear you know yeah who

250
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:26,520
does anyone object to doing oh a

251
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,540
corroded the great the security ad

252
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,819
object um no but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just know but he</font>

253
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:39,170
objects to area being a standard tracks

254
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,170
algorithm write something which is not

255
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay originally stewed work two or one</font>

256
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:55,709
right and the objection was that that

257
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:58,649
seemed to give Aria the cachet of a

258
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,809
standard strike draft so now we've split

259
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,850
them right so the srtp one and the one

260
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,368
that's describing the I think the ones

261
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,649
describing the cipher suite is is

262
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:09,449
informational and that's what we're

263
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:11,910
talking about today the one that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,170
one that is before they<font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font>

265
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,540
the working group has to figure out what

266
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,740
they want to do with the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font>

267
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,379
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do here maybe I was</font>

268
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,050
up there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I you know</font>

269
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,579
personally I had the problem with you

270
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,660
know the security descriptions

271
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:29,339
registration being a senator document

272
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,309
but I just worried that trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

273
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:35,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">secor that we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a ITF consensus</font>

274
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:37,110
on a cipher double cipher he doesn't

275
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,920
like using a key mechanism he doesn't

276
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,029
like might be challenging you know

277
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,259
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just need to be</font>

278
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,809
challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a DS I don't mind</font>

279
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,339
helping with that um look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

280
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,829
you know my point of view is if the

281
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,410
working group decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on this</font>

282
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,149
work and put a milestone for it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

283
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,240
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time we more or less agreed to</font>

284
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,009
give it a code point um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

285
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,540
that that's ridiculous to go back on all

286
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,529
those decisions at this point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

287
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,179
mean we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got exactly the right</font>

288
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,889
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I strongly support what we're</font>

289
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,619
doing and I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to argue with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:11,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">isg it's the right thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so have</font>

291
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:13,619
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> emits calling volunteer to argue my</font>

292
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,939
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kristen yeah I mean in the</font>

293
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,699
discussion we had before I think he's

294
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:19,290
lost meeting I think it Chris position

295
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,868
was that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is having different</font>

296
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,868
policy it wouldn't be considered vetted

297
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,459
by ITF and therefore not really approved

298
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,379
so that's what did receive a shame to

299
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,149
policy but I think the right thing you

300
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:39,089
asked out to do with area it's just to

301
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:41,660
push it through next milestone is called

302
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:44,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our duty which is your own video a</font>

303
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
bonus

304
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,660
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i think the last</font>

305
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:56,480
time we met we discussed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a year</font>

306
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,030
ago and the output of that was that

307
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,090
we're ready the documents ready it needs

308
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,949
some work on the Security section but

309
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">apart from that it needs wider review I</font>

310
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,890
think some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wallin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tiered but i</font>

311
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,540
did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any feedback so i guess we</font>

312
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,620
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing again</font>

313
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,438
anybody want to go on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this time</font>

314
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,929
and actually mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're pointing at</font>

315
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,600
somebody who you're putting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hemel oml</font>

316
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,170
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone Emil volunteered last time or</font>

317
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:32,389
yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email looks very shocked with</font>

318
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,590
this in some fantasy where think it

319
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,230
means like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago you volunteer</font>

320
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,760
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> leader taka yeah but one was not</font>

321
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,640
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need more so okay</font>

322
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,180
anybody else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to volunteer a</font>

323
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,560
beautiful image ideally with the time

324
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,880
with a deadline I'm not volunteering but

325
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,320
I'd like to sort of feel like you should

326
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,320
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get Ted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardy to review it uh</font>

327
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:02,300
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're different work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you do</font>

328
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,350
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to volunteer any of people</font>

329
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:10,070
work for your column does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that give the</font>

330
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:12,500
or 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so that being said I</font>

331
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,210
guess the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here is that it</font>

332
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,850
needs to view I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expired</font>

333
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,160
today so I guess the question I should I

334
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:22,399
just do my bit orchard job I mean I'd

335
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,970
say if you want to go keep alive and the

336
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,330
reference update is to make show that

337
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,500
it's still there all right i mean the

338
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,120
graphics firing doesn't matter very much

339
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,470
with you sued because they actually

340
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:40,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">still say enough accessible but it can't</font>

341
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,650
get never hurt her own even so what do

342
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,820
you want to be able to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and plus</font>

343
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:50,180
cold for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep user sounds like I mean</font>

344
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,280
if you know that there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

345
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,990
patience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> variances probably</font>

346
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,660
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for from the past all but I</font>

347
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,779
think certainly doing a set of reviews

348
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,539
for free

349
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powered here yeah I think it would be</font>

350
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,429
nice because it's being implemented and

351
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,049
by various people and I've gotten

352
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,719
feedback from implementers so it's kind

353
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,950
of ready from that perspective a last

354
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,629
time we discussed that we should put

355
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,820
something for security there and there's

356
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:18,689
some discussion of like with what way we

357
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:22,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with this I believe some</font>

358
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:26,789
people in in the IETF are working on NPR

359
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:28,109
DP with srtp do TLS thing some we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

360
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,999
have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that we just have to</font>

361
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:34,468
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there might be multiple ways of</font>

362
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:39,719
doing this yeah probably even site there

363
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:42,330
you could cite the you know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

371
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,408
is asking something that huh I was on

372

378
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiplexing guidelines I think oh so</font>

379
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,760
that's all multi thought okay that's

380

382
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:56,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">in aiding review so it's better there</font>

383
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:59,820
anything cooking there<font color="#E5E5E5"> just or find us</font>

384
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,500
what you up like it but then it's like a

385
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,200
mile and a half to walk yeah some yeah

386
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,930
minus with lunch yes so there's two

387
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:12,630
comments which<font color="#CCCCCC"> shacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs what I think</font>

388
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:14,970
yeah so but yeah they are not closed yet

389
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:19,380
but it's remember how do you think that

390
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:22,010
I actually remembered olive oil I just

391
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,440
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new one is one is about</font>

392
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:29,310
security security requirements on

393
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">related to stp offer answer and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brownie</font>

394
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:35,070
game you the first comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about</font>

395
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,850
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> texture about that you can</font>

396
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:43,649
do it if you because it's negotiated

397
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:45,840
support for the tube a mode that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it</font>

398
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,430
support both or one bite and to bite but

399
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,030
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a cop there was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texture</font>

400
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,860
saying that you can do it also if even

401
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,780
if you're no negotiation if you have

402
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,260
some other ways to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

403
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,530
other side supports that and that was

404
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the comment from from been about it the</font>

405
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that is that it's because it</font>

406
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,530
mostly was because in the cases where

407
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,660
you're doing a declarative sdp you don't

408
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,970
get a response in we don't know if the

409
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side supporters and in order to do</font>

410
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,290
this mix of one back to do by then you

411
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,200
have to know that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is supported by</font>

412
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,790
some other means that's the major reason

413
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,710
for that it was not saying that

414
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,710
negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing</font>

415
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,040
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this now or</font>

416
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,650
you want us to take it offline it's

417
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,420
pretty easy so I'm is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

418
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,010
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> downer I mean it get</font>

419
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,920
something quick to say otherwise quickly

420
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:46,200
going to say that one could say when

421
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:51,230
using oftener answer one must if one is

422
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,910
using the other mechanisms all right and

423
00:22:51,230 --> 00:23:02,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about the second issue where</font>

424
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:04,170
did yeah yeah yeah and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

425
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,639
question I have is what you do with

426
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,810
Shepherd for that and you want to keep

427
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can continue considering that we</font>

428
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> already native elation so you</font>

429
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,930
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never does not a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

430
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of them oh yeah yes so I expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

431
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:30,930
only to do an update here to resolve

432
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:33,860
this so all right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not now</font>

433
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,860
mother put some guidelines

434
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay recap of history here so</font>

435
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:53,899
multiplexing guidelines in all those one

436
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,120
a half years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Yokohama we</font>

437
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,960
discussed this document and considered

438
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scope it down focus it</font>

439
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,580
etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a significant editor</font>

440
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,260
task which I I kind of took on but never

441
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:12,679
have gotten to each other things so and

442
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,110
and the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there anyone who's</font>

443
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,000
actually willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do any editing on it</font>

444
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,879
now so I I might suggest if you actually

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop this milestone rather than keep on</font>

446
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm doing it would be good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

447
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,790
document but I don't know I I don't

448
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time for I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

449
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:32,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is this document um you</font>

450
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,560
know is it like a needed I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,230
that there was I feel like it was sort

452
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,360
of a it's all such a position paper when

453
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,400
we were fearing a bundle but now that

454
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,629
bundle is in consent as we have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

455
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
less consensus on what that looks like

456
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,160
it is still needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so I mean that's</font>

457
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">opposed to kind of refocus and say okay</font>

458
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,480
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear on giving actual</font>

459
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,060
guidance form from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the position</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

460
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,150
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bongo a little all other things</font>

461
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,040
come into place let's say so it's it

462
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,960
would be good I still think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

463
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,080
figure out most of it from other sources

464
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,260
but it's just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you have to look</font>

465
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,169
in round bits to figure out how its land

466
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,360
lies saying what to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but</font>

467
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:15,770
yeah I I think it's there's lack of

468
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,679
energy to actually complete this so

469
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,080
Ronnie Evan so but I thought madness are

470
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:27,200
there any documents that reference is

471
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">documented information yes there are a</font>

472
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:40,070
few reference on it so but it's what and

473
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:42,410
it shows up<font color="#CCCCCC"> by thinking in the multiple</font>

474
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,919
media types for example and it shows up

475
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,830
in the how to pay love how to write file

476
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:55,670
formats I think that's too which I know

477
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:57,929
why would be sad say word Robin a

478
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,610
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to publish document it</font>

479
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,650
turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in the web RTC</font>

480
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,810
dependency check I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

481
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,420
look it up well it's it's an information

482
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,280
reference anyway and I mean I can go

483
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,560
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at how it drifted because</font>

484
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,360
I looked at this in the for the how-to

485
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,540
and said trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically removed</font>

486
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,240
from their sub because it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

487
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,800
that needed in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> document some of</font>

488
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,300
these similar in this rap that means

489
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've already been approved</font>

490
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,340
publication model of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean these</font>

491
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,810
documents should be an information

492
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,760
anywhere being you finish reference it's

493
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,649
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocking in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documents so you</font>

494
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,860
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get published as a reference to</font>

495
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,920
the final vertically ID you wrote no I'm

498
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,700
make clear what what's the reference

499
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:50,520
this exists and what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of</font>

500
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">energy to finish it must of the Collin I</font>

501

555
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,110
the other topologies but the key point

556
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:08,990
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle box that wants to</font>

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,070
architectures may not even be able to

560
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,470
perform the decryption may not have been

561
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:21,290
Dinky's required to look at the at the

562
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,050
media payload so<font color="#E5E5E5"> work would be a prime</font>

563
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,450
example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean even if it did have</font>

564
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the keys for for scale it would be</font>

565
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,820
advantageous<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid having to</font>

566
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:34,070
decryption if it could so that's another

567
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,770
motivation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally you can</font>

568
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,320
design your middle boxes hopefully to be

569
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">payload agnostic so that even future</font>

570
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,860
payload formats can be supported

571
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">transparently and that's another goal of</font>

572
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,120
this work so that all media payloads

573
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,580
that conform to certain basic

574
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,169
requirements can use the same header

575
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,850
extension and allow the middle box do

576
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,870
forwarding decisions without even

577
00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:01,179
knowing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload is next slide</font>

578
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:03,469
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some other motivations around</font>

579
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,290
improving the operation of both the

580
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:09,590
middle box and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end points we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

581
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:12,680
better recovery when you have packet

582
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,590
loss scenarios identifying where the

583
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,770
start and end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frames are is tricky</font>

584
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,560
with current payload floor mats and this

585
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,360
unifies it and makes it more robust you

586
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,050
can do clean video switching at<font color="#E5E5E5"> iframes</font>

587
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,389
so you can identify when each recipient

588
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:33,399
has all of the packets necessary for

589
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:36,320
intra refresh and under congestion

590
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,030
switches can make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

591
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,300
relative importance of packets so if it

592
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,440
has the draw

593
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,690
packets towards a particular endpoints

594
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,330
downlink it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an intelligent</font>

595
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,580
decision about that drop and they can

596
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,370
drop entire layers if it wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

597
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,669
down the the quality of a particular

598
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,449
stream to a particular receiver and

599
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,230
endpoints can also use this header

600
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:01,390
extension for some of the same benefits

601
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:04,240
the better information about starting in

602
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,850
frame markers allow better recovery so

603
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,600
you don to decode and display dirty

604
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:14,500
artifacts next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is the</font>

605
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,429
extension as it stands right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if you</font>

606
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:21,340
remember in the last version we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

607
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:24,250
forked it into two different versions of

608
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:28,600
it a short form in a long form so this

609
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:31,030
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full long form it has the layer</font>

610
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,120
IDs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> did layer ID and teals there</font>

611
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,330
pickin index fields and that's when you

612
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,800
have length equals 2 and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 285</font>

613
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:45,189
length is 11 plus so 2 here actually

614
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,010
means three<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes following it that's</font>

615
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,560
the long form<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the short form if you</font>

616
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,720
put length 0 then you only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one bite</font>

617
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:58,060
afterwards which is basically the flags

618
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:02,370
the frame flags sei DB and the rest of

619
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:06,550
the course of the fields are emitted

620
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:10,719
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please so the changes that we</font>

621
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,460
made there were some comments about what

622
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,680
if the middle box doesn't have all the

623
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,400
information required<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the layer</font>

624
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDs and so the earlier verte in version</font>

625
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,980
3 we said that the short form was only

626
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,780
for non scalable strains so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

627
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,430
no scalability in the stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the</font>

628
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,510
short form if you have skilled lid in

629
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stream you have to use a long form</font>

630
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:37,620
and so there was English to type out

631
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their reversed</font>

632
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:45,270
no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's right so okay it's it's</font>

633
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">contort head it was for the nonce Caleb</font>

634
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,090
all right the short header was for the

635
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,040
non scalable and it was only for the non

636
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,300
scalable in version 3 there were

637
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,500
comments about what if the middle box

638
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,580
knows it's forwarding scalable streams

639
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,250
but it doesn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the</font>

640
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:05,520
scalability and so it's allowing the

641
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,350
middle box to use the short header even

642
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,550
for the scalable streams so I know I

643
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,190
stream is scalable but I really don't

644
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what the layer IDs of it are so I</font>

645
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:21,500
can still use the short form so the text

646
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:25,080
is there they we recommend using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

647
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,659
short header for non scalable streams

648
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,429
but you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> also use it for scalable</font>

649
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,020
streams if you don't have information

650
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:36,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the scalability and then the flip</font>

651
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,389
side of that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also allowed so you can</font>

652
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:42,989
use the long version the full full

653
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:44,940
extension even if you're forwarding non

654
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,520
scalable streams and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be a</font>

655
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,250
simplification and some and some boxes

656
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,790
to have uniformity of the the headers as

657
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,610
they go out and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that you</font>

658
00:34:53,790 --> 00:35:04,110
must you must set all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

659
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:05,340
scalability layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs 20 right that</font>

660
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:13,950
would everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> was fine with that</font>

661
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:18,510
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next changes a lrr there</font>

662
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:22,140
was a request<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have lrr and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> framework</font>

663
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">harmonized and so Jonathan I had a at a</font>

664
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,319
talk and we look at the different fields

665
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:30,899
and um we think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need it</font>

666
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,450
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a message a few a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

667
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,850
before the meeting started about vp9

668
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">payload format the VP not scalability</font>

669
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:41,069
fields and I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's correct</font>

670
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:45,390
it needs to be updated this version of

671
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft still reflects the old pre</font>

672
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,900
working group version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp9 draft so</font>

673
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,339
vp9 changed its scalability information

674
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,529
along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and I think we needed</font>

675
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:57,038
update to include<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

676
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:59,990
still has been for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need for lr</font>

677
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,029
yeah so I had a question Mel I know for

678
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,038
temporal scalability we have the tl's

679
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:05,480
Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick index so if you lose a base</font>

680
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,180
layer frame you can figure out what

681
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,400
depended on it jonathan is we have

682
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,399
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a loss of say a spatial</font>

683
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:26,119
packet to figure out what what the

684
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:29,750
dependencies are young bucks arm as an

685
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:33,289
individual so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

686
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,510
because I so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean obviously if you</font>

687
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:39,170
have a codec where your layers are

688
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,819
numbered sequentially you do but there's

689
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,490
some that are particularly to the tour

690
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:44,869
SVC i think is the DQ ID so they're

691
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:48,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually almost always not going to be</font>

692
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:56,180
sequential arm in which case no you

693
00:36:48,799 --> 00:37:00,559
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so in that case yeah you</font>

694
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,240
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know somehow what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> structure</font>

695
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,670
of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if you're a</font>

696
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,250
situation where you know how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leds</font>

697
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,180
are interpreted then you can presumably

698
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:12,559
but the part of this is that you can be

699
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,750
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a router which is agnostic to</font>

700
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,579
what L IDs which doesn't know anything

701
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the codec that's doesn't know how</font>

702
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:24,650
all I these are encoded so good

703
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,819
competition yeah so basically so you

704
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:32,059
know I like the first is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for on</font>

705
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:34,490
agencies for SVC stream your LEDs will

706
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:36,079
actually be numbered something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

707
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:41,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">many bits it is but it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only like 0 8</font>

708
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:44,119
16 24 because the the Q the Q layer is

709
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,460
the bottom three bits and the others and

710
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:50,480
the D layer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper bits so you</font>

711
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,599
like so uh a box which is ignorant of

712
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SVC you know sees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer 0 let's</font>

713
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,359
seize they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I panicked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

714
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:03,440
my god i'm missing layered or something

715
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:04,520
so I'm so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think we list</font>

716
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,870
something information what

717
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,390
put in the headers themselves because

718
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,920
it's big putting in the signaling of

719
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,900
your heart i'm not sure what you're

720
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,030
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the scalability</font>

721
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,530
structures yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full scale in</font>

722
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,940
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

723
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,340
full scalability structure would be

724
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,930
sufficient but big and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

725
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,580
necessary definitely not for framework

726
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,750
yeah no I don't think so so unless you

727
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,799
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somehow send it out a band or</font>

728
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:30,380
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause of it so um yeah so that</font>

729
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,570
the current graph does not say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

730
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,400
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids should be interpreted</font>

731
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,800
sequentially it does say that that

732
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,020
higher ID zindagi up higher right

733
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,220
fidelity yeah but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

734
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,930
assumption that they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

735
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,450
contiguous in it and of course the

736
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,100
mappings show there's bit fields within

737
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:50,589
those right so you should know is I

738
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:54,200
guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is kind of kind of a</font>

739
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:56,300
canvas you know Kotick agnostic middle

740
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,730
box tell if something we know whence

741
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,340
when something's missing it upgrade and

742
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,080
the answer is no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it can't tell</font>

743
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,120
when something is missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something's</font>

744
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,950
missing basically like 40 0 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick index</font>

745
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,080
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the temporal layers if</font>

746
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:16,730
you're missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dependency but with</font>

747
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:20,120
spatial you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

748
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,400
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> B bit which is whether or not</font>

749
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a base layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> siloso be layers</font>

750
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,920
in the be faced our sink which likely is

751
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,620
another point I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to let me</font>

752
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,070
finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't miss much it um is but I</font>

753
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:34,370
mean so but I guess so the point is that

754
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:36,860
so a them I mean if your situation where

755
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,620
spatial layers are always the same time

756
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,300
stamp then you can tell just by probably

757
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,730
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whether you are to be</font>

758
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,140
sequence numbers missing you know but

759
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:51,590
you know in you know in sufficiently

760
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,240
weird layering structures you might not

761
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,460
be able to tell but maybe we don't care

762
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,959
I think yeah yeah I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

763
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion before you if your</font>

764
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,490
scalability structure is very complex or

765
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,250
not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's no</font>

766
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">hope of any yeah no hope of any</font>

767
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:10,010
extension that would that would simplify

768
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:13,120
things so it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for if you have a</font>

769
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:15,770
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fixed scalability structure</font>

770
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,970
then then this could be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your</font>

771
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,350
forwarding decisions could be automatic

772
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,990
right otherwise there's really no hope

773
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:24,740
ok so I'm so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick in the</font>

774
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,060
draft saying you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for you</font>

775
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,890
know scalability structures that follow

776
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,029
these don't use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for complicated</font>

777
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,589
scalability structures because you'll

778
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,550
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of basically</font>

779
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,380
have some sort of applicability

780
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,210
statement saying these are the sort of

781
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">scalability structures you should use</font>

782
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,750
this for don't use it for anything else

783
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll just confuse people right</font>

784
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,890
okay my dad say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a good</font>

785
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,530
clarification dr. arm the other coming

786
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:48,200
to heaven lrr<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good i</font>

787
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,000
would strengthen so to the one thing I'd

788
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,980
add is in addition to saying they are

789
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,510
they they are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same i would say that</font>

790
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're defining this for a new</font>

791
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,040
codec it you know if your freedom ideas

792
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,690
for new codec which supports both lrr

793
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,730
and frame marking it must be the same a

794
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,920
sleaze have a stronger statement saying

795
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,960
for new standards they must we must

796
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,550
encode them the same way ok so just must

797
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,750
correspond to the CI most yet offered

798
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,010
yeah I think they do correspond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

799
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,680
ones who defined and must for anything

800
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,510
future defining prefix using both<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

801
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,470
yeah that's that's a and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

802
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:24,350
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stronger state are just</font>

803
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:26,180
guidelines for so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

804
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,680
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know right doing the right</font>

805
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,850
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the B bit but guidelines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

806
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,859
recognizing when you have a layer

807
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:34,670
refresh point it's probably just do you

808
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:37,970
have the right Dean debt but basically

809
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:42,050
so when how do you know when your lr r

810
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:45,770
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been satisfied he's gonna mean you</font>

811
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:48,290
sendin lrr four you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> al ID you know</font>

812
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,270
four to forty five right you get a

813
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,850
packet in has it been satisfied so maybe

814
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:56,540
that's just you know you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

815
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:59,390
got a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with LED 45 and the me get</font>

816
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,940
set and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be sufficient but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

817
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:06,319
think which at least I've got have

818
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:10,100
statement to that effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay and</font>

819
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,530
then my third comment about the vp9 so

820
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:17,870
no takers getting though these things

821
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:19,070
that have to put in yeah let them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> von</font>

822
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bruener</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could get you to get that I mean</font>

823
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,320
me to clarify what I said once again

824
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,910
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole thing kept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font>

825
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,250
quickly somewhere so you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

826
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,859
first of all you got the must yeah must

827
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:35,960
correspond yeah

828
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:38,620
our must use the same values yeah as as

829
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,630
frame markings yeah and then number two

830
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:45,920
number two was in the frame marking

831
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,720
graphs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just saying I I thought I</font>

832
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,910
need to you know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this is</font>

833
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">correct basically saying that when you</font>

834
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,950
send an<font color="#E5E5E5"> LR are the way you tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

835
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:58,069
lr has been satisfied I think is that

836
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,419
you get a receive a packet or maybe a

837
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,520
start a frame packet this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

838
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,800
detailed who didn't work out with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

839
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,020
bit set and that TI d and li d in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

840
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,960
packet so identifying when layer refresh

841
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,540
has yes through frame working guess

842
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,790
right and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third thing I was</font>

843
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:18,440
going to comment about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've mention</font>

844
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:20,450
about the vp9 I confess that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm moving</font>

845
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,210
very rather slowly on the vp9 payload

846
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,240
format so it might make sense to pull

847
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:29,230
the vp9 stuff out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this draft and move</font>

848
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,540
it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp9 draft saying this is how</font>

849
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,270
you use this is the encoding for frame

850
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,220
marking for vp9<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that would that</font>

851
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">would remove the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss refs that we're</font>

852
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,259
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get exactly a long time yeah</font>

853
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,360
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then that also gives us</font>

854
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,800
a template for how a new payload format

855
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:51,260
should describe how you use it with

856
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,670
frame working<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yep running even just</font>

857
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,730
a question about the point you made

858
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,440
about the was the lrr why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

859
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,170
important that when you sent it in are

860
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,810
all you have to to review it review it

861
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,490
in the frame art<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's it's mostly</font>

862
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,810
you have to know it when the encoding

863
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,600
but I don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need it</font>

864
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:14,210
for me to be to identify it in the frame

865
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:17,870
of um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan so I mean the the goal</font>

866
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:20,690
here is that I wanted to be possible for

867
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:23,799
this codec agnostic middle box to

868
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:26,390
actually both send them receive lr ours

869
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,710
so that he can do the layer reefer he

870
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:33,589
can handle the layer refresh without

871
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:37,220
buying the hood a I guess you could

872
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,720
avoid forwarding you know partial layer

873
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,279
information that you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

874
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,220
receiver is not going to be able to

875
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,940
because you could avoid sending him bad

876
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,859
date

877
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:53,330
useless data then I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could also</font>

878
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:58,430
start start sending them good data when

879
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:59,990
when the switching points<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived so</font>

880
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ronald so it will not be that simple</font>

881
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,529
because the middle books will also need

882
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppress the request that may come</font>

883
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote side that would</font>

884
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,010
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that I mean it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I</font>

885
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,990
definitely don't plan the document of

886
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,750
that in frame working I was just

887
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:17,540
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> the when you receive a frame</font>

888
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,340
marking what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean and and and</font>

889
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,920
when do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that means the</font>

890
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,440
lower refresh happened so we can put

891
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that part of this in the spec complex</font>

892
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,980
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thick should go on the lrr</font>

893
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:33,910
little box considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

894
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:42,190
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in lr are we good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

895
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:45,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay one other thing that um</font>

896
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:48,970
Bernard I think brought up was<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh how</font>

897
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:52,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">does this work with repair streams and</font>

898
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:55,009
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> updated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document to show that</font>

899
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> only applies to the source RTP</font>

900
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:00,950
streams not to the repair streams and

901
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,600
specifically only to video payloads so

902
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,430
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to use this for audio</font>

903
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,310
or for fact or retransmission payloads

904
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:10,069
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work it's not specified</font>

905
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:13,100
here you need of the draft for that now

906
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll note though that really probably</font>

907
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:20,360
what you want is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recover the original</font>

908
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:22,580
packets markings from<font color="#CCCCCC"> r-tx or effect and</font>

909
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,410
the RTX effect format will tell you

910
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,390
usually how to do that how to recover

911
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:30,080
header extensions that were on the

912
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:33,830
original packet so it wouldn't be this

913
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,720
draft showing how how those packets get

914
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,060
marked it would be the repair format

915
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,600
would actually show how to preserve the

916
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:44,420
header extension of the original packet

917
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:46,549
and Magnus wisdom I guess that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

918
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,580
comes into question how you structure

919
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,980
your repair<font color="#CCCCCC"> springs I'm thinking about</font>

920
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,140
the park use cases here when you went

921
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,839
when it's encrypted etc you need to

922
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,479
structure the things right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font>

923
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:06,619
can have visibility into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paris</font>

924
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:08,089
dreams yeah that's a son in the we ran

925
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:09,380
to the same issue at flex pack and

926
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:12,828
you'll see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next hour we</font>

927
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a suggestion for the order between</font>

928
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">feckin srtp for for situations like Park</font>

929
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,920
also going back to my previous question

930
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,049
about the lr our stuff then if the

931
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,759
middle books<font color="#CCCCCC"> dozen lrr then there's a</font>

932
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,130
reverse dream but she doesn't know about

933
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,630
it and why should it senator or are in

934
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:35,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first place because I mean it's like</font>

935
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:37,700
bit contradictory in that case what so

936
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:41,329
again Magnus's point if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

937
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,710
architecture you know like part one of

938
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the goals is for the middle box</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

939
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,930
participate in the repair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and not be</font>

940
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,180
blind to the repair so so in that case

941
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the middle box can receive repair and</font>

942
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,578
generate repair if it wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

943
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:57,650
case it would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to you know</font>

944
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:59,150
decide whether or not to forward lr<font color="#CCCCCC"> RS</font>

945
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">or whether it has all the information</font>

946
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:13,119
for the for the lair anyway and despite

947
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:15,619
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lrs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so no objections to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

948
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,469
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this this only</font>

949
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:22,609
specifies source RTP streams and only

950
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:25,160
video payloads I mean anybody ever come

951
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,489
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> where'd audio codec if I have to</font>

952
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,489
look at

953
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so there was a also a</font>

954
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:40,500
previous draft from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernard about</font>

955
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:44,430
general considerations when you're

956
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,990
building in SF you it has a lot of

957
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,899
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it not directly related to</font>

958
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,950
frame markings but some things do

959
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,930
directly relate to frame marking into

960
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous versions we had a reference</font>

961
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:56,100
to it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think the work is</font>

962
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> progress so I think the</font>

963
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,549
decision was to import the parts that

964
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:03,710
are relevant to frame marking so we did

965
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:06,360
that and the most liberal part is

966
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,700
actually we were just discussing a

967
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,760
little while ago the scalability

968
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,560
infrastructures when you have fixed

969
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,670
fixed scalability formats those

970
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,650
scalability structures autistics for

971
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:24,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">male impacts the headers or actually</font>

972
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:27,960
payload units and 265 now in Passy info

973
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:31,830
those those things are pulled over from

974
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,320
the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other aspect so we can we</font>

975
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:37,370
could let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it die if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I if we want to now</font>

976
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,400
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of file reference issue</font>

977
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:43,710
and I think we also need to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vp9</font>

978
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,720
scalability structure oh we will remove

979
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,000
anything about vp9<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheel at the vp9 spec</font>

980
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:55,859
add you can scale scalability structure

981
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:57,480
info<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one so the first point</font>

982
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,300
with open issues that the first point I

983
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were ready this is not going to</font>

984
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:10,830
support redundancy streams the next the

985
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:13,620
next point something that a meal had

986
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:15,930
brought up when looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at looking at</font>

987
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,069
this in the context of<font color="#E5E5E5"> perc probably</font>

988
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,140
longer discussion that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

989
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,310
in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perk session since it's going</font>

990
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,190
to presenting something about about it

991
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:27,060
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-order bit</font>

992
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:30,870
here is that when when a participant or

993
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:33,450
middle box is using RTP to probe the

994
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:34,920
link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may only use padding it's</font>

995
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,200
not actually sending any media payload

996
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,000
at all just using RT padding to probe

997
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,569
the link with different you know bite

998
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,200
lengths

999
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:48,109
the the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in part the</font>

1000
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,240
padding is encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the padding it</font>

1001
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:51,440
length indicator even is encrypted so

1002
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,149
middle box wouldn't know whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1003
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,599
this is real media or padding only media

1004
00:50:53,150 --> 00:51:00,290
so may not know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not afforded</font>

1005
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:04,099
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposals and real spec is</font>

1006
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:06,680
to extend frame markings to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1007
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">indicate that this is padding only one</font>

1008
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,250
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we considered is</font>

1009
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,098
maybe this is a good use of the

1010
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:16,310
discardable bit if the padding only

1011
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:17,960
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marc Marquez discardable and</font>

1012
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,270
middleboxes could drop them if they

1013
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,359
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also another option</font>

1014
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:24,920
is um don't use the real halo type of

1015
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,770
media stream it's a little odd to say

1016
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,260
this is you know 264<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp9 media and you</font>

1017
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just padding probe so you</font>

1018
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:37,460
could use the effect or retransmit

1019
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,650
payload type or or even rtcp something

1020
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:42,530
that's not indicating an actual real

1021
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:44,930
milk media payload type to do that

1022
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,970
probing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be another option so</font>

1023
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,649
if either one of those are acceptable I

1024
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:53,480
think we could avoid the impact to<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame</font>

1025
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:55,730
marking I mean we will show up thanks

1026
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,910
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking that into consideration first</font>

1027
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:01,310
of all it's it's poor suspect expect but

1028
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">credit get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much praise to you and I</font>

1029
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think discardable would not be</font>

1030
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:08,089
enough what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hold your hand</font>

1031
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:14,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">over your mouth when you're talking but</font>

1032
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:16,400
it sounds more mysterious this way so I

1033
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't believe this carnival would work</font>

1034
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,869
because you have this carnival Pakistan

1035
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,030
Yemen and twin and these basically must

1036
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:24,230
be dropped at this DSF you so unless I'm

1037
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,790
missing some clear way you could

1038
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,260
distinguish between the two well I'm

1039
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,779
assuming that this probing phases like

1040
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">precall probing this is not no no it's</font>

1041
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:35,510
dear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> midco probing okay sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

1042
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:38,150
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can try to do here is this</font>

1043
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:39,800
an MP discovery no no this is just

1044
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:43,450
families<font color="#E5E5E5"> they almost never have it</font>

1045
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,450
public or you could do in to you also

1046
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,410
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no actual payload</font>

1047
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:51,618
there's no it's only padding you're not

1048
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:54,049
just padding out a packet so I'm just

1049
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,970
concerned that actually so if you

1050
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,310
send a packet claiming identities for

1051
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:59,990
and say it's only padding but you know

1052
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,520
what you're actually sending is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 wens</font>

1053
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for packet with you thought of</font>

1054
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">validating 645 so I don't see how this</font>

1055
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:17,029
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's oddity on the last</font>

1056
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:21,710
word I mean yes we could it's not

1057
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:25,100
invalid either and every packet is

1058
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,150
required to have an alia together so

1059
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:33,140
it's almost like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a no-op</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's almost</font>

1060
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:36,890
like RTP elephant ya know so no taken up

1061
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,629
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not not trying to defend that</font>

1062
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,879
way of being bandwidth probing that's

1063
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:43,550
how bandwidth probing is happening today

1064
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,560
in chrome specifically I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1065
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:50,180
about Firefox maybe it's the same and

1066
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:54,170
the third bullet there the third dash

1067
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:57,049
there is a very noble goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1068
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:59,750
not how things work today so I I think

1069
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:01,250
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be if you compare the workload</font>

1070
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,280
necessary to get these implementations

1071
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:06,890
to change with the workload necessary to

1072
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:12,140
add a bit that says you can drop this um

1073
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:14,270
I think it's it's clearly easier to just

1074
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,710
to just add that bit not not to mention

1075
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's I mean there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

1076
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,330
with it it's a great so my personal view

1077
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,460
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second the second one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1078
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:25,670
best recommendation that it's it's odd

1079
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:28,250
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> real media pelo types with no</font>

1080
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,840
real media in them sorry and then yet

1081
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:31,340
avoids Jonathan's point to that you

1082
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,860
wouldn't confuse a decoder by sending at

1083
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:36,260
a 00<font color="#E5E5E5"> by agree that this is how things</font>

1084
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be done it's not how things are</font>

1085
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:42,230
done so i am going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would not</font>

1086
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,870
say you know saying we're going to

1087
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:48,980
standardize how chrome currently does

1088
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">WebRTC this is like about you know 95th</font>

1089
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,950
for the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they're currently</font>

1090
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,930
doing wrong but but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to make</font>

1091
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">some change right if we add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in frame</font>

1092
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:58,609
marking the implementation has to change

1093
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,640
to support it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's in a quick</font>

1094
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:03,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and easy change to do the second bullet</font>

1095
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,960
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect payload type for the probing</font>

1096
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,910
that would be to interpreter<font color="#E5E5E5"> us I</font>

1097
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,190
completely understand

1098
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:11,200
these points and it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's just</font>

1099
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:12,369
a matter of implementation preferences

1100
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,689
and they're probably alternative

1101
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:16,329
solutions that we could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at and</font>

1102
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:18,099
/ we have enjoyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grounder or ones</font>

1103
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:23,200
that I figure out your response right um

1104
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:25,059
yeah sure but um we reserve ourselves

1105
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,700
the right to come in beg again for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1106
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:28,900
to be included<font color="#E5E5E5"> in frame markings so if</font>

1107
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,230
anybody's interested there's a in the

1108
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:35,440
perk session there'll be a description

1109
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:38,530
of more detailed description of this end

1110
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,920
and another aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTX formats for park</font>

1111
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,890
and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> padding only formats so we can</font>

1112
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:50,319
follow-up discussion there that's it i

1113
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:51,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">think so i guess we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not ready Wes</font>

1114
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:57,038
long as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to remove the vp9</font>

1115
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:58,240
stuff out of the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll work I'll</font>

1116
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,030
work with you at the Opera see behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1117
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put into the 59 grab yeah</font>

1118
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:07,690
okay other than that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> work we're</font>

1119
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:11,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so hopefully you'll get a</font>

1120
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:14,400
new ground with those feelings of<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing</font>

1121
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:17,079
better looking for contraband all right

1122
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:24,640
all right anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else on good working</font>

1123
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:30,250
it's not do mine my surprise last-minute

1124
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:34,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">additions of draft so yeah this came up</font>

1125
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:35,799
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bully</font>

1126
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:38,500
various implementations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finally</font>

00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving away from scary descriptions and</font>

00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,760
they said but we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1129
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,680
aes-256 what should we do and i said i

1130
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,170
looked at the registry and said hey

1131
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:50,440
there's no registration for aes 256

1132
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:54,789
counter in dtls srtp that's bad so

1133
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:57,299
excellent so well I looked over the I

1134
00:56:54,789 --> 00:57:01,119
did some you know draft archaeology and

1135
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:03,430
discovered that you know the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1136
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,130
became look at those numbers right I

1137
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,770
think I got the numbers wrong whatever

1138
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:10,869
the detail is our key piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> back you</font>

1139
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:12,400
know up through like draft 03 of the

1140
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:15,430
working group draft had definitions for

1141
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,260
these but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES 56 graft itself wasn't</font>

1142
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,288
ready yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take it out but then</font>

1143
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,859
those rich never got put into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes 56</font>

1144
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:25,210
draft

1145
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:26,230
be sure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just an oversight if</font>

1146
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,329
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Cabo gawak</font>

1147
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,710
automotive them an excellent that's

1148
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:32,289
going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I think that was a</font>

1149
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:34,630
deliberate decision at the time and the

1150
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:37,569
argument for it i recall which may be

1151
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:40,720
very hazy it's a long time ago was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1152
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:43,269
we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce complexity of</font>

1153
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,399
the sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of security options we</font>

1154
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:47,589
need to negotiate and no one had any

1155
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,960
argument for any use case where this was

1156
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,640
better than the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was</font>

1157
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,650
like why at we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1158
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">reduce the comp the implementation</font>

1159
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,880
complexity of having like note by adding

1160
00:57:56,259 --> 00:58:00,400
this registration you're not redoing

1161
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,779
removing the need to do GCM you're just

1162
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,440
adding another thing you have to do as

1163
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:07,599
well right so that's why we removed it

1164
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,009
back then and I I'm still a very solid

1165
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,559
argument today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it at</font>

1166
00:58:09,009 --> 00:58:13,359
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1167
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think it was too because uh</font>

1168
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference to go away it wasn't just like</font>

1169
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:20,739
oh we can make this miss Roth killer

1170
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:22,269
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean certainly I think there was</font>

1171
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:28,329
not the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he do because nobody</font>

1172
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">cares about 192 but um I mean so I read</font>

1173
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:32,980
over the I mean certain i mean i read

1174
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:35,379
the if this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decision it wasn't</font>

1175
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,900
documented anywhere because i read over

1176
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:41,079
the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> archive with from the</font>

1177
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant time period and as none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

1178
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:45,269
decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> made in working group meetings</font>

1179
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:48,249
aren't documented you are correct yes

1180
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:52,180
yeah i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font>

1181
00:58:48,249 --> 00:58:53,799
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was it yeah i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i could see</font>

1182
00:58:52,180 --> 00:59:00,368
if i can find the minutes for that or

1183
00:58:53,799 --> 00:59:02,079
the relevant meetings but um oh let's

1184
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:03,549
hit the root cause here look I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1185
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,769
sympathetic to like what do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1186
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:08,710
convince people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do new stuff so what</font>

1187
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:11,828
was the actual problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> people had in</font>

1188
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of what what what what you said</font>

1189
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:14,710
you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wrote this because some</font>

1190
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:17,649
people didn't want to move to something

1191
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:20,259
be really so know what right now I mean

1192
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,789
you know they have customers who

1193
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:23,980
probably for stupid reasons thinks you

1194
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:25,509
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use aes-256 rather than a it's</font>

1195
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">128</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our circuit because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1196
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:29,499
secure oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the I'm fully on board</font>

1197
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:31,328
with that I know it's it's bigger it's

1198
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,620
better I have a bunch of customers like

1199
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:34,960
yeah and so and so what

1200
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,779
and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1201
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,340
crypto kernels you know don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1202
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,380
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> gah what counter mode in them and</font>

1203
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it's subjective certified so</font>

1204
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,670
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna happen anytime soon so</font>

1205
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,600
basically if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't tell them yeah you</font>

1206
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,250
should great move to teach a lesson

1207
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,140
straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said great I say but it</font>

1208
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:52,330
means either you have to cut back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1209
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:54,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">128-bit keying or move to gamma counter</font>

1210
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,900
mode they say no I think I'll say what

1211
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,759
security description so it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1212
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,980
interesting to understand which crypto

1213
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,100
kernels they're using that don't have

1214
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,600
that that do have it for 256 counter

1215
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,100
mode because that's the one I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1216
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,360
I'm willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe there's something</font>

1217
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,000
out there I'm not aware of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1218
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,080
don't have I went this was a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

1219
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,910
life that's why I upwards of the short

1220
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:27,759
answer is ours ah ok I your pip sitter

1221
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:30,399
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 on it oh I feel your pain and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1222
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:34,540
Lauren<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that makes me more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> positive</font>

1223
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,490
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yes yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other point</font>

1224
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,529
is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Libous rdp actually</font>

1225
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:40,060
implemented these code points because as

1226
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:43,510
far as i can tell nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed that it</font>

1227
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:46,299
got taken out of the draft and so you

1228
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:49,270
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually i submitted a i pull</font>

1229
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,440
request on removing them for the beta

1230
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,490
that's about to come out because they

1231
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,920
said hey wait a second this is never

1232
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:55,629
defined but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought about it that</font>

1233
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:04,060
way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bad idea i should maybe</font>

1234
01:00:55,630 --> 01:01:05,500
just define so the next next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide again</font>

1235
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:08,230
why not what gives you a few cm and the

1236
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,820
answer is you want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy to</font>

1237
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,290
move off of security descriptions and

1238
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:18,340
like I said our crypto colonel doesn't

1239
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:20,170
have you see Evan um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun ok again</font>

1240
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and thoughts that I mean so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

1241
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:26,530
colin is saying you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1242
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:28,270
minimize complexity and you know i

1243
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:30,700
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's said like I said</font>

1244
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:34,720
the lib srtp has had<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the code</font>

1245
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:35,980
for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so probably if you're</font>

1246
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,390
concerned about what Cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> fermentations</font>

1247
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:41,890
will do the problem answers are probably

1248
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:43,480
already doing this I mean I know how

1249
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,379
their new coach I mean it doesn't matter

1250
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,770
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're already in the code or</font>

1251
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,240
whatever

1252
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,980
I know what's negotiate with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1253
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,200
that stuff is we generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> move it out</font>

1254
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,700
of the policy level higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you</font>

1255
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,319
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that what we'd offer and what's</font>

1256
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,029
generating the SDP is different than

1257
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,140
what yeah under all those Ricky last

1258
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:58,120
nothing you have to be anyway because

1259
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:00,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in the yeah it's all in the I'm</font>

1260
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,950
say I'm doing dtls and figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I</font>

1261
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:06,790
mean my preferred path to this would be

1262
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:07,990
to figure out how to get you GCM code I

1263
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:12,310
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would make the world a better</font>

1264
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:15,100
place right um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I mean</font>

1265
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,990
you are if you go down this path you

1266
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,750
still will not have an implementation

1267
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:22,720
that is compliant with dtls srtp rich

1268
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:26,710
requires GCM as<font color="#CCCCCC"> mt I know it doesn't not</font>

1269
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,879
for her to be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean yeah the dtls I get</font>

1270
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:30,790
weird it's a weird situation we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1271
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,520
using that for our we're using different

1272
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,870
crypto kernels for the dtls part than

1273
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,860
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual srp people are so stupid</font>

1274
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:40,210
but it's the way we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say</font>

1275
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:44,020
okay I'm clearly with things so stupid I

1276
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:46,540
don't want to explain them III don't

1277
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,890
know okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a casual</font>

1278
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,570
decision I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this actually</font>

1279
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,100
makes interoperable harder on the long

1280
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,660
term and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I and I on the other hand would</font>

1281
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,799
like to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font>

1282
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,330
things easier from people trying to

1283
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,470
actually build stuff so I don't really

1284
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what we should do with this but I</font>

1285
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:01,870
do not think this is a trivial discesa

1286
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:04,060
and I'm a little I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly sad that</font>

1288
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,009
the time I schedule do they wouldn't

1289
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,149
have thought that would be a conflict

1290
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:11,800
but I wrote this graph yesterday this

1291
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:13,180
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been and that you said that I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't read the dress but I have a</font>

01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment okay give talking about we're</font>

1294
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:20,080
talking about a registration in the dtls

1295
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:22,210
SFTP protection profile right right

1296
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:26,110
right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification required</font>

1297
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:30,310
not not that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true we just had that</font>

1298
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:33,370
discussion earlier yes um that's true

1299
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,650
but that doesn't mean the working group

1300
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:38,020
can't have a consensus yeah feels like

1301
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:40,780
something you know I am you know I i

1302
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,970
would but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet feels like a very weird</font>

1303
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:47,080
thing to do given that you know it's a

1304
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:50,290
you know standards track spec in but

1305
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:53,560
yeah I could just yeah but it that bad

1306
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:55,029
yeah and all the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they</font>

1307
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,009
know given of the expert<font color="#CCCCCC"> avec earth oh</font>

1308
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,630
by the way lacquer would seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1309
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:05,920
enthusiastic seem to be Lisa

1310
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:07,799
so I'm sorry sorry minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> whistlin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1311
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,180
to voice my opinion about this because

1312
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:12,880
she suddenly understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> Callens at the</font>

1313
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,950
same time it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have tons of</font>

1314
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,849
detail as a satrapy protection profiles

1315
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:22,720
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one other 256-bit skied one</font>

1316
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:28,720
and that's das<font color="#CCCCCC"> UCM one and in total</font>

1317
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:33,910
there is currently six registers two of

1318
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:35,319
which are the null cipher you know we

1319
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,240
never did what I didn't you ya know

1320
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:40,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">which we skip 182 entirely with us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font>

1321
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,578
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows useless hey so I I do</font>

1322
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:46,750
think it's it's reasonable thing to

1323
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:50,410
actually register for the SFTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Cypress that we do have a habit ITF</font>

1325

consensus on to actually have it

1326
01:04:52,359 --> 01:05:03,759
possible to negotiate so I'd allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1327
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:07,538
from not having rather drafts I wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1328
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:11,009
yesterday and as understand so when we

1329
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:17,529
make a registry specification required

1330
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:20,319
it's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if someone's using</font>

1331
01:05:17,529 --> 01:05:25,410
crap out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with a consistent number</font>

1332
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:25,410
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number in the registry so</font>

1333
01:05:25,529 --> 01:05:30,339
whether we recommend it for use or not

1334
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a completely different question that</font>

1335
01:05:30,339 --> 01:05:36,400
if someone out there is using this

1336
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:38,710
number or name or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is then in</font>

1337
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,299
any way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form it's better to</font>

1338
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:46,569
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the registry them than to</font>

1339
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:48,400
leave it undocumented mercenary<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1340
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:52,269
just a clear for one thing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Collins</font>

1341
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:55,269
point um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think maybe the reasoning</font>

1342
01:05:52,269 --> 01:05:57,640
would be that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we allow a bunch</font>

1343
01:05:55,269 --> 01:06:00,220
of crap into stp because we we all think

1344
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's crafty anyway and and you know love</font>

1345
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,368
you want to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font>

1346
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:06,230
to something else in the future

1347
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:08,630
we typically don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that philosophy</font>

1348
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:10,400
in dtls and we don't want to pollute

1349
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,170
detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> s with things and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font>

1350
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,029
pushback is that this actually has to go

1351
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,759
into the dtls a certainty you know

1352
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:19,279
profiles you know in those structures

1353
01:06:16,759 --> 01:06:21,289
and so that does add you know crofton to

1354
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:24,259
dt allows something we don't expect to

1355
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:27,049
replace something we don't want to grow

1356
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:29,749
absurdly complex like STP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there</font>

1357
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:31,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there between allowing a</font>

1358
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">spec to go forward in sdp versus</font>

1359
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:41,299
allowing it to go forward in dtls fatal

1360
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:43,099
structures this is ben again did I hear

1361
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:46,069
you correctly at the beginning of the

1362
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:47,569
discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to enable people</font>

1363
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:50,058
who are currently you think security

1364
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:53,359
descriptions to moving to dtls srtp and

1365
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:57,200
if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this they won't um it's</font>

1366
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:58,670
or at least it's III mean won't is a

1367
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,220
strong word but I have to argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1368
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:03,769
them a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know this helps</font>

1369
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:06,680
enable that yes so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say we</font>

1370
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:08,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a competition of arms here and and</font>

1371
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,549
which do we hate them which one would

1372
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:13,059
you rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the people moving to</font>

1373
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:15,890
using dtl FFX be worth of keeping the

1374
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:20,239
registry clean I mean I certainly not

1375
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:21,769
which what I would prefer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

1376
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">said I'm still not convinced that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1377
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:34,430
know I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> history on</font>

1378
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:36,739
Collins point about 56 cuz I just want

1379
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to highlight look I'm I don't know what</font>

1380
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:40,609
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this anymore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay um</font>

1381
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:44,210
because all good points made it too much

1382
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:46,069
okay um but I do worry that let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1383
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:48,140
go down this path and these people do

1384
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:50,749
exactly what you're proposing here we

1385
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,670
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just created dtls srtp your</font>

1386
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:54,169
implementation will not interoperate

1387
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,239
with our implementation and that sounds

1388
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,440
like a failure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF and I'm not</font>

1389
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means you're showing the one</font>

1390
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,440
code point I meaning the problem is you

1391
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,999
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a detail SSR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1392
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,430

01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:07,519
MTI ciphers witching which has<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one</font>

1394
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:10,069

compliant detail SS department no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1396
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:15,109
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the client is why differ okay</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i may be wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the RFC's maybe but</font>

1398
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:18,219
you have to do that to have it

1399
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:20,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">verbal implementation what is the fax</font>

1401
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:26,139
see ya oh it definitely does you know I

01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:27,460
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the underlying dtls SR one</font>

01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:31,270
of the other ones does as well actually

1404
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:33,009
I'm not positive on but anyway it

1405
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,719
doesn't matter the point is the path

1406
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:36,520
you're taking us down leads to non

1407
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,339
interoperability which was exactly the

1408
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:45,759
reason I originally we didn't go down

1409
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:49,059
this path right yeah my name is Weston I

1410
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:54,009
think I mean detail s si Capitano

1411
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:59,770
required to implement the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn.1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tate</font>

1412
01:08:54,009 --> 01:09:01,299
bitch no no it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy I know then if</font>

1413
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:04,179
you think is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there must be some</font>

1414
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:07,689
updated details yes the detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect</font>

1415
01:09:04,179 --> 01:09:09,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that may require the same but the detail</font>

1416
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSH v-spec only requires you to have</font>

1417
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:22,238
hunt wait date the counter mode how to

1418
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,830
love the strong i have now unheard two

1419
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,009
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are completely inconsistent</font>

1420
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:30,100
in my mind one is that the registry is

1421
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:33,100
specification acquired the other thing

1422
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:34,870
from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> curtain is that putting more</font>

1423
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,799
stuff in the Jag astray will destroy

1424
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:41,920
interoperability that's what I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1425
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">say Harold I'm not arguing that in the</font>

1426
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,460
slightest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agreed with all the comments</font>

1427
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:48,940
are made up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm saying that</font>

1428
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the argument to do this that the</font>

1429
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:53,408
proposal you're doing for adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort</font>

1430
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:54,969
of thing right you know I find a

1431
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:58,449
motivational it's good maybe we should

1432
01:09:54,969 --> 01:10:00,699
just go do it but I'm I'm not talking

1433
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:02,110
about the iono registration

1434
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:04,089
process that doesn't matter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1435
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:06,070
irrelevant here right the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1436
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:09,219
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what trying path do we try and</font>

1437
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:10,920
encourage implementers to go down to get

1438
01:10:09,219 --> 01:10:15,670
us to what we're trying to accomplish

1439
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:17,739
right and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original argument why</font>

1440
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,110
we took removed a whole bunch of

1441
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:22,269
profiles was we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were</font>

1442
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:24,219
actually causing things to be harder for

1443
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:26,530
implementers not easier for implementers

1444
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:28,570
and he is you know is that the case here

1445
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:30,320
or not it's hard sell I don't know I'm

1446
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:32,150
like I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not objecting to this draft</font>

1447
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,009
I don't know what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1448
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:36,710
brought up through why we got here I'm

1449
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:39,080
certainly not arguing Mindy I mean if

1450
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:40,700
you you have a dry you can go request

1451
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,700
this in the registry tomorrow it'll be

1452
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:46,490
in there right I mean come out they

1453
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:47,720
doing that ID but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1454
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:49,160
specification in the form<font color="#CCCCCC"> of draft</font>

1455
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,890
that's a specification as far as I'm

1456
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:55,160
concerned so and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it in the</font>

1457
01:10:51,890 --> 01:11:03,770
registry with no input from this working

1458
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:08,420
group now I understand thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1459
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:13,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure what the best way forward is</font>

1460
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:14,810
I mean I could do it as a I mean I could

1461
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:17,120
do it as a pure specification require

1462
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:21,280
but I still feel odd about this or

1463
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,280
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feel that you know for a</font>

1464
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:30,700
a crypto you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our PP spec</font>

1465
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:46,310
which is itself an ietf satyrs track so

1466
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not 80 advice known even I think</font>

1467
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:50,650
you you should pollute it and register

1468
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:53,179
it here among its I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1469
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:55,339
argument about inter probability because

1470
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:57,040
the interoperability is not as in this

1471
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,410
but inter bilities in the

1472
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,360
implementations and and both the RTC

1473
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:05,090
weapon I had to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also include EP</font>

1474
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:07,610
mapping to specify what is what it must

1475
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,680
be supported right yeah nothing anybody

1476
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:13,040
is recommending making this an empty I

1477
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:16,340
of anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and and it's a where it's</font>

1478
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,200
made mpi is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the Indies in these</font>

1479
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:21,410
specific documents because it is in the

1480
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,179
clue in the RTC web and include because

1481
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:28,790
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not see web I got a comment</font>

1482
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:36,440
from in the IPF you that the tits needs

1483
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:39,320
to have we need to specify one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cullen if</font>

1484
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,759
we were to would you accept being in the

1485
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:43,940
rough if we decided to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

1486
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:46,160
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your item now yeah for sure</font>

1487
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:47,839
I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as I said I don't even</font>

1488
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,639
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am in the rough I just like</font>

1489
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,340
and will certainly try to consult with

1490
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,690
you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in general like a</font>

1491
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:55,070
plot thank you for bringing it and

1492
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:56,480
considering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you do versus just</font>

1493
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,860
going in filing out how you could have

1494
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">right you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use process to act</font>

1495
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:02,449
this but me let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like obviously</font>

1496
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,739
the bets think about what's the best

1497
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing we can do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys get to</font>

1498
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:06,650
it in a robber okay yeah sure right

1499
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:10,100
overall I have no problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1500
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:11,870
the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristen I</font>

1501
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">would make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another comment i think is</font>

1502
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:15,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">really should go to the list etc and</font>

1503
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:17,960
maybe you should go talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

1504
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:19,790
people's not here<font color="#CCCCCC"> by karen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geez I've</font>

1505
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,130
talked to some of the people offline I

1506
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:24,769
mean both Martin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker seemed like</font>

1507
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:26,600
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with it but I mean yeah</font>

1508
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:36,500
because eating at this big currently

1509
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:37,910
head running against us it's yeah i'm

1510
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take back my statement merely</font>

1511
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:42,620
go about having no particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad advice</font>

1512
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will point out that making this a</font>

1513
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,370
working group by them takes working

1514
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">group resources a time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1515
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can be done a specification</font>

1516
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:53,389
required so getting the advice of the

1517
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:55,100
working group is perfectly fine going

1518
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:56,719
through the glass call process and all

1519
01:13:55,100 --> 01:14:02,210
that sort of thing is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> overkill</font>

1520
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:04,040
I you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really think this</font>

1521
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:08,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a problem that we need to relook at</font>

1522
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:13,280
the registration policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so maybe</font>

1523
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:14,540
what maybe I should just talk to Diana

1524
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,860
and figure out what they watch you want

1525
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,630
for specification for this kind of

1526
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:20,150
situation require because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ID</font>

1527
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:27,090
would not be sufficient I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

1528
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:31,269
it is an expiring document<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah hey</font>

1529
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:37,740
we can I ask what the side conversation

1530
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:41,140
it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting apparently not</font>

1531
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,639
Magnus can you we're curious what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1532
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:45,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what were you saying it sounds</font>

1533
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,110
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so sorry I'm yeah I</font>

1534
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it's specifically required you</font>

1535
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:52,299
still need the specification that

1536
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:55,270
normally meets we prefer specifications

1537
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,250
from some type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sto right which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

1538
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:59,680
that yeah Bassam agree you need to get

1539
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,150
it proved somewhere written up and

1540
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,950
approved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a stable</font>

1541
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">permanent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference that's together I</font>

1542
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:05,559
