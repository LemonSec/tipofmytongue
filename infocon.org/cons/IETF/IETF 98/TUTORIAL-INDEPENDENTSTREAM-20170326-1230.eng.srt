00:00:48,370 --> 00:01:01,790
hmm i guess my watch is is it's about

3
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:04,399
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the small but</font>

4
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,259
select company presents the ones who

5
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:10,580
come along to find out about the

6
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:14,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">independent stream and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm told that</font>

7
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:17,390
this gets recorded and the slides will

8
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:21,050
be available so lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can catch</font>

9
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:24,020
up on it later so I'm never<font color="#CCCCCC"> bromley I'm</font>

10
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,580
the independent submissions editor and

11
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,170
I've been the independent submissions

12
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:34,700
who didn't for quite a long what seems

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:39,080
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very long time now um but the</font>

14
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,330
stream has been through a period where

15
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,030
there were lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> submissions coming in</font>

16
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,110
and that was fine but over the last

17
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,349
little while they fallen off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it</font>

18
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,470
seemed it's high time I put a bit of

19
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:55,940
effort into making sure that people

20
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:00,879
really knew what the stream was all

21
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:03,378
about so I'll put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide set</font>

22
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:10,099
we'll talk about about the history of

23
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:13,670
the screen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> about of the ROC but they</font>

24
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:15,440
are assessing I mustn't say series at

25
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,660
this point because it wasn't a series in

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,859
the beginning all about the history of

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,500
the RSC's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent stream and I'm</font>

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,440
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that weird abbreviation i nst</font>

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,730
because one of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who proof read</font>

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,010
these slides for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem like is as a</font>

31
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,260
abbreviation for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion screen um</font>

32
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,179
so that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stream how it came</font>

33
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:45,200
about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else in your world</font>

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:48,620
of the ITF there are rfcs which describe

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,339
how things are supposed to work or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 466</font>

36
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,410
powerful right

37
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,930
but getting into the practical side of

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">it there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the question what kind of</font>

39
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,769
things does the stream actually publish

40
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,390
look at that in a bit more detail and

41
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,489
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful for</font>

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,839
you to know a little more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

43
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:14,250
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> process what Howard how I make it</font>

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">all work so that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda slide if</font>

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you like so we start by having a look at</font>

46
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:25,560
the early history of the rfcs RFC either

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,140
the Volusion one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these go back they</font>

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,099
go back a very long time they go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,048
the up in it project and in april of

50
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,790
nineteen sixty-nine Steve Crocker

51
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,680
published the first such document David

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,959
a number well it's the first document

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,780
naturally it was our FC one and in the

54
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,120
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> stages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the upper neck the RFC's</font>

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,069
really were request for comments they

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,930
were information about whatever the

57
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:59,819
group is working on shared among the

58
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,440
people working in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

59
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,819
wasn't too long before they realized

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,579
well actually there's a growing number

61
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,880
of these we need to allocate the numbers

62
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,519
and we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> after those and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,950
point where jon postel what his hand up

64
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,108
and said I'll do that it was a really

65
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,139
very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> group back then so he became</font>

66
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,099
the keeper of the numbers and all the

67
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,810
documents were allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers over</font>

68
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:27,060
there weren't originally RFC's they were

69
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,729
engineered engineering notes which

70
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,099
didn't happen it people he used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

71
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:37,650
track of what they were doing but jon

72
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:40,969
postel gave them RFC numbers and so that

73
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the big very beginning but then a</font>

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:49,530
few years later in 1986 quite a few

75
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">years later actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 1986 the ITF got</font>

76
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:56,609
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was the point where the</font>

77
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:00,060
up and it had given what even<font color="#CCCCCC"> way a</font>

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,550
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and lots more</font>

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,539
people were starting to access and use

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,300
internet

81
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:11,740
so the 80th then what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was set up as a</font>

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:18,039
task force in 1986 and back then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:22,180
reported to the IAB so the IAB basically

84
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:27,539
appointed the I eat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iesg and looked</font>

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:32,650
after everything to do with the idea and

86
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:34,469
it stayed like that for 86 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 92</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

87
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,359
can see I've been getting a lot of

88
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:43,120
expert help in country rediscovering

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,060
this early history from 1992 that's when

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the iesg structure was well defined then</font>

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,580
the iesg started to decide exactly how

92
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,110
they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle documents I</font>

93
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,849
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to look after the</font>

94
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:02,770
working groups and so on and up to that

95
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:06,340
point the ROC editor existed as a

96
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,580
separate entity whose job it was to edit

97
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and publish RFC so that was the reality</font>

98
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:18,729
of it was it was a small team of people

99
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:22,870
at ISI and who looked after the idea the

100
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:25,479
rfcs so from the very beginning until

101
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,590
nineteen ninety-eight a little bit later

102
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:31,508
still jon postel was the editor so

103
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,960
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg said write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

104
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,319
document is ready to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> John would take</font>

105
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,739
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it and do whatever needed</font>

106
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,830
way of editing and go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and publish</font>

107
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,750
it put it up on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website and that's</font>

108
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,900
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things which distinguishes</font>

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,349
the RFC's and the IETF from many other

110
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,500
standards organizations the RFC's have

111
00:06:53,349 --> 00:07:04,020
always been publicly available free to

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:06,849
everyone early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on John was assisted by</font>

113
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,490
Joyce Reynolds so she is the other

114
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,370
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who everybody thinks of as one of</font>

115
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,780
the what as the RFC editor from the

116
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:19,600
beginning the thing about John

117
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:23,219
I only ever meet him myself once but

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,660
everybody says about them he was a a

119
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,000
determined prison he believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

120
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,970
text was the important thing and making

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,400
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was clean easily readable</font>

122
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,880
and understandable was the most

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:41,260
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I summarized that he</font>

124
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,210
exercised strong editorial control John

125
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,919
didn't like it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't get published</font>

126
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:53,979
basically but what I'm getting here of

127
00:07:47,919 --> 00:08:00,969
myself there so until the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF got</font>

128
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:02,740
started 1986 all the RFC's a lot of

129
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,860
those which were generated inside the

130
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,680
egg and I TF were independent

131
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,650
submissions<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other words anybody who</font>

132
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,130
wanted your head material they wanted to

133
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,880
get out in front of the internet

134
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:21,250
internet community could send a document

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,530
to John and if you like that he would

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,990
publish it it didn't like it well you

137
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,380
wouldn't and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it coming back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

138
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">the strong editorial control so that's</font>

139
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:37,809
beginnings but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not watch every word you</font>

140
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:41,320
keep an eye on the time so things

141
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:44,739
continued about like that until about

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,830
the middle of the 2000s and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

143
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,800
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the number of</font>

144
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,880
documents being sent across to the RFC

145
00:08:50,800 --> 00:09:00,670
editor got bigger and bigger and so read

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:05,470
about that stage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAB stepped up to</font>

147
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:10,120

149
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,960
they set up well they took what had been

the oh it's either door and split it

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,730
and what they meant by our document

those to us in the RFC world at the

moment are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of documents about</font>

the new formats it's taken us coming on

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,400
for years now to get to that and with

188
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,010
any luck we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will start to see documents</font>

appearing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new formats maybe not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this year but certainly next year that's</font>

191
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way of it yeah well alright okay</font>

192
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,649
then as the IRT if the internet research

193
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">task force</font>

194
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:51,899
they have a bunch of research groups and

195
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:55,829
that particular distinction was made

196
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:59,579
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me a long time ago now I was</font>

197
00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:01,589
working on a working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ASD</font>

198
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,819
decided some of the things that working

199
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:09,269
group is doing are some understood well

200
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:11,099
enough to be put into focus but there's

201
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,110
quite a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them which really are not</font>

202
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,480
well enough to find we see those as

203
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,279
still being research work so we're going

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:24,990
to push<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part of the work into the</font>

205
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">irt year so and the various the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOUs RTF</font>

206
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,470
work is divided into a set of different

207
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">their research groups somewhat similar</font>

208
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,790
to IT working groups the one I'm most

209
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:40,769
familiar with these days is the

210
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:45,300
cryptography research group which has a

211
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:48,089
very act of mailing list so anyway when

212
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,949
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> i arted winner and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a research group</font>

213
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,689
has considered some documents and

214
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:56,069
decided yes we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see these</font>

215
00:12:51,689 --> 00:13:00,209
published as overseas then I think there

216
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:04,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an I our SG but essentially the chair</font>

217
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,969
of the IRT as the stream manager says<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

218
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">pirg of us collectively published and</font>

219
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,589
passes it to the production<font color="#E5E5E5"> center and</font>

220
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:14,519
the last of the streams is the

221
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:16,559
independent screen which continues to do

222
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,730
exactly what John Castell agrees to do

223
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:25,800
to provide a venue for anything up not

224
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,569
covered by the other streams so in

225
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,709
putting these slides together I had a

226
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:33,809
look through and just basically using my

227
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:36,239
favorite search engine to find out about

228
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,740
the independent screen thinking there's

229
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,749
got to be some material that's been

230
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:47,160
written down<font color="#E5E5E5"> already and at the time</font>

231
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:48,929
then the transition is made so that the

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,370
independent stream was set up as a

233
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:55,889
separate screen bisley<font color="#CCCCCC"> daigle and wrote</font>

235
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:01,639

all those years before into the way it

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now and there were a couple of quotes</font>

240
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,329
in Man which I thought were worth

241

putting on the slide one from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> indan</font>

243
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,350
is if you ask people what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

244
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:28,649
RFC series is you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety of</font>

245
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,449
opinions from people who think that only

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:35,399

got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth saying along the</font>

thing about it what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,730
somebody to look after it that's the

274
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,370
independent submissions editor he does

275
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,220
have a job description which is defined

293
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,180
when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally approached I was</font>

294
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,630
led to believe that there wasn't much

295
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:12,600
work in it that maybe like two documents

296
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,270
per month would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in didn't work out</font>

297
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:22,819
that way fortunately I have a very

what happened there was Bob<font color="#E5E5E5"> Braden who</font>

was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC editor at the point of the</font>

current documents off you go oh and by

310
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:04,620
the way I have a editorial board who you

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,860
can turn to when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need help and all</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> members of that us I require all but</font>

313
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,310
very nearly all of those that people are

314
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,800
still looking so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a group of</font>

316

318
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,738
well

319
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,989
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I've said quite</font>

320
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:29,779
often over over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last seven years is</font>

321
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:34,429
if I need help I'll ants court well they

322
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:36,830
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I go to a struggle so now</font>

323
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:42,710
we can look at the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of the</font>

324
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:48,918
stream 4846 defines spells out in detail

325
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:51,049
how it's all supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear so now let</font>

326
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:55,850
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> think do I have to say anything more</font>

327
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:59,149
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> destroyers then there i reproduced</font>

328
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,119
the abstract from 4846 there because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

329
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:05,178
thought it's quite a nice summary of

330
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:10,609
exactly what the stream is supposed to

331
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:13,279
do and to publish materials that are not

332
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:16,189
rooted in the ietf standards process and

333
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,970
its review and approval mechanisms which

334
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:24,220
is code for saying not under any

335
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:26,989
particular influenced by the iesg<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

336
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,169
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you say</font>

337
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:32,299
more about that but next question and

338
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is one which people do tend to ask</font>

339
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:39,830
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just exactly how independent</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure of that the iesg may tell</font>

345
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,879
the independent submission editor that

346
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:08,980
all we'd really much rather you didn't

347
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:12,889
publish such and such a document but the

351
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:26,570
definitely about go ahead and publish

352
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:30,979
anything but in return for that that the

353
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:35,149
Talmud for the 4846 was written the

354

<font color="#CCCCCC">authors agreed that every document which</font>

look at the documents go through the

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:57,830
things they don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can write an</font>

could refuse to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I've never</font>

364
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">done that or they may suggest other</font>

modifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the document and that</font>

366
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:18,080
does mean as far as the is concerned

367
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:19,639
well that's an extra set of eyes who at

368
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,939
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick look edit the</font>

369
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,949
document it goes by so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one not all that</font>

370
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,570
often they've got lots of other

371
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,809
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're worried about but</font>

from time to time one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other of the</font>

area directors will suggest helpful

changes to the document so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

375
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:44,149
last point of reviews for me as far as

376
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:46,699
the in extreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concern so the next</font>

377
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,228
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

378
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,619
independent stream is supposed to be all

379
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:55,279
about now what sort of RFC's can it

380
00:21:51,619 --> 00:22:00,379
published well 4846 is pretty definite

381
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:03,679
about that the stream can publish

382
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:07,609
informational experimental or historic

383
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,109
documents that may certainly not publish

384
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,379
anything that looks anything like a

385
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:17,779
standard strike document because

386
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:21,049
standard state documents require an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATF</font>

387
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:24,619
community consensus the ITF is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

388
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">consensus driven organization so it</font>

389
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:31,099
standards documents reflect that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

390
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:35,269
consensus as compared to that the

391
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:39,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">independent stream RFC's they get two or</font>

392
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:42,859
three or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four sometimes five reviews</font>

393
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:46,359
independent reviews but they don't

394
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,359
represent any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus</font>

395
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:54,279
so what kind of material works what is

396
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,908
most suitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the independence trip</font>

397
00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:01,209
well I've lost three category categories

398
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:04,029
here these are this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my experience of</font>

399
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:06,939
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years the first is work</font>

400
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,349
which just doesn't fit within another

401
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:12,309
stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something which didn't done</font>

402
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,928
but there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> no working group</font>

403
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in it there was no research</font>

404
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:18,489
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in it no a bee</font>

405
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,289
certainly weren't interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it okay</font>

406
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:24,129
then it's a candidate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infinite</font>

407
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:28,658
stream and some examples of things like

408
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:30,819
that well I published a document about

409
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,669
Ed Rome and as far as I know it's the

410
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:36,789
only published documentation to eat your

411
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:40,659
own and how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years</font>

412
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and then live so that's one nice</font>

413
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:49,419
example then there are vent or developed

414
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:53,139
systems and the one that's comes to mind

415
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:55,989
is e I grp that's a cisco specific

416
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:58,629
routing protocol suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco have been</font>

417
00:23:55,989 --> 00:24:00,849
putting it in mirror artists<font color="#E5E5E5"> for as long</font>

418
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:05,799
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can remember certainly back into</font>

419
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:07,299
the early 90s but it was it was starting

420
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,339
with it through a one or two academic

421
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,849
articles about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but there was no other</font>

422
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:18,149
real documentation everybody just used

423
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:21,399
it and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just worked so i had a bet a</font>

424
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:24,879
rather long document<font color="#CCCCCC"> and spelling out in</font>

425
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:26,468
great detail exactly hard work and that

426
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:28,928
was a nice accommodation for the

427
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:31,589
infinite stream it's a bit late now for

428
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:35,349
the help of lyric doing independent

429
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:38,889
implementations of eigrp but should they

430
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:42,658
want to and now they can and there are

431
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:47,519
quite a number of other kind of specific

432
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:50,289
systems where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've published documents</font>

433
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,199
so that other people from implement it

434
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,619
and use it then there are historic

435
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:58,820
documents and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have one really</font>

436
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:01,459
good example there

437
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,370
somebody who sent me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

ARPANET<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emmanuel don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look that</font>

439
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:12,918
one up on Wikipedia if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

440
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,689
more about that but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had taken the</font>

441
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:19,159
trouble to take the original paper copy

442
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:23,240
which he had and turn it into a minute

443
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft and so there is a truly historic</font>

444
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,049
document nicely sitting with from the

445
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,870
independent stream so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

446
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:38,929
modernen doesn't fit in another stream

447
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:41,209
class the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is work which might</font>

448
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:44,840
well fit into one of the other streams

449
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,649
but that stream doesn't want it so this

450
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:52,699
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where a bunch of authors</font>

451
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:55,820
have tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get their ideas to take</font>

group cheers and said look we're

454
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,639
terribly sorry but we've got so much

455

that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get through we are</font>

458
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:14,570

459
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:18,350
get an era see published was to support

<font color="#E5E5E5">a request to I enna for a code point in</font>

some specification required<font color="#E5E5E5"> register and</font>

462
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,889
there are quite a lot of those documents

463
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:30,590
that have gone through independence

464
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:31,969
three in the last seven years some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

465
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:37,158
them can actually be quite tricky

466
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:40,789
because well because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to take</font>

467
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:44,179
their requests to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna and work out</font>

468
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:48,230
exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's needed I unasked</font>

469
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:50,360
to find an expert<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the subject it to</font>

470
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,240
review that request and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

471
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,549
can be quite quite tricky but it's

472
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,529
something which doesn't need an ietf

473
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:02,320
consensus so it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through the</font>

474
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:04,639
independent stream know once you have

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've jumped the gun on the bottom bullet</font>

477
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:12,149
but is already deployed out in the

478
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,780
internet and being used

479
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:18,870
widely used so an example of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

480
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:23,430
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Denmark for email</font>

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,570
technologies that certainly hadn't been

484
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,629
developed in or we can grip but it's out

485
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,510
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's widely used and so if it's</font>

486
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:44,540
documented in an RFC other people can

487
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:46,560
implement it and use it now what about

488
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:50,240
anime is going on with other things

489
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">these ones are the categories from 4846</font>

490
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah that's better these are the ones</font>

491
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">4836 and the the outer level bullets are</font>

492
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:10,830
from 4846 critical reviews of IDT for

493
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:14,190
other technical word well as an example

494
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:16,470
of that I had a submission which was

495
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,910
documenting the discussions inside a

496
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:23,610
working group where they've been

497
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:25,740
developing a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol on my</font>

498
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,000
reviewers said well it's it's good and

499
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,010
it deserves to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be published it would</font>

500
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,670
have been even better if they've gone on

501
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:36,620
to discuss the other parts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> chef</font>

502
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:41,420
developed after their that particular

503
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,419
standard was published about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind</font>

504
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:50,910
other now the key to this one is

505
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical work if it's not technical if</font>

506
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,190
it's just commenting on i-80 processes

507
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,800
particularly then it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

508
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">with which the IAC considers really</font>

509
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,350
important if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be published</font>

510
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:09,750
as an RFC in seven years there's only

511
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:11,730
been one goes the other possibility or

512
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,460
next possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> re publication of</font>

513
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">standards developed by other bodies now</font>

514
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,160
we have done that the time and time to

515
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:25,679
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not within my time this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is e</font>

516
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:30,540
and 4846 has still other

517
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,960
bilities and even then the list is not

518
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:37,139
not at all it's also the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

519
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:41,190
the IAC wants to publish it citizen

520
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,650
worth publishing them with candy but

521
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,980
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I'm in that list which</font>

522
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,920
I thought was interesting it includes

523
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:55,470
eulogies and there's a reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> theater</font>

524
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:59,010
RFC 2441 John<font color="#CCCCCC"> Costello John died I was</font>

525
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:03,390
very unexpectedly in 1998<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a big</font>

526
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:07,230
loss to everybody and<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF</font>

527
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:11,280
community so that particular RFC is a

528
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:13,470
really nice eulogy to them and it gives

529
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,450
you a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea what's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

531
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:24,740
directly now moving on<font color="#E5E5E5"> from history at</font>

532
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:29,100
last so you're going to submit them

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,930
independent stream a document<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">minimal requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well it has to</font>

537
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:47,780
anything but logically it should be a

538
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:51,660
technology related topic and if that's

539
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">better if it's well supported by the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">authors being able to say we know of</font>

00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:01,080
several implementations of this and we

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:04,530
know that it's out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used I do</font>

543
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:09,379
get the submissions of people who are

544
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:12,060
dreaming up wonderful new things but

545
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,820
certainly not publishing any more ideas

546
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:21,409
of how to improve IP version 4 for

547
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:24,750
example so existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementations and</font>

548
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:28,880
some deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> are both really good</font>

549
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:33,260
things to support for submission next

550
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,260
the topic has to be something that would

551
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,080
not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which was more suitable</font>

elsewhere

553
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,649
so the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> places where it might be</font>

554
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,920
coerced well any other standards

00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,770
organization like its receiver to work

556
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:53,650
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> web consortium BB if the broadband</font>

558
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,000
shouldn't read like a standard which

means it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really can't use words</font>

formal session go ahead

567
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:24,879
well the poor on the slide only sees

568
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:28,889
should not leave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a standard so</font>

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,889
that's not of knowledge show stopper<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

570
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:53,830
send it in and I don't think so but send

571
00:33:47,500 --> 00:34:04,929
it in and we'll think about it from

572
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:06,908
other you congratulations oh well I

573
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:09,609
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what again yes this Hydra</font>

doesn't matter it should not trying to

look like an hour iata<font color="#CCCCCC"> stamp yes exactly</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">so you know the I independent stream has</font>

579
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:35,529
its own boilerplate for rfcs as an

580
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:37,179
example have a look at 75 93 which is

the injury if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own one that should</font>

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:46,030
will that's an easier place to find it

583
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:49,290
then anywhere else this may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

584
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:52,389
if you thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were looking for some</font>

586
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,490
from it being an IRC well it doesn't

<font color="#CCCCCC">have it come from independent streams if</font>

588
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,450
you have worries about your your

590
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,490
post it as an intimate draft and if you

00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,430
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make an IPR</font>

592

the ITF can do for it remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of</font>

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:24,730
us allow it but there were having said

595
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:31,828
that the ITF at the our policy does

596
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:35,160
apply to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet drafts and usually</font>

597
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:39,700
independent submissions are posted as

00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:42,250
internet-drafts so if you if you're

599
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:47,049
worried about that then that's what you

600
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:49,720
do to actually make a submission<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

601
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:55,650
post your document isn't it in a draft

name of the draft I need to know what

618
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:47,740
status it's going to be before I have to

619
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:50,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look at it and read it up and I</font>

620
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know whether this document has</font>

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,470
its background and partly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

625
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:07,200
gives me clues as to who I might be able

626
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to approach to review that document</font>

627
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:17,190
then if you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I Anna code</font>

628
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:20,790
points I need to know that this draft is

629
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:24,140
one which doesn't require<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF consensus</font>

630
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:30,029
or standards action and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> atop</font>

631
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:34,379
5226 tells you about that specification

632
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:38,670
required of the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vienna coke once</font>

633
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,290
which the screen can handle statement of

634
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,910
purpose of publishing the document why

635
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:46,740
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this document should be</font>

636
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:49,830
published just having it as an RFC isn't

637
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,270
a good reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to know what sort</font>

638
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of audience are aiming at them who you</font>

639
00:37:51,270 --> 00:38:00,109
hope will read and the page asks for

640
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:03,240
suggestions of component independent

641
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:07,980
potential reviewers for the document now

642
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:10,049
the IAC can and will find reviewers but

643
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,470
if you can give me a few names to start

644
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:20,970
with that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very healthy I don't know</font>

645
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:22,919
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself that's assuming of</font>

646
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,589
course that I decide to go ahead with

647
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,099
the document but given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I accepted</font>

648
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:32,759
into the stream then I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out</font>

649
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and find at least two reviewers I can</font>

650
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:40,140
ask almost anybody including the IETF

651
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,790
leadership so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can ask your either</font>

652
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,529
because I can ask quickly good<font color="#E5E5E5"> chairs</font>

653
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:50,250
and when I do the request is tactically

654
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:52,619
set as could you review this better what

655
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:57,859
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you suggest likely</font>

656
00:38:52,619 --> 00:39:01,290
reviewers so I it hasn't been that

657
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:04,290
impossibly hard to find reviews for

658
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:06,720
documents I normally ask them for too

659
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,220
just give me a brief heads up on do you

660
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,250
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is worth while duckin me or</font>

661
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,129
not so if they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they think</font>

662
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,990
oh gosh not another like that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

663
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:19,320
me that and not waste any more of their

664
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:21,779
time mine just means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to go</font>

665
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:26,490
looking for other reviewers but if they

666
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:28,340
accept that then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a</font>

667
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,080
review back to the inside three weeks

668
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,450
after about two and a half weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I seem</font>

669
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plodding email and we go on from</font>

670
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:42,509
there but everybody involved in the ITF

671
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:45,990
is busy with their day jobs and so three

672
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:47,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks many of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of pretty good</font>

673
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,819
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes it takes longer</font>

674
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:54,150
and if they can't do a denial central

675
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:59,270
other rivers and of the last point of

676
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:04,470
view of reviewing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> G get to do a</font>

677
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:08,580
conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you a57</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC 5742</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

678
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:10,950
what will go on to that people who

679
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,910
haven't written reviews for me before

680
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:17,640
ask what should the review look like

681
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,740
that's involved in doing this so i write

682
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,129
down some guidelines for them so the

683
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,390
first one is is it technically sound

684
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:27,000
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look as though it could be</font>

685
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:28,830
implemented if the you can see the

686
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,530
reviewer can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things which need to be</font>

687
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:34,770
changed or which would cause problems

688
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:37,200
were implemented and deployed then we

689
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the authors can</font>

690
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,759
sort those out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is very like</font>

691
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,500
again what happens with comments and a

692
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,620
working group if this particular

693
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,930
document is describing a protocol then

694
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:55,710
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question as a working group is</font>

695
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:59,720
there enough detail to let somebody

696
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:04,770
implement somebody else implement this

697
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:10,770
from the text and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to</font>

698
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:15,090
jon postel an example code or it is not

699
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough sometimes that's all there is and</font>

700
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,740
sometimes well<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind it's like only</font>

701
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:25,650
hood you have to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> implement</font>

702
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:29,879
from the text and are all the required

703
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:32,640
sections of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they're like</font>

704
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're supposed to so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">inr consider</font>

706
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,010
section which I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing is</font>

707
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,510
required or spells out what is required

708
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:45,720
there has to be security considerations

709
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:50,760
because without those but it just can't

710
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:54,870
go any further so when in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> high AC</font>

711
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,630
has got some reviews back he sends

712
00:41:54,870 --> 00:42:01,020
copies of those to the draft authors you

713
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,970
may also send suggestions and requests

714
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:07,500
improvements to be made before we can

715
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:11,160
get any further with the graph and as

716
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,370
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their unlike paper being</font>

you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who the reviewer is most</font>

emails and healthy authors make the

changes so that we could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in really</font>

722
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,940
good shape before trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go any</font>

723
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:37,190
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the authors have made the</font>

724
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,570
changes and the reviewers<font color="#CCCCCC"> envia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISE</font>

725
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:44,370
happy that the document is ready to go

726
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:48,510
further then last<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase last hurdle to</font>

727
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:57,600
jump the IAC asks the iesg for their

728
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:59,520
conflict review 5742 now early on nobody

729
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,210
was clear exactly what information the

730
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,850
Iast would like to see so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I simply sent</font>

731
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,620
a note to say well here's the diode is

732
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,259
the abstract of it said you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

733
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,500
it's about this is a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

734
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:18,410
who reviewed it for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> played</font>

735
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:21,390
and I agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fine overview and</font>

736
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,069
they came back to say oh but we're not

737
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,589
quite sure that we trust those reviewers

738
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:28,200
or we don't know those reviewers

739
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:32,190
particularly or it will generally not

740
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,560
happy we need more information so I've

741
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,720
reached a point now of writing things up

742
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them so I give him the abstract</font>

743
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,500
brief history of where the draft came

744
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:46,598
from how it was developed comments if

745
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,099
any are needed on what the I immigrants

746
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,509
relations or security considerations

747
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:56,890
might be a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reviewers and</font>

748
00:43:51,509 --> 00:44:00,220
copies of the reviews usually now that's

749
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:05,440
because 4846 says that reviews will be

750
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">published so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's part of the iat</font>

751
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,930
community that everything is done in

752
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,489
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this independent stream</font>

753
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,940
there doesn't have to be consensus but

754
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:20,979
the reviews are published usually with

755
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:23,289
the reviewers names but if you're

756
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:28,118
reviewing and this does happen sometimes

757
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:29,559
we're having work it happens where

758
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,289
people working in a company has said

759
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">that my bosses please don't please make</font>

760
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:41,470
this an armed and anonymous review well

761
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:46,538
we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but they've let start</font>

762
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:51,009
works right so when everything is set

763
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:55,390
the offer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he sends it to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg they</font>

764
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:57,039
have a look at the draft 5742 they may

765
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions in which patients they</font>

766
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,259
will swap email with the IAC or with the

767
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,989
authors and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point that</font>

768
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:06,819
they may pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things which</font>

769
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely as mr. well then they think</font>

770
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:11,229
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> little changes which would</font>

771
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:15,569
improve it that's fine and then they

772
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:15,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">send back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ISE a recommendation</font>

773
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:22,299
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the independent</font>

774
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,549
submissions editorial board were very

775
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:28,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">very helpful in reviewing these slides</font>

776
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:33,788
through about six iterations to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get all</font>

777
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:36,579
of us spelled out clearly so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IAC and</font>

778
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:38,469
the iesg send a recommendation they may

779
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:40,269
make review like comments that's the

780
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,910
helpful hints i woke up for suggestions

781
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:48,729
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author's or textual suggestions</font>

782
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:53,969
which is the iesg note to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAC so</font>

783
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:56,799
then the is he has to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> them if the</font>

784
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:59,380
iesg p.m. had comments which would

785
00:45:56,799 --> 00:46:00,490
improve the draft then i will ask in

786
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">office to make</font>

787
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:06,750

once the ISC once<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

791
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,950
everything is done as it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be then</font>

792
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:27,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can pass it to the production</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

793
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:29,500
and when that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens I'll sent you a</font>

794
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:38,470
note to tell you that and you can follow

795
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:40,690
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the RFC a little Q or just</font>

796
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:43,569
puzzled<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly it's okay the things</font>

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,720
which of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg are now to say 4846</font>

798
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:50,350
gives them a list of possible responses

799
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:54,189
to a conflict early<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can say ok no</font>

800
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,799
problems they can say over lets the work

801
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,500
of such and such a working group but

802
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:04,390
still not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem those two are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

803
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,770
fine they can say this well essentially

804
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,270
they can say we're worried that this

805
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:10,570
will break the internet please don't

806
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:15,670
publish which is a recommendation to the

807
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:19,510
privacy so in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISE is sort</font>

808
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,359
of put under the cross is tim has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

809
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:27,640
decide am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish this anyway</font>

810
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:33,340
because I certainly can or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

811
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:36,400
is what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of the last seven</font>

812
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,690
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I've only ever up twice I have</font>

813
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and published a document</font>

814
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:43,450
which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> admirers ugc done so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

815
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,580
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does happen it doesn't</font>

816
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:48,250
happen very often it has to be something

817
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,020
which is quite important and especially

818
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">something which is widely deployed and</font>

819
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:58,740
used already and before the AC will do

820
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:02,200
that but it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible it can happen I</font>

821
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:06,430
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be useful to write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

822
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,470
any timeline one of the editorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> board</font>

823
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,890
members pointed out that this is the

824
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:14,189
optimistic best case if everything

825
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:17,879
really goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we would hope</font>

826
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,950
well the submission comes in it takes a

827
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,250
week or so to find reviewers and get

828
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:25,890
them committed to producing new reviews

829
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:28,610
they've got three weeks in when in which

830
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:32,819
they are expected to seem to review then

831
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:36,210
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors get to make whatever</font>

832
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:39,420
changes we needed so that's another two

833
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:43,500
weeks or so then I send it to the iesg

834
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:47,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg meets and they have Tony chats</font>

835
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:50,340
every two weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they regard for weeks</font>

836
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:54,870
as the normal time to go through

837
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:57,990
conflict review provided no problems

838
00:48:54,870 --> 00:49:01,080
come up along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way so the total of</font>

839
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:03,089
all of that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten weeks and that's the</font>

840
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,210
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would seem too graphic to</font>

841
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:08,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> production's engine and just do</font>

842
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:12,650
remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I may ask for</font>

843
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:17,900
revisions at any point along the way so

844
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:20,550
you may it may be a near-perfect draft

845
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,500
which doesn't need revisions and goes

846
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:26,010
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that much unchanged or it</font>

847
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,200
may be one which where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors had</font>

848
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,600
to spend quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time swapping</font>

849
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,870
email with reviewers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally get it</font>

850
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:37,759
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then they go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't</font>

851
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">come through the revisions at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stage</font>

852
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:43,590
now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tied and another one of the</font>

853
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,820
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the editorial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> board people</font>

854
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some</font>

855
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:51,870
statistics for them what goes through

856
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:53,640
the independent stream so I looked back

857
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:56,130
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last few years and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picked a</font>

858
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,690
year these weren't the really big number

859
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:04,920
years but it's a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years back</font>

860
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:09,230
2015 much 2015 through the notch 2016 in

861
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:13,850
that year now I had 93 drafts which I

862
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:17,100
had worked on during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year of those</font>

863
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:20,160
bottom of the slide there 39 were still

864
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:24,660
in my active list at the end of in March

865
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,399
2016 so anyone off the more waiting for

866
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,740
reviewers or waiting

867
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,079
yeah why keep looking for reviewers or

868
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,598
waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peruvians 18</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the more waiting</font>

869
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,000
on author's revisions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll comment</font>

870
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,339
some authors<font color="#E5E5E5"> once they've got the</font>

871
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,309
process started losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

872
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:42,930
away so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen from a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

873
00:50:41,309 --> 00:50:44,970
reminders to say are you still

874
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:51,480
interested I decide they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest</font>

875
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the list yes</font>

876
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,039
though those are 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise they'd</font>

877
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,750
have been handled and finished so the

878
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,119
ones that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished 22 of them were</font>

879
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:03,329
published so that's 22 in a year and

880
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,789
actually that's about what I was

881
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally led to believe would go</font>

882
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:11,039
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the street but those are the</font>

883
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones which was successfully published of</font>

884
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,270
the others two of them were moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

885
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:18,808
independent street they sorry meant to

886
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:22,288
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF stream so these were ones where</font>

887
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,809
I and move the various reviewers said

888
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:28,470
look this world really this should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

889
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:30,599
working group and so I managed

890
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to persuade an area director or working</font>

891
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:37,950
groups you to pick it up and take it

892
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:40,799
over so that work then and 19 were

893
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,868
withdrawn by authors which is my polite

894
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:46,910
way of saying lost interest in went away

895
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:51,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 were just plain outright rejected</font>

896
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:54,450
so the RFC editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> named for that is DMV</font>

897
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:57,029
do not publish so there's quite a lot of

898
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:01,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">material goes through the stream one way</font>

899
00:51:57,029 --> 00:52:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">or another and you can see and the fact</font>

900
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:09,690
that you send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me doesn't it the</font>

901
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:13,680
odds aren't all that high for being

902
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:16,770
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> published but I do my best to</font>

903
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:21,720
push it to where where I think it would

904
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:23,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">be best handled and yes there's pretty</font>

905
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,759
good understanding about that right

906
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:29,119
through now I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> resist a slide</font>

907
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,880
about myths of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent stream</font>

908
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,289
don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea that pushing taking a</font>

909
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,359
document through the independent screen

910
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:39,690
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be faster than getting it through a</font>

911
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:40,270
working group of course those of you who

912
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,130
are

913
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,960
we involved with working groups know

914
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even from the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you finally</font>

915
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,920
managed to get it on the list working

916
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,480
their documents it can still be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

917
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,710
of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time fits through and</font>

918
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,540
maybe the independent screen can do

919
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:57,970
better network ten weeks was the

920
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:00,430
optimistic deaths case so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible</font>

921
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:04,029
but it doesn't happen ever like that

922
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:06,279
very often and the other thing which

923
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:09,250
really is rather important not just

924
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,500
funny is that you can't use the

925
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:16,750
independent spring all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your lies I've</font>

926
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:18,370
not change these two elements oops it

927
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:23,020
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make an end run around</font>

928
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work you do no it really can't will</font>

929
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:30,700
awake to that idea and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOC does take</font>

930
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:32,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap to say would this</font>

931
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,960
be better in some particular working

932
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,149
group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheers have you</font>

933
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,150
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen lyst do you think it would</font>

934
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be good on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working group and if the</font>

935
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:46,500
effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> is case then I will come back and</font>

936
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">say look for three minutes to go to hear</font>

937
00:53:48,330 --> 00:54:02,250
last slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopeful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's now this</font>

938
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a tradition with with the RFC editor</font>

939
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:10,480
John Costello did this from way way back

940
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:16,200
they don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist so don't publish</font>

941
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:21,700
them isn't post the essence it drives

942
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:28,419
send them directly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me or to the RC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

943
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:31,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it the RFC editor that is the series</font>

944
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:36,220
editor myself and some of the artsy

945
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:38,740
editors look at them but work out are

946
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:43,890
any of these good enough to be actually

947
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">published and and we'll pick a few and</font>

948
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:53,400
publish it if reg that's going to happen

949
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:55,470
then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bearing in mind</font>

950
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:59,630
the thing about April first draft is

951
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the only time critical droughts</font>

952
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,810
they have to be published on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

953
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:06,980
day otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wouldn't be April</font>

954
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:09,960
first direct which means they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

955
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:15,990
reviewed and edited so you have to get

956
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:19,590
them to their our co2<font color="#CCCCCC"> or me by not too</font>

957
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:22,979
far into March worst case the middle of

958
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:24,360
much so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the only these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

959
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:31,500
only ones that really go through very

960
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:34,740
quickly but anyway and then we get

961
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:40,560
something new of the order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cups half</font>

962
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:47,250
a dozen maybe eight submissions some of

963
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:49,680
them are just driven to be while I'm

964
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:54,330
standing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready my hands here to be</font>

965
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:57,210
accepted as an april first draft jon

966
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:59,130
postel and Bob Braden both said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

967
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,900
should be able to a good people should

968
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:03,480
read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at least the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

969
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:09,510
second page before they realize it's a

970
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:12,770
split and going back to avian carriers

971
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:15,060
and evil bit and the one my favorite and

972
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:17,580
faster-than-light communication and yes

973
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equations tell you that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp will</font>

974
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,900
still work when we have

975
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,510
faster-than-light communications

976
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:27,570
technically great but the bottom line is

977
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:28,950
they've got to be funny able to appeal

978
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:33,330
to people with a technical background

979
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:35,549
you'll see from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> back so last year</font>

980
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:40,020
there weren't any like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he didn't</font>

981
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:43,350
publish any a professor as a result<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

982
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:47,730
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather beeper number higher number</font>

983
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:53,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of submissions this year so look out for</font>

984
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:55,990
this year's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed RFC's and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yes</font>

985
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,300
this one really is that ice how to

986
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:02,140
contact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAC well you can email me</font>

987
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:05,770
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email address CIAC at RFC</font>

988
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:08,650
edited bottle and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

989
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do is to do officers during ITF</font>

afternoon that really is oh no it's not

998
