[Music]

6
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,830
sometime

7
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,880
hello welcome everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm pleased to</font>

welcome you for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty second and</font>

9
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,200
imagine meeting the of it for today

10
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,410
meeting is next steps in autonomic

11
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,360
networking it's a one-hour session so it

12
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,260
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a big shot that we have today to</font>

13
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,990
presentation first not well which are

14
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,909
all aware but please do not this well

15
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,580
have quick overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda for</font>

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">today I'll take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few minutes just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,219
give a status on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research group</font>

18
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,780
activity and then I will introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

19
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,530
first speech of today self-driving

20
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,179
networks from 280<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kampala networks and</font>

21
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,059
then we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a second presentation</font>

22
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,090
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a person nombre on the autonomic that</font>

23
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,790
working response rate respected and the

24
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">remaining time will be allocated to an</font>

25
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,030
open discussion try to identify the gaps

26
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:16,950
challenges and define a roadmap<font color="#CCCCCC"> for next</font>

27
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:20,700
step in atomic networking so a quick

28
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:23,240
research group status we have a couple

29
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of active IDs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've gone through a</font>

30
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,250
researcher class called beginning of

31
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,580
this year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has passed and is</font>

32
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,640
currently ready for IRS you video

33
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:38,760
channel to IRS year after this maybe

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,969
then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a second draft on IP</font>

35
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,450
fix an emerging occasion this draft was

36
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,090
in our ESG complete review and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

37
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that outcome is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to go</font>

38
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,760
through the IETF review and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> NC</font>

39
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,960
approval so we have a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

40
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,180

session for energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the one option is</font>

53
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:35,789
to be a part of the discussion of today

54
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,380
we plan to have also a meeting in Prague

55
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,669
dedicated to a workshop on measurement

56
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,229
based network management which is a

57
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,080
series of workshop organized together

58
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,240
with energy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possibly based on</font>

emoji meeting in ihe f100 in Singapore

62
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,360
and not this year so the pics remain to

63
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,550
be defined but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also some people</font>

64
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,310
suggesting to have a full day workshop

65
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,880
in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the IHF meeting on a</font>

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">futon driven networking so we will try</font>

67
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,810
to post more information on this purpose

slide for the research group status we

70
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:20,948
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to develop and focus the</font>

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,139
research group on a set of key topics

72
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,810
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing work and we tend to</font>

73
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,849
share the research arena we are bringing

74
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,889
together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alessandro as soon as</font>

75
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,169
possible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need your input and</font>

76
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,970
feedback we have posted some elements

77
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,710
and got last year on the on the mailing

78
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,590
list so we appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> your feedback on</font>

79
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,150
that and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will try to build</font>

80
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:45,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">upon this the outcome of today's meeting</font>

81
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:48,190
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font>

82
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you to come and this presentation</font>

83
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,449
on self-driving networks

84
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:11,719
thanks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inviting me here</font>

85
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:16,849
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is kind of a a vision</font>

86
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:20,240
an idea that don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me how to</font>

87
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do this quite yet I have some</font>

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,889
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> around this but I do want I mean</font>

89
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,610
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this for almost</font>

90
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,039
18 months now and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get beyond</font>

91
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,539
talking about it to thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

92
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:39,409
we might realize this so next slide so

93
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,770
um I made a presentation at the mpls

94
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,890
World Congress a year ago so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

95
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,860
first public presentation about

96
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,770
self-driving networks and I the way I

97
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,089
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is I draw an analogy</font>

98
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:58,160
with the sub driving car and there you

99
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,660
know there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vision which was DARPA</font>

100
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,850
Grand Challenge which happened in 2004

101
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,600
to where we are today where everyone is

102
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,510
trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the act and so the</font>

103
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,940
question is what what kind of trigger

104
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:20,630
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take for us to start building</font>

105
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:23,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and beyond that you know when can</font>

106
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,660
we actually see this in action so next

107
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:30,050
slide so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-driving car</font>

108
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,439
journey you might have a kick to it in

109
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,689
2004 DARPA issued a grand challenge

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,440
saying can you drive build a sub driving

111
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,790
car they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically wanted the car to</font>

112
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,750
drive itself with no human intervention

113
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,849
240<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers on a deserted stretch of</font>

114
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,450
sorry on a stretch of freeway in the

115
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,040
Southern<font color="#CCCCCC"> California desert but they they</font>

116
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,320
did make sure that there is no other one

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,260
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other cars there so only the robotic</font>

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,450
cars and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very well</font>

119
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,540
contained problem but the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

120
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,830
around in 2004 nobody could do it they

121
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,920
reget the child

122
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:17,570
in 2005 and five teams actually

123
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:20,900
succeeded but and then they went on from

124
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,990
that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google car that you see</font>

125
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,949
there are way more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is a better</font>

126
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,990
term today so in this in that period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

127
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years you have a fully autonomous</font>

128
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,930
car so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> car doesn't have a pedal</font>

129
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:38,330
doesn't have a steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> wheel it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

130
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,400
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive itself now then of course</font>

131
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,410
along the way they took Alexis and put a

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,170
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on it and show you how</font>

133
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lexus could work but they do say</font>

134
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:52,969
that hey you need a driver and in case

135
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,280
the robotic car the driver robotic

136
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,680
driver could not do it the human has to

137
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,720
take over with this car the human the

138
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,130
only thing that human can do is open the

139
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:09,110
window and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump from what i understand</font>

140
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:11,750
i'm not actually driven in this next so

141
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,250
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what would the sub driving</font>

142
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:19,780
network do and so the first step is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,640
accept guidance from a human operator

144
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:27,110
you are now that you have this autonomic

145
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:30,590
network or a sub driving network he can

146
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,170
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere or she and you know in a</font>

148
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,530
that's perfectly fine but the rest

149
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,520
everything else will be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about zero touch provisioning and you</font>

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,550
called anima but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go beyond all</font>

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,830
that yes you do have to you know figure

156
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,770
out what the pieces are put them

157
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:06,440
together and self<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure but you also</font>

158
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,420
have to detect that something change you

159
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,820
have to say hey a customer came on board

160
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,150
you have to provision that customer you

161
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to monitor that if the customers</font>

165
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,389
to do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

166
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:29,719
think that a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator does should</font>

167
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:31,579
be done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same so that's that's the</font>

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,369
idea of a self-driving network so it's

169
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:36,349
not any one piece of this is not any one

170
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:38,749
small part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network it's the</font>

171
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:43,970
entire network being completely manually

172
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:47,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">run completely automatically run next so</font>

173
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,600
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again drawing an analogy with</font>

174
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,610
cars I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these five basic</font>

175
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,249
technologies that are needed the first

176
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,529
is telemetry the second is

177
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:01,670
multi-dimensional views so having

178
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,259
independent telemetry is fine but you

179
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,229
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put them together and</font>

180
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:08,779
start you're getting more insight from

181
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,029
your network the third is automation and

182
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:13,269
that's fairly clear the fourth is

183
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:17,299
decorative intent and this is now a very

184
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:19,399
young common buzzword much better than

185
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN buzzword by the way I should</font>

186
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,679
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that self-driving network is</font>

187
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,209
another expansion of SDN so if you don't

188
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

189
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:33,979
who is carefully chosen yes but

190
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,199
decorative intent is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

191
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we put our fingers too</font>

192
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:40,069
deeply into networks and we should be

193
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to step away and let the network do</font>

194
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:45,469
its thing and the last year's

195
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,389
decision-making and decision-making can

196
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,259
be ruled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by scent or can be machine</font>

197
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning base but ultimately I have all</font>

198
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,759
this information great if if that

199
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,879
information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sitting there and</font>

200
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,739
doing nothing it's not helpful we need

201
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the point where we can make a</font>

00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,910
decision based on this and ideally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

203

204
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,679
decision on its own and can use a

205
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,869
rule-based system or can use machine

206
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,209
learning or can use a combination and

207
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:20,449
the Google self-driving car uses a

208
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:23,089
combination so next so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

209
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:25,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with telemetry on cars and there's</font>

210
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:27,410
a usual thing is the spirometer the gas

211
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">case as the tire pressure sensors</font>

212
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,319
there's a tachometer which I didn't put

213
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,970
up here these are all helpful to you

214
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,610
don't give you some idea about how you

215
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be driving</font>

216
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:43,089
maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should change gears you can</font>

217
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,790
hear the engine is no working too hard

218
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:47,980
or you can look at the tachometer or you

219
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,870
look at the speedometer and say maybe I

220
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,350
should speed up anyway I should slow

221
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,140
down more recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> people put a radar so</font>

222
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,630
that you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this smart cruise</font>

223

229
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,859
cameras for all kinds of things like you

230
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,439
know finding out who hit you these are

231
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,390
all to help a human drive but when

232
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google said I want the car to drive</font>

233
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,750
itself they asked what what kind of

234
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,089
telemetry do do I not have which would

235
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">be really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful and so they put this</font>

236
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,980
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a lighter the lighter is</font>

237
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,420
eighty thousand dollars that they put

238
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,170
this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lexus which is seventy</font>

239
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,349
thousand dollars so you had you had the

240
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,860
slider you had dual cameras for stereo

241
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:48,310
imaging you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful pc all</font>

242
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,890
this other equipment they put on the car

243
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,689
for sharp<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving with 150 thousand</font>

244
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,120
dollars but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lidar was the biggest</font>

245
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,779
most expensive part and for those who

246
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:04,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">are curious you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

247
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:07,750
search for google or way mo uber and

248
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:11,439
lidar and interesting stuff will pop up

249
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put this up here is when</font>

250
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,250
we talk about telemetry we're talking

251
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,380
about telemetry that will help a human

252
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,690
operator run the network more

253
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,480
efficiently but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we also need to</font>

254
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it we're not thinking</font>

255
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we really want the network to</font>

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:31,149
run itself the same way that Google sort

257
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:34,120
of came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with the lighter so here's I</font>

258
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:38,769
think where we are today in part where

259
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:45,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we could be essentially n stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Isaiah</font>

260
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:48,730
thanks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have out here or I'm not in</font>

261
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,930
the box that ok I'll get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the box</font>

262
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,440
quickly

263
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,829
you're having here<font color="#E5E5E5"> a collector and you</font>

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,710
have here a network element and

265
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:03,430
basically rather than doing SNMP queries

266
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,679
all the time you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be</font>

267
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,480
able to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box this is a kind of</font>

268
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,230
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

269
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,120
streaming to you in real time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

270
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,920
don't want to be polling for this and so

271
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,829
you want the telemetry to be really

272
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,929
efficient very efficiently encoded and

273
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,609
you want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be coming at you all the</font>

274
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:24,429
time so you have a sense of what's going

275
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:28,300
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a very critical</font>

276
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:30,270
part today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get information in parts</font>

277
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,010
in places that we we sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're useful</font>

278
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,870
we dump them into our<font color="#E5E5E5"> database we then</font>

279
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,270
take the disc and bury it somewhere deep

280
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,949
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground so that if someone asks</font>

281
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it is there but we don't use it</font>

282
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:46,420
again and I am being facetious virtual

283
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:48,610
we need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more the second thing</font>

284
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,600
we need is this multi-dimensional views

285
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:54,699
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the next slide which is not</font>

286
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,199
just you know get this piece of data

287
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and get some other piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gator</font>

288
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,490
there and get some surface of data

289
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,520
somewhere else but be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to correlate</font>

290
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,860
these so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can correlate across layers</font>

291
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,420
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you can correlate across</font>

292
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,580
geographies you can correlate what's

293
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,580
happening it appeared<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what's</font>

294
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,699
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your network you can do</font>

295
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,409
time based analysis trending so you know

296
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,809
what's normal you know what's the

297
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,120
baseline and you know what's maybe not

298
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,460
Arnold and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives you a hint</font>

299
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,860
maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look more into why the</font>

300
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,630
traffic change or why this user is

301
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,250
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other user way he's never</font>

302
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:39,070
talk to that person before so it's not

303
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,170
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the data it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

304
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,629
pour that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data into a data make which is</font>

305
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expression that people use where you</font>

306
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,820
can correlate these things and you can

307
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,059
get much deeper insight from from the

308
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:57,309
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the third is</font>

309
00:18:52,059 --> 00:19:00,700
automation and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

310
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:02,860
have to slightly sanitize this hopefully

311
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a good job but this is an</font>

312
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,620
example of

313
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,909
a device network element at the bottom

314
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,489
you have the hardware you have the

315
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,230
chassis and the line cards about that

316
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:18,550
you have an OS and above that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

317
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:22,980
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and networking is</font>

318
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:25,270
bringing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our os's and our software</font>

319
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,150
things that are typically seen in

320
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:32,050
servers for server automation so you

321
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:35,320
have ansible puppet chef salt you've got

322
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:38,500
python script and Ruby scripts and then

323
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,929
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have we've been moving in</font>

324
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,240
the direction of net<font color="#E5E5E5"> pump or restaurant</font>

325
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,610
so you can you can operate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

326
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,950
remotely<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can operate the box from a</font>

327
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,260
more centralized thing so when everyone

328
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,360
says CLI is such a horrible thing well

329
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,930
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use your life or your</font>

330
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,679
CL I think this be and in town not<font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font>

331
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:03,000
call from within the box but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

332
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,760
allows you to to start automating and

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,040
understanding how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know upgrade a</font>

334
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,350
whole bunch of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> all together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,420
make the same type of change on a number

336
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,520
of devices instead of having to log into

337
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,920
each one so automation is really

338
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,590
important again the analogy with cars if

339
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,320
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the google subtyping car the</font>

340
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,480
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> more car it's an electric car so it</font>

341
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,550
doesn't have to worry about years and

342
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,190
stuff there's a number of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

343
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,740
become much simpler but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

344
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,880
didn't have that if you had to have a

345
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,340
physical petal moving thing so sort of a

346
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,860
foot that was changing gears for you

347
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,040
it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more complicated then if</font>

348
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,469
you could just tap into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and make</font>

349
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:53,020
the car stop or change gears or whatever

350
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:55,930
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation is really important the</font>

351
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,800
next is this decorative statement of

352
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,570
intent so in the car if you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

353
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,490
pedal if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a steering wheel</font>

354
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,050
what are you going to do well you have a

355
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,150
little dashboard and you can say i want

356
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to the airport hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in a hurry</font>

357
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the fastest time or I'm a</font>

358
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:17,230
cheapskate so take the path doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

359
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have any tolls or like me I'm</font>

360
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font>

361
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,720
I'm always like great I've got range

362
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,720
anxiety so find a way that will have the

363
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,670
least use of battery but whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

364
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,230
you sort of say this is what I want and

365
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,110
you might give some hints about how to

366
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,780
get there rather than giving all the

367
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,510
details of you you should take 101 in

368
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the area so i would take 101 and i'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

369
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,070
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left lane except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this place</font>

370
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,470
where i know i need to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

371
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,929
lane I should exit here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get on</font>

372
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,230
there all those details you don't have

373
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,900
to worry about anymore but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font>

374
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,610
can go even better and say hey car just

375
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,530
talked to my phone they'll tell you what

376
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,429
my appointment next appointment is and

377
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,740
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take me there so I mean the this</font>

378
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:07,060
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intent you can get</font>

379
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,970
higher and higher level in hand so I've

380
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,610
talked at I think with the SD NRG a few

381
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:16,780
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I don't think with an</font>

382
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:18,639
MIP about sdn as a compiler where you

383
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,060
essentially give a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decorative</font>

384
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,850
statement of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you want to do</font>

385
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:27,190
and then it will compile it it process

386
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,610
it and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay device one device to</font>

387
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:33,700
device three here's what you need to do

388
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:36,010
today we you just get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the</font>

389
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,190
device and start typing at the CLI so

390
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,930
we're focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how not why or what but</font>

391
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,540
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> should get to the watch and</font>

392
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:48,540
say this is what I want how you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

393
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:51,070
don't care that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job and the last</font>

394
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,830
technology is this decision making<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

395
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,379
you have this idea of either rule based

396
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,939
learning or machine learning rule based

397
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,330
learning you put down some simple rules

398
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,280
if this then that and and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

399
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,960
say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't quite cover it well</font>

400
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
put another condition is this and that

401
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and as you keep putting these conditions</font>

402
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,300
on each one is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple but very</font>

403
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quickly it becomes very complex for</font>

404
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,480
handle in<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle is also very</font>

405
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:22,420
deterministic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you could read this the</font>

406
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,750
set of if this and that and say I know

407
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,750
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is doing or what we'll do but</font>

408
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is very very cumbersome in machine</font>

409
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,480
learning you say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk you</font>

410
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,700
through something

I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how I how I would</font>

do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a million such</font>

413
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:43,120
examples then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn and so your</font>

account or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan Turing this is the</font>

416
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,240
can become very creative and machine

learning has become really really

418
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,800
powerful part of that is we have much

419
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,570
more data today and part of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

computers we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few better</font>

algorithms with the algorithms that are

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least of it so it is a very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">frustrated learn complex behavior the</font>

425
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,680
problem is we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it got</font>

there and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do so</font>

typically you pair the machine running

<font color="#E5E5E5">with rules so you say drive stay within</font>

the white lines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all that but</font>

430
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,520
you'll put a rule thing do not kill a

431
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,020
human if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can avoid it and of course</font>

432
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions about</font>

433
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,180
if you do have a kill a human which one

434
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,250
would it be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passenger the little</font>

435
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,410
girl here or the old man<font color="#CCCCCC"> there it's like</font>

436
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,260
you know and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there they actually</font>

437
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">have courses in ethics of machine</font>

438
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:44,740
learning no<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs this is yours okay so</font>

439
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,900
these are the technologies I also see

440
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,460
sort of like they have five levels of

441
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:53,410
autonomy for self-driving cars you can

442
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,100
kind of put up five levels of

443
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,400
self-driving for networks you have

444
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,590
completely manual stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

445
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,990
where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly we do do some</font>

446
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,230
automation if you're gathering all this

447
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,670
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start crunching on it and</font>

448
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,620
visualizing it at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sense of</font>

449
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,040
what's going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network where</font>

450
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,379
the hotspots how does the hotspots move

451
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,500
around during the day during the week um

452
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,330
if you go further you can analyze this

453
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,920
and start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some deeper insights</font>

454
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,050
you can make maybe some predictions

455
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,430
about where you would have to add

456
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:32,669
capacity in three months or ways where

457
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,960
things are happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next is</font>

458
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:38,050
recommendations so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of this</font>

459
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,750
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed-loop system I learn stuff</font>

460
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:44,800
from from the network I operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

461
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,250
and then I make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision rather than</font>

462
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,290
make

463
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,630
the decision yourself up for the machine

464
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,610
you could tell a human this is what I

465
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">would do and then the human could say</font>

466
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,929
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know based on their experience yeah</font>

467
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,070
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do or not you</font>

468
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:02,230
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data I should I</font>

469
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">should take over but at the end we want</font>

470
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,470
to get to it's totally self driving and

471
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:11,620
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what they call level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

472
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,690
autonomy for cards anyway so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

473
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,449
get this kicked off well if we take the

474
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:19,740
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Grand Challenge I would</font>

475
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:23,290
propose a networking and challenge and

476
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,330
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let's do this fine so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

477
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,520
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high level architecture of</font>

478
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,850
how this might work and this is the

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,379
closed loop that I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about so</font>

480
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,070
you get data from the network you

481
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:38,110
analyze it you make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit or you go</font>

482
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,610
through a decision module and you make

483
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,550
some take some action back in the

484
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,610
network if you do this then you're

485
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:48,210
constantly optimizing so based on what

486
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:51,429
your intent or what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level</font>

487
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,740
decorative statement is I'm going to

488
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,750
constantly go through this loop or a new

489
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,630
customer came on board new subscriber

490
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,720
came on board what do I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I did</font>

491
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:04,150
it monitor yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person is happy</font>

492
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">nope they're not happy make some changes</font>

493
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,850
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going um I do want to stop</font>

494
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,580
there for a second because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

495
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:16,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there's a lot of work for us to</font>

496
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">do if you're gathering a lot of</font>

497
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,990
information this telemetry has to be

498
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really efficient we need standardized</font>

499
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,390
data models and to a large extent we try

500
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,820
to do telemetry for human consumption

501
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:36,640
you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop doing that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

502
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,500
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on to you know</font>

503
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,350
putting this data in a form at the

504
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,200
machines can understand and can do the

505
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,449
analysis most efficiently and then they

506
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,780
can present it in a format that's useful

507
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,520
to humans also for the actions we need

508
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,809
to say how do we interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the box</font>

509
00:27:51,520 --> 00:28:01,970
what kind of things do we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

510
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:04,940
next so here keep checking through so

511
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,120
the grand challenge will be here is what

512
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,039
we want to do self-driving network with

513
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,320
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our definition I don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a prize</font>

514
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I will figure that out and the result</font>

515
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,980
would be to free up people to work at a

516
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,779
higher level to do service level

517
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:23,749
definitions to do new service design 22

518
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:26,389
maybe learn how to treat the AI to work

519
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:29,269
better the result would also be a much

520
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:31,039
more agile infrastructure which can

521
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:33,590
anticipate things because it has this

522
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,450
prediction engine and maybe the most

523
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,509
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> is faster intelligent response</font>

524
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,490
to security breaches and so here's an

525
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,580
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> but pick your favorite little</font>

526
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,139
thing and say can we go build up the

527
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I want you to think about</font>

528
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:50,809
not just the technology but what is the

529
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,970
impact and what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

530
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:56,090
possibilities what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do differently</font>

531
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:58,009
I mean completely differently from what

532
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,019
we do today if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a self-driving</font>

533
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:02,240
network and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few slides have</font>

534
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:04,309
some examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but this is really</font>

535
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,740
where you need to think about things so

536
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:09,470
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example there's a huge skill set</font>

537
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,860
change I'm an ospf geek and I know how

538
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:14,600
to set metrics not important but I need

539
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new service or</font>

540
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,689
tweak the air and so on you can read

541
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:24,769
them the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sort of crazy idea</font>

542
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:28,070
that for the next so i will tell you

543
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:31,580
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> olympics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for 2020 the planning</font>

544
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">side in 2015 and this kind of five-year</font>

545
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,289
cycle planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a big event is</font>

546
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,909
probably not the right way to do it it

547
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:41,570
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if you could wake up and</font>

548
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:43,460
say oh the Olympics are tomorrow order a

549
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,309
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they will come on a</font>

550
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:49,580
self-driving truck will you know they'll

551
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:53,629
set themselves down self-organized do

552
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:56,379
what they need to do and then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away so</font>

553
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:59,509
that's basically it I think we have a

554
00:29:56,379 --> 00:30:01,668
compelling vision I think so there's an

555
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:03,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">economic imperative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make operates</font>

556
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,539
really really much lower there is an

557
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:07,250
efficiency imperative there is an

558
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:11,139
agility imperative the security

559
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,139
imperative so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font>

560
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:19,250
custom yeah thank you karoke I think we

561
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,250
have a few typos question it's important

562
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:33,270
Mike hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jahi yes at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end so I'm not</font>

563
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">really familiar with that some kind of</font>

564
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,460
meal to that and try to understand what

565
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the difference between your proposal</font>

566
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,550
relation to other technologies like

567
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,110
automatic networks what is really new in

568
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:48,270
here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try to understand here so</font>

569
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,709
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of and I I have to</font>

570
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,500
apologize that I haven't followed

571
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,840
economic networks I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomly get</font>

572
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,550
into the animal working group or this

573
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,659
working group you know once in a while

574
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:02,879
or research group what I'm looking at is

575
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:06,360
a completely completely self-driven

576
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,930
network which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that</font>

577
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,120
human operators do in the NOC you know

578
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,640
whether in the central office in the pop

579
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,610
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the core all of this should</font>

580
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">just happen automatically and at some</font>

581
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,419
level human operators are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still needed</font>

582
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,040
but they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define things at a</font>

583
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,230
much higher level they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

584
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,240
here are the application that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mattered</font>

585
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me here the customer subscribers that</font>

586
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,520
matter to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me here the peers that matter</font>

587
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me here's my resources how would you</font>

588
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,680
organize yourself to maximize happiness

589
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:45,570
or whatever given this finite resources

590
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:49,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah this is a small portion and</font>

591
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:53,060
from the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have sown how much</font>

592
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,280
have you already implemented or

593
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:59,149
experimented with this do you have any

594
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:02,129
gets better or something like real thing

595
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,950
so what I started playing with is

596
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,770
looking at bandwidth and trying to come

597
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,990
up with a time series model for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>

598
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,900
problem is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough bandwidth</font>

599
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">right I need data for six months or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

600
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:19,260
year here's two things I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font>

601
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,910
the bandwidth one is to make if you do a

602
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,190
time series analysis they'll tell you

603
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,380
these are patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's some</font>

604
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,870
you know errors from the pattern and

605
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,080
here's the long-term trend so from the

606
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:33,899
long-term plan I can say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

607
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,590
know for LA to New York traffic I will

608
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,570
have to upgrade some some ports in six

609
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,570
months or three months or whatever so I

610
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,129
can do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> predictive analysis the</font>

611
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:48,629
second thing you can do is to say this

612
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:52,260
is normal traffic on monday at at 10am

613
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:55,620
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that the traffic are you</font>

614
00:32:52,260 --> 00:33:01,370
on this port at on<font color="#CCCCCC"> monday at ten a.m. is</font>

615
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,370
between 3.5 and 4.5 gig plus or minus

616
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay sub driving networks would not</font>

617
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:11,399
would not do that with the the the the

618
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:14,850
rules would prevent them so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

619
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,580
the the traffic at a certain time would

620
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,189
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> between this range and the traffic is</font>

621
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,020
significantly higher or lower it would

622
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,300
tell me you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look at that and</font>

623
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,500
this is data that's available today but

624
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:30,600
people don't do that kind of analysis so

625
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,630
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a front part i do want to do</font>

626
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,149
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like do syslog analysis</font>

627
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,740
using machine learning and say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

628
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,680
the root cause so instead of doing root

629
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,840
cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye rule-based systems which</font>

630
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,950
is typically how they were done<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

631
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,610
some people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

632
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,410
differently I want to use a syslog<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font>

633
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,120
I want to use machine learning to

634
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:57,300
analyze this<font color="#E5E5E5"> log data and say this is</font>

635
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,399
what happened yeah rated to that you

636
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,129
have mentioned time series analysis on

637
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,040
machine learning have you considered all

638
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:07,980
the kinds so for example expert systems

639
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,080
that can be even smarter than any

640
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,240
machine learning algorithm neither

641
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,880
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are from my point of view are</font>

642
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,189
actually really silly come comparison

643
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,270
with any expert system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits they</font>

644
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,670
sped from a human during some your own

645
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,449
period of time and after that you leave

646
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:31,110
the system running on itself so i'm not

647
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,629
at all against any technique so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really i</font>

648
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,640
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get into you know how to</font>

649
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,090
build this I the first step<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to say</font>

650
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,379
let's all

651
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:43,690
seriously build not just a an autonomic

652
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,510
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe let's take all of our</font>

653
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,190
networks and make them sub driving now

654
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,320
how you get there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

655
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,110
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find as we do it we need different</font>

656
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,120
technologies expert systems have a

657
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,400
problem that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have humans</font>

658
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,440
you'll give you a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys pitch them</font>

659
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,010
but but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is machine learning</font>

660
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,810
because machine line runs typically on

661
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:07,660
label data and you need humans to label

662
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,790
the data so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ideal way of</font>

663
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,730
doing it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we really say I</font>

664
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,500
mean when DARPA made the challenge they

665
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,370
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say use this technology they said</font>

666
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:21,670
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car should drive by itself Evan</font>

667
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:25,930
even we humans do not learn my ourselves

668
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:29,380
somebody teaches yes yes yes I i will

669
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:36,299
stop it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely work to</font>

670
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:40,180
discuss yeah then rotate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

671
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:43,020
interesting the vision um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

672
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:49,230
analogy is pretty pretty appropriate

673
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,230
though and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking that technically</font>

674
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:56,740
just like with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the autonomous car there</font>

675
00:35:52,810 --> 00:36:00,070
are probably networks that are pretty

676
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:06,970
self-sufficient it all comes down to

677
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:08,530
legacy scale and and these are the kinds

678
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of challenges the reason you don't see</font>

679
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:15,190
cars on the road today or they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

680
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,500
pushed out from the road like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font>

681
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,870
was just bored the day before uber

682
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,360
cancel though their experiments because

683
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,400
they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crash why because usually the</font>

684
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,830
humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that making the the</font>

685
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,870
accidents so extending your analogy

686
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,060
usually is the problem is with your

687
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,350
legacy system that may may have

688
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,740
interference with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your learning and self</font>

689
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:40,839
self-driving network um legacy it's a

690
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:44,080
big issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you got investments in</font>

691
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:47,440
there and and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what</font>

692
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,770
you're just putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this vision</font>

693
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,770
together

694
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:56,020
bits and pieces are there maybe we're

695
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,330
not using them efficiently maybe we're

696
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">not using them coherently but they are</font>

697
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,500
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what what is the deterrent the</font>

698
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:08,070
deterrent is what i just said scale and

699
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:12,730
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hybrid legacies yeah yeah</font>

700
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:15,790
yeah well yes and no today there's a lot

701
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:19,240
of human operation and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

702
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:23,230
because legacy the question I think is

703
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:26,229
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for the car when I when I went</font>

704
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,510
from a clutch based system to automatic

705
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,280
transmission I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier for a</font>

706
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,680
human to drive but the car still doesn't

707
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,780
drive itself it's when you start

708
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,490
thinking about what does it take<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

709
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,740
car to drive itself yes I have these

710
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,529
bits and pieces but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

711
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:45,009
have that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do not want to have a</font>

712
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,510
human involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I think you started</font>

713
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at things very different we also</font>

714
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:52,360
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vision we we we made it public</font>

715
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,920
it's called project indigo yeah and

716
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pretty much along the lines of</font>

717
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,810
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just presented cool that's good</font>

718
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:06,750
well I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of reflections one</font>

719
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:08,919
is when it comes to making<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

720
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,880
technology you're using I do when you

721
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this learn one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

722
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,070
problems that they say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it to</font>

723
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,930
face think some experiments who have

724
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,340
made is about data or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the availability</font>

725
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,859
no it's not only about the availability

726
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,660
of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is complicated to it and</font>

727
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,120
it's very complicated to share and to

728
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:31,660
convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data to</font>

729
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,609
share but is about the fact that when

730
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,540
you have a lot of raw data without

731
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:40,090
tagging without wobbling this basically

732
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:43,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">is having nothing I mean what more than</font>

733
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:46,750
nothing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> well then but what we have</font>

734
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">decided to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start in inside the our lab</font>

735
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:53,080
is something well even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have read</font>

736
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,570
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the immortality is it something</font>

737
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,670
that we call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouth work the abs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

738
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,250
you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you can play</font>

739
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,950
with things that well since<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

740
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,770
care because I like like mice

741
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:09,549
do whatever you want to do with the idea

742
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:12,190
of on the one hand generating on<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

743
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sets under control conditions and second</font>

744
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:17,800
generating noise but<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is that we</font>

745
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:19,690
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a is it now noise that</font>

746
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,089
we can combine we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making an</font>

747
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,460
experiment of this we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font>

748
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:28,660
to port on this for you and everyone

749
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,599
here if we we can talk about trying to

750
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this evolved I mean is that is a</font>

751
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,430
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a smart learning environments</font>

752
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:39,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say right this is one thing said</font>

753
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:42,549
second is a is because I when I was

754
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:45,940
younger than now not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so long</font>

755
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:51,099
ago I made my PhD thesis on fuzzy logic

756
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:53,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well lo and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on because i know i</font>

757
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,970
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is an ideal combination</font>

758
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,619
of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> fancies the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility of</font>

759
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,750
machine learning and the possibility of

760
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:02,530
having human language having it is

761
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,329
intelligible what you find well again I

762
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,520
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you have consider it</font>

763
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:08,109
because as a something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they ceased</font>

764
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,780
really powerful is not so in fashion

765
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:12,460
right now but I find it extremely

766
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,160
powerful because it's this combination

767
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,440
of the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to learn and the</font>

768
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,118
ability to express what has been learned

769
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,960
in something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is close to human</font>

770
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,300
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um thanks for comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

771
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">will say two things one is I went to my</font>

772
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,300
first conference in machine learning and

773
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:33,939
yes it was machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's nips neural</font>

774
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,480
information processing symptoms yeah in

775
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,260
Barcelona not so long ago and I do want

776
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go two more but the problem there is</font>

777
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,630
they want to polish a diamond even you

778
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:48,339
know finer and I don't want an algorithm

779
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,780
that's like ten percent faster and

780
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:52,569
twenty percent more accurate or no

781
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,770
whatever but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other things</font>

782
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:55,839
that are doing that are really

783
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,750
interesting which is multimodal learning

784
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,540
using different techniques and using

785
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,089
different types of data so if I'm trying

786
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,790
to understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying but I</font>

787
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:08,710
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice I'll have a</font>

788
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:11,380
certain accuracy but if i'm also missing

789
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,210
or seeing your face is so i can do

790
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,720
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can i apply those</font>

791
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,450
techniques in in the network so i get

792
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,209
data from the routers I get some data

793
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,520
from about traffic how can I put that

794
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:29,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a better influence</font>

795
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,310
about the network so and I'm not wedded

796
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,810
to machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

797
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine learning is in the news right</font>

798
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,070
now and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very powerful you're</font>

799
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:39,370
right that it's really really hard to

800
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:41,440
get lots and lots of label data there

801
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:44,290
are techniques for semi-supervised

802
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,870
learning and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some label data</font>

803
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,790
and then you try to extrapolate so but

804
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,799
that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest problem but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

805
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,620
the second problem is for us networking

806
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,240
guys we collect some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

807
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes we collect lots of data but we</font>

808
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,470
don't use it as a patient as we could so

809
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,410
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we even start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

810
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:06,700
and start understanding our networks

811
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:09,160
better would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> better but if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

812
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,230
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share your data yes we should</font>

813
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk this sharing sharing the</font>

814
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:18,910
environment for generating ball okay

815
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:23,859
okay okay yes small small things yes hey

816
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:25,660
Lou un-fun ebay so um since<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya go and</font>

817
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,670
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll mention the background I wasn't</font>

818
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,220
intend to but there was a common health

819
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,470
expert system<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge based system</font>

820
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,109
compared with the machine learning the

821
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:37,540
more deep learning stuff so my master

822
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:40,120
was expert system my PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in your</font>

823
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks so the neural networks with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

824
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,370
deep learning it's much more capable so

825
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,830
you don't I'll rely on from getting all

826
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:50,230
the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the expert pulling</font>

827
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:52,870
the knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> from experts difficult so</font>

828
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,850
that was long<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago reason years is</font>

829
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:59,950
all networking and now what we're doing

830
00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:02,680
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm very that's what we're</font>

831
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing actually including the bandwidth</font>

832
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">your mention of things we actually have</font>

833
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:12,029
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory data as Diego mention</font>

834
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:15,310
the data is now completely clean is not

835
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,800
complete right some portion maybe not

836
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:20,740
there some equipment thing I cannot

837
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">support this and the data is you know</font>

838
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:27,939
SNMP it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy and everybody has a</font>

839
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,700
lot of data sitting you know under but

840
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,820
it's hard to process is hard

841
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,160
to do it's because when I first ruling

842
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,869
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me look the whole day</font>

843
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,290
does that oh that's so much let me look

844
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:44,320
one more cluster oh that's too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much let</font>

845
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:47,560
me look one device let me look 24 hours

846
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,510
it's way beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing point so the</font>

847
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,060
data points there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data point</font>

848
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,530
because you continuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect that and</font>

849
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:58,540
also the SMP is cumbersome it's a wave

850
00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:00,490
pooling pool model right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

851
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:04,570
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telemetry is why important</font>

852
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:07,930
thing so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I resonator I want to</font>

853
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:11,079
make today what proven as the in the

854
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:13,770
past who go far to skill with the AI

855
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,869
machine learning it was machine speed

856
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:19,359
not there I'm big data not there today

857
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:22,750
we have big data but we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature</font>

858
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,819
with the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Machine</font>

859
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,310
speed is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the algorithm</font>

860
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,460
today it's as similar as<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 some years</font>

861
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,290
ago so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that algorithm is not a problem</font>

862
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,510
the first thing to attacker we also out

863
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:37,750
let's get the data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AI machine</font>

864
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:41,260
learning it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you you need to</font>

865
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:44,530
go lower layer right first you say how

866
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:47,230
do I process these data are these the

867
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:51,490
right way to collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this data the</font>

868
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:53,079
telemetry the the memory processing all

869
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,209
these things are are the important

870
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,609
things so you go down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level how</font>

871
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:00,819
do we you know ultimate many things

872
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:03,790
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can really drive it I mean I</font>

873
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:06,279
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say a self-driving network in the</font>

874
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:09,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense more difficult than self-driving</font>

875
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,220
car because but there's no that same

876
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:14,230
safety but self-driving heart what you

877
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,029
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you have a sensor you've got</font>

878
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures in front of you and</font>

879
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:21,400
around you a pack of you right you have

880
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,009
a navigation with how you were to go the

881
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,790
network is distributed that one is

882
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:30,460
limited space to worry about to process

883
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,920
right and we know the networking is not

884
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,170
like when we do speech recognition you

885
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,569
got labeled a date all over you can buy

886
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">them you can whatever right image all</font>

887
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:42,730
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available now working no label</font>

888
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,109
the data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned supervised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

889
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">supervise the learning</font>

890
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:50,980
our various things need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know combined</font>

891
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:54,400
together but we can use certain um maybe

892
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:57,310
not exactly math right to figure out

893
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,680
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we're trying to do</font>

894
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,049
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn the pattern because</font>

895
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,990
everything at the end it be long before

896
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,790
we do a is a pattern recognition right

897
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,609
you do all these things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Madame we</font>

898
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,620
want to establish the baseline pattern

899
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,830
then you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a tag pattern this</font>

900
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is false through the clip I'm that are</font>

901
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,090
very interesting about to be up still

902
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:22,570
some presentation to do yeah I'm not

903
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:24,910
just a conclusion about your comment my

904
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,640
comment this is the right direction and

905
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:30,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of layer work to do</font>

906
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:33,129
before we worry about which algorithm

907
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:36,400
choose telemetry collect the data get

908
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,350
the right data<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure thank</font>

909
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,840
you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> karakura</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T thanks a</font>

910
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,690
lot so we got nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision yes please</font>

911
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,610
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> come in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one remark if you</font>

912
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:47,260
want together<font color="#E5E5E5"> I listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what the same</font>

913
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,300
here we have to change our mind

914
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,910
regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non networks operation</font>

915
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,310
because what I try to say that the

916
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,990
network know everything so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

917
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:58,840
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carl for instance the</font>

918
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">switches if lecture today the singles we</font>

919
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,170
are debugging network for instance just

920
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">if something is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not working we are</font>

921
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,800
singing pink for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management station</font>

922
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:08,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like if the car is not driving</font>

923
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,830
correctly somebody sent from the central

924
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,360
office off<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know for Google a</font>

925
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,069
packet to the car and see if the quiet

926
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,260
car is not you know driving in the right

927
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:18,460
way so what I to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the switches</font>

928
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,220
the network and networking know

929
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,410
everything and we if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

930
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,330
information for this devices if you if

931
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pakatan if you have the gash in the</font>

932
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,650
service the switch you know it the

933
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,540
switch in order to do a pocket for sure

934
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,970
so we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think differently if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

935
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,460
want to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this you know that's the</font>

936
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,589
lighter yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writer exactly</font>

937
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,200
this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the lighter not the</font>

938
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:44,110
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thank you ok we have a</font>

939
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,790
presentation steel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we</font>

940
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,520
would have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss after that</font>

941
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:52,350
that I try to move on already already

942
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,350
part of the objective of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

943
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:03,549
so good afternoon my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Jefferson</font>

944
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:05,470
Aubrey and I my job is easier than the

945
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:08,560
from the previous speaker because I'm

946
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:11,459
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so I'm</font>

947
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,630
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about a</font>

948
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,890
retrospective about net autonomic

949
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:20,950
networking and it's not I know it's an

950
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,100
ambitious title for the presentation but

951
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:26,740
this it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the retrospective</font>

952
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:30,130
considering the efforts on the IDF oops

953
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:32,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">delta line is earlier introduction out</font>

954
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of networking at the end emergy the</font>

955
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:38,710
animal working group in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outlook next</font>

956
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,500
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a unknown set of</font>

957
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:44,350
properties of that we expect in

958
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,360
autonomic system and it's sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

959
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:49,089
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say which are which are the</font>

960
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:53,170
properties that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected them to say</font>

961
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:55,410
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an autonomic system but usually</font>

962
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:59,950
it is it is expected to be automatic

963
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:03,609
adaptive in our in order to define the

964
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:06,430
other or some different set of

965
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:10,060
properties that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are used so for example</font>

966
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:15,879
have the self<font color="#E5E5E5"> chop or the maid k and</font>

967
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:17,830
there are others but for our concern we

968
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,060
think that an autonomic networking

969
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:24,400
system isn't a the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

970
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,890
kind of properties in the network

971
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle so for example we can talk</font>

972
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:32,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the installation the commissioning</font>

973
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the operating like the monetary and the</font>

974
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:41,530
this kind of jobs in a network operation

975
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:45,070
so as usually it's necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

976
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:49,360
some some reputation in the autonomic

977
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:52,480
network insistent it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually used some</font>

978
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:56,530
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed-loop control so this is</font>

979
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,560
a simple sketch from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4k Oh system</font>

980
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:02,590
which is a influent autonomic network

981
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:06,340
management system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the the important</font>

982
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:09,070
thing on in the figures that it has a

983
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,800
two different components the autonomic

984
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:15,190
manager which collects information from

985
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,810
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also it's changing for</font>

986
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:20,320
example the configuration of autonomic

987
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:22,660
of managed resource in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed</font>

988
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:29,350
resource which provide information<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

989
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:33,060
the manager next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so the autonomic</font>

990
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:35,890
networking was the subject of several

991
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,400
research projects and the investigations

992
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:44,170
in the last few years in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> decade</font>

993
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:47,350
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example there is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> umf again and</font>

994
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:50,680
others and also considering the work in

995
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:52,660
the IETF there are some efforts and for

996
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:56,740
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk about some efforts</font>

997
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:59,440
in super<font color="#E5E5E5"> homenet as the energy and serg</font>

998
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:02,919
in the itrs so there are lots of

999
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,980
interesting and also and this is what

1000
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:10,120
brings me for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation the</font>

1001
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:12,160
autonomic networking investigations is

1002
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,740
usually addressed by the network

1003
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,500
management community so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we</font>

1004
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">can say about works that are published</font>

1005
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">in IM norms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CNS em so at this point we</font>

1006
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:27,700
can say that form a network management

1007
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:31,290
perspective autonomic networking

1008
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:36,210
something of is a subject of interesting

1009
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:41,200
in this regards there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of</font>

1010
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:44,890
meetings of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NMR G that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on</font>

1011
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:49,890

1013
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:56,859

leads to two drafts and that are now

there are three works that are

developing such protocols and for the

also the bootstrapping of a trust

the briefs<font color="#CCCCCC"> T and also the development of</font>

1071
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:14,080
so as there is a limited set of

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:16,600
functions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are defined in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">out of a scope that was presented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,440
for example can talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> polishing</font>

1082
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">tent use cases or autonomic service</font>

1083
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,700
agents and this in the charter of the

1084
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,610
animal working group is stated that this

1085
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,430
work can be is encouraged<font color="#CCCCCC"> as in g video</font>

1086
00:55:54,610 --> 00:56:01,540
submissions or in emerging submissions

1087
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:04,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's recognized that as outcome of</font>

1088
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:07,750
energy and energy is a good place to

1089
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,510
work with interesting work of autonomic

1090
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:14,440
networking budget which is outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1091
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:17,110
scope of the working group so right now

1092
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:20,590
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some in chart at work that</font>

1093
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:23,560
remains in an email waiting for new

1094
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,640
faces or the recharter of the group so

1095
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,580
for example that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote some</font>

1096

coordination the intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> format in</font>

00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:38,380
works that are from the you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are still in the energy and focus</font>

1100
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,750
there's this work about submit

1104
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:56,950
let's go by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way so finishing</font>

1105
00:56:53,740 --> 00:57:02,350
anything that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> me really quick this</font>

1106
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:04,629
but the definitions and the goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

gap analysis of the autonomic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

1108
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:10,840
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> need more consideration</font>

1109
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:15,460
considering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and we think that</font>

1110
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:18,340
maybe the MRG is a possible a good home

1111
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:20,560
for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion this kind of</font>

1112
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:24,400
analysis so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example there is an</font>

1113
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:27,610
internet draft about the network network

00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:31,510
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitions which is this it should</font>

1115
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:36,610
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> complementary to the RFC 75 75 and</font>

1116
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:39,850
the he it is only state<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe and he</font>

1117
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:42,400
said before so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one of the authors of</font>

00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:45,190
this draft but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">contributors so if you want to work on</font>

1120
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:53,290
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were welcomed in there are some</font>

1121
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,840
other point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe also can be can</font>

1122
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:59,380
use an mr g as a home for example

1123
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:02,170
machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nuh as i said before as</font>

1124
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:05,100
presented before it's also something

1125
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:10,680
which is really important considering

1126
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:13,930
self self star or autonomic systems and

1127
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,060
besides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe the</font>

1128
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:20,919
definitions of autonomic networking our

1129
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:23,230
previous from the the wave of network

1130
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">machining learning so probably some</font>

1131
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">cutters some some room for investigation</font>

1132
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:33,370
try to compatible eyes both areas

1133
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:35,799
there's also the works on intense which

1134
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know it's kind of a controversial</font>

1135
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,650
topic but currently it's out of scope of

1136
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:45,460
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nema and i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also it's out of</font>

1137
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:48,160
scope of super so maybe if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

1138
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:51,890
interested in working in writing down

RG working groups research groups and

1149
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:30,260
the works on that also can be done

1150
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:37,390
considering for example management

1153
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:47,539
technologies is typical time-consuming

1154
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:50,109
and labor-intensive tasks so and I'm

1155
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:52,940
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it's important to to</font>

concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the energy to do that and</font>

1157
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:57,920
maybe the energy can do this kind of

00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,099
stuff you know like a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

different portions of autonomic topics

01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:14,288
can be can be dried together in an MLG

1162

1165
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:23,420
reflect on what we have discussed today

1166
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,640
and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked the presentation in</font>

1167
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,519
the discussion we had I think a piece on

1168
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:30,890
my notes I only try a set of key points

1169
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:33,769
of discussion we came back regularly on

1170
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:35,990
that I mean the version which start what

1171
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:37,939
should be the end point of the surviving

1176

interesting topics that you could tackle

1177
01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:53,750
in this in this research group what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1178
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:56,000
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to invite you is ready to</font>

1179
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,400
express we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time right now but</font>

1180
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,319
maybe you can go to the mic that what

1181
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,299
will be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps we should take</font>

1182
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,690
in the research group to say do we start

1183
01:01:02,299 --> 01:01:05,640
a new document which

1184
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:08,250
we can sub sub set of topics we can

1185
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,890
identify what action concrete actions we

1186
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,450
can take really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this work</font>

01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:17,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> while also follow out of this</font>

1189
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:21,240
discussion so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if anyone</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to propose something or to be the</font>

1195
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:45,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point here is that we have</font>

1196
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:48,000
several main places in which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1197
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:51,210
many touch points and there are a lot of

1198
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,140
fussy songs in which you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> end one</font>

1199
01:01:51,210 --> 01:02:01,140
side on the other probably will not be

1200
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:04,500
the bad idea to start why try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mmm</font>

1201
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:07,020
identify gaps and challenges and the

1202
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">anguish which are the directions to move</font>

1203
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:14,670
in i mean in a document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we</font>

1204
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:17,390
can discuss home rather than sharing a

1205
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:20,010
DSP consistent and a 12 I can agree with

1206
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:21,569
for example what you mentioned is about

1207
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,910
the programmable networks i mean the

1208
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:26,520
proneural networks in general what do

1209
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:29,160
you have any fee on the one hand you

1210
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">have whatever is coalesced yang</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

1211
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,040
at the end of the like a software

1212
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:35,280
networks in general is this is something

1213
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:40,250
that whenever we move<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there will be</font>

01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this position which whether this is</font>

1215
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,229
software based networks whatever all

1216
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,750
we're talking about server software

1217
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,280
based network management is a little bit

1218
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,800
if you think in terms in the same terms

1219
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,240
and when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system</font>

1220
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,010
you have the applications running and

1221
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,240
then you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1222
01:02:56,010 --> 01:03:02,520
managing the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

1223
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:05,430
applications at the end well drawing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1224
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,400
line is challenging anyway but it would

1225
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:12,569
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some kind of</font>

1226
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:14,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">document to discuss on refractory let's</font>

1227
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:16,770
call it challenging so or research

1228
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:19,830
directions or whatever but

1229
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:23,750
the lug nuts and I would be happy to be

1230
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:26,580
a to be part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a team vil thanks legal</font>

1231
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:31,470
cubic<font color="#CCCCCC"> impella um I would be really</font>

1232
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:34,230
interested in two things one is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

1233
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:36,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">about standardized data models but I</font>

1234
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:40,590
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1235
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:42,480
models to play with them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not to</font>

1236
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:44,940
have a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily but to have</font>

1237
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,280
an evolving standard as we understand

1238
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,830
the data better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that other people</font>

1239
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,540
who work with telemetry have said all

1240
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,460
this is a great data model and then they

1241
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,740
realize it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the best friend and</font>

1242
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,500
they have to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing it so that</font>

1243
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:02,339
sort of fits better in an RG rather than

1244
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:05,010
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf and the second thing is can we</font>

1245
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,810
have a repository of data data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1246
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,510
hard to find people are scared about

1247
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:11,850
sharing data but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have a</font>

1248
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:14,550
repository of data then people can say

1249
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:16,110
let me use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and try some</font>

1250
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:21,300
experiment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tried before</font>

1251
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:24,140
so there are the thing called cago with

1252
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:29,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just part by the way so you know</font>

1253
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:33,180
there are repositories of pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1254
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:35,640
you know and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to recognize</font>

1255
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,779
a cat rather than downloading a million

1256
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,060
things from the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1257
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,770
download this set of data and run your

1258
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:44,100
algorithm and say are you better are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1259
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:47,640
more accurate whatever so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sorry</font>

1260
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:50,480
yeah so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could find repository or</font>

1261
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:53,520
we could build repository of data

1262
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,580
network oriented data that people could

1263
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,430
then say let me try correlating this and

1264
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:01,710
that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something else</font>

1265
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:04,440
because that's the foundation and I

1266
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,830
should repeat I don't want to do machine

1267
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,150
learning I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop driving network</font>

1268
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:11,640
machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning I think will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1269
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,020
there but I'm open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anything else the</font>

1270
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,290
goal is important and then the

1271
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:19,290
technology comes afterwards Thank

1280
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:50,560
and we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be stuck with trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1281
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,190
implement it and as an architect<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1282
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:57,670
really dislike that um the first is

1283
01:05:54,190 --> 01:06:00,010
intent everyone is talking about it it

1284
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:06,090
was everywhere at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mpls World</font>

1285
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:10,270
Congress and it's very very

1286
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:12,400
misunderstood um so I'm also the

1287
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:17,259
orchestration area director for the em

1288
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:20,260
EF and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a definition and</font>

1289
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:24,610
solution and perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can share that</font>

1290
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:31,540
here in NM r g and get a wider view on

1291
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:33,880
this and uptake um the second is unlike

1292
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:41,580
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do like machine</font>

1293
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:46,390
learning I<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't resist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry Caretti</font>

1294
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:50,920
yeah um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I forget the</font>

1295
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:57,460
person from ebay<font color="#CCCCCC"> June or Julie or what</font>

1296
01:06:50,920 --> 01:07:01,390
yes do you want oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sorry I've got a</font>

1297
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:03,670
bad hearing um but you know one of the

1298
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:06,640
interesting things in deep learning is

1299
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:09,310
that that distinguishes it from prior

1300
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,950
types of learning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it doesn't</font>

1301
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:14,920
have to be homogeneous right so as I

1302
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:17,890
build my layers of machine learning I'm

1303
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,710
free to use different abstractions and

1304
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:25,180
different mechanisms from layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> x2 layer</font>

1305
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">X plus 1 which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can think of as</font>

1306
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:32,620
allowing different algorithms to provide

1307
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:36,069
fine-tuned parts or pieces of the

1308
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:39,130
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean this is true</font>

1309
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:42,460
for any type of ensemble based learning

1310
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:44,950
but more importantly none of this is

1311
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:47,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work not just without a</font>

1312
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:49,810
standardized data model because you'll

1313
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:52,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">never get a standardized data model it's</font>

1314
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:55,770
physically impossible right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1315
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:59,890
you've got to take into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account the</font>

1316
01:07:55,770 --> 01:08:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">limitations of protocols and languages</font>

1317
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:06,759
and formats from these different data

1318
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:08,950
sources right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so instead of that</font>

1319
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,160
I actually think you need a standardized

1320
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:14,620
information model and maybe not in a

1321
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:18,160
homogeneous information model but rather

1322
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:21,309
fragments that can be used much like you

1323
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:24,389
use ontology to assemble learning

1324
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:28,240
systems that serve as the base for

1325
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:31,540
different domains so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">group just stop it but we graduation</font>

1327
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:36,670
because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been through information</font>

which Jefferson kindly referenced thank

1336
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:07,569
you um we used models to represent facts

and ontology<font color="#CCCCCC"> zand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first-order logic to</font>

1338
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:13,389
add meaning to those facts so that you

1339
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:16,990
could then build a semantic a grid or

01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:34,020
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to normalize things like IP based</font>
