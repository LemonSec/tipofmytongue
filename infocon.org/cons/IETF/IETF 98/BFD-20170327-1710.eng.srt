different<font color="#CCCCCC"> group ok so this blue sheet</font>

12
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,780
should be circulating around know that

13
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,979
that we need all that often but we could

14
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get a room when we need one</font>

15
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:38,729
so please no solutions so that's next

16
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,620
slide so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the note well you've</font>

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably seen mobile times already this</font>

18
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,090
does actually say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you say</font>

19
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,789
in the mailing list the microphone in a

20
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,380
draft is a contribution towards the IETF

21
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,050
maybe you could understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

22
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,509
please consult your lawyers excite

23
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,830
ladies so in terms of our agenda we're

24
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to just quickly talk about the</font>

25
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,440
status of some lingering things and then

26
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,729
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into gooped Orioles the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

27
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,719
flavor of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for the next</font>

28
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,870
note hour or so is talking about gang

29
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:16,729
and authentication and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

30
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,229
stuff is mostly lingering things slide

31
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,099
so in terms of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in a</font>

32
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,169
zombie<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft state the mpls did is</font>

33
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,628
basically done at this point nobody

34
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,279
sings be super interested in it we still

35
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,590
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clear out some charter stuff</font>

36
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,629
without Alvaro and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

37
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get that off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter at</font>

38
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:39,539
some point the BFD generic

39
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,759
authentication and sha-1 is also in the

40
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,830
zombie state but courtesy of changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

41
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,630
the data tracker<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've now put this in</font>

42
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,940
waiting for implementing and leave it

43
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,009
that way what sort of interesting it's

44
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,760
their content occation may get

45
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,070
resurrected as

46
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:58,170
part of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving day so BFD mol point</font>

47
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,050
is a piece of work that we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">close off you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face multi-point</font>

49
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,820
document does have implementation at

50
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,190
alcatel also has interested several

51
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,320
other vendors so we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

52
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:15,300
push this one through standards the

53
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,400
active<font color="#CCCCCC"> tail document is not basically</font>

54
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know still a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but it's</font>

55
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,020
unlikely to see you know deployment

56
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,470
anytime soon ish our general<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

57
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,469
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish these things ideally</font>

58
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,270
within the next IETF cycle so what we're

59
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,950
going to be doing is looking for a

60
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,039
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> shepherd to pick these things</font>

61
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,969
up when we last talked about this at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF</font>

62
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,380
96<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Greg said he might be interested</font>

63
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,430
so we will their talk to Greg and see if

64
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,020
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually carry this through</font>

65
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,410
as a shepherd or no but for somebody

66
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,820
else that they have time and what will

67
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,910
actually be doing is just running this

68
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,020
through no last<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls will be working</font>

69
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,700
with outfit i'll make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,049
procedure that's documented there no

71
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,270
covers what they're actually doing and

72
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:05,100
this is I etfs chance to say this is a

73
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:06,990
good or bad idea so the draft that Greg

74
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,100
and Jeff come<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sura have been working on</font>

75
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,270
for basically efb<font color="#E5E5E5"> over mopey chassis</font>

76
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,680
which is basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing as VF</font>

77
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,060
p.m. like just the multi chassis

78
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,890
environment had<font color="#E5E5E5"> them presented IETF 96</font>

79
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,140
we had good sense of the room at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

80
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,669
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the work is in scope for the</font>

81
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,150
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know very similar to</font>

82
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:30,390
the VFD em like stuff there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been no</font>

83
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,770
updates it's reasonable material at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

84
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">point we're be doing is putting this to</font>

85
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,449
adoption on the mailing list and we'll

86
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:45,260
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get consensus on that great</font>

87
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:49,400
please a comment be like um

88
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,290
Mirsky city so we had very interesting

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,340
comment and good comment from<font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font>

90
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,390
messenger at the discussion in Berlin

91
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:04,340
referencing a new extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 80 to 1 x</font>

92
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:07,270
black specification with a distributed

93
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,190
resilient network interface there and I

94
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,960
so i looked at specification yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree</font>

95
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:18,500
that that makes MC<font color="#CCCCCC"> lag as we know it has</font>

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,040
a special case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jones suggested</font>

97
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,870
consider bringing this work too I Triple

98
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,390
E so my thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

99
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,570
i truly will be interested in using

100
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,970
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 protocol to monitor layer to</font>

101
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,200
object so the interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

102
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably will work on extending 1731 for</font>

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:47,210
example or CFM but what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like of</font>

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:50,870
others member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community to</font>

105
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:58,580
consider is that if there is an interest

106
00:09:50,870 --> 00:10:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generalize for one using dvd-r and I</font>

107
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:05,600
or MC lag is something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

108
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,880
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address first and see if there</font>

109
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,580
will be implementations of here and I

110
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's much more flexible and more</font>

111
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:19,490
powerful but as a result it's much more

112
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:22,010
complex so I think there's enough

113
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,960
context there that the mailing list is

114
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,700
probably the best place to have this

115
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,470
discussion so if you could basically

116
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,700
frame this in a set of questions for the

117
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss on the mailing</font>

118
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,140
list that that offers advanced this this

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,850
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run into</font>

120
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of headache wit i triple e</font>

121
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,990
before when we're doing the fdm lag in

122
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,790
the first place it's it's obviously a

123
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,230
weird mix between layer 3 and layer 2

124
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:50,510
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just sort of the opposite</font>

125
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:52,490
end of the equation next slide so we're

126
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,760
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into our presentations we've</font>

127
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:59,140
chosen to start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> eft yang which i</font>

128
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,140
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be doing that big</font>

129
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,410
and just in case somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

130
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,300
with minutes you know minutes are

131
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,449
usually pretty easy here we are using

132
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:21,750
the etherpad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

133
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:28,710
helping a to keep the notes can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font>

134
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:31,140
me the good yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm going to</font>

135
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">give an update on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the VFD yang data</font>

136
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:39,990
model next slightly so the changes in

137
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,270
drop 05 since drop 03 we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

138
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">two sets of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that make the first</font>

139
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,960
ones were we fixed the the were compiled

140
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,240
issues in indy 03 version which were

141
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,310
found when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started using new young</font>

142
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:59,960
compilers and also the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

143
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">really was as all many of the other</font>

144
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,830
routing models were doing we were

145
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,110

146
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,240
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the schema not approach where we</font>

147
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,170
define a model and that model can be

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:18,860
mounted in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network instance or at</font>

149
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:24,060
the logical device level also<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

150
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:27,540
routing draft became RFC 8080 22 yep d

151
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,489
is now mounting the base identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

152
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,400
will be fine as a control plane protocol

153
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:36,570
map and i've added the section on

154
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,439
interactions with other en bottoms any

155
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,440
questions on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

156
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,200
what's still not there<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet d / DC cv4 to</font>

157
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,200
the wires so one thing I've been waiting

158
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">for is I think the l2vpn model was going</font>

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fair amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> churn it seems to be</font>

160
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,170
more stable now there's a new version

161
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,480
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> published last week I think</font>

162
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,800
and so one thing we have to decide I

163
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,540
don't if it's something we discuss on

164
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the alias authors or here is whether</font>

165
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:17,279
this model should cover the FDB<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV or</font>

166
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,000
whether we cover that model in a

167
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,830
different gang model and since day one

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,230
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I bfg over</font>

169
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,890
mpls-tp and we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided that we will</font>

170
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,470
not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> covering that in this draft our</font>

171
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,260
pcs up to now we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been said we've said</font>

172
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,360
it's not needed Greg will talk about

173
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,400
echo later where the question of our pcs

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,950
came up again next slide please actually

175
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,480
pause on the slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

176
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:50,279
urgency whether you should wait on the

177
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">VC cv i think the big question is we're</font>

178
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,700
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed to publish yang metals</font>

179
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:59,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see our ad hiding in the back of</font>

180
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:01,140
the room there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer that you so then</font>

181
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">why no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually been pushing us to</font>

182
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,209
get these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> up lished you have any</font>

183
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal sense of note should we just</font>

184
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">get this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing out and put in the</font>

185
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,130
augmentation and later because that is

186
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:17,040
an option with yang or you know should

187
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:19,500
we just close this off a lot of Rosanna

188
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,099
rubbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big yeah who was me I would</font>

189
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,110
you know I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea just say this</font>

190
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,940
have no idea what it means waiting well

191
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,950
to leave you have to firm up how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

192
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,650
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take like so we might be</font>

193
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:37,350
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for a long time so it hurts</font>

194
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:38,760
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just do it additionally ok you</font>

195
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,650
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> so our job is written groups make</font>

196
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,029
sure that the structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> module</font>

197
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,850
is good enough so that we can do the

198
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:47,310
augmentation correct I mean right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

199
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,130
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is is you go to base model</font>

200
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:53,069
and then all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD for each organ type</font>

201
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:55,180
basically augments from there so we

202
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have a separate module where it</font>

203
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,979
yippee for a store I mean I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

204
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,240
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an experimental thing you</font>

205
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,440
know how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work the current</font>

206
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> modeled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get confidence</font>

207
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could work up in the future excited</font>

208
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:19,180
if so things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open issues so</font>

209
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:24,520
there was the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the alias</font>

210
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:26,620
about whether the echo<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmitted</font>

211
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,270
interval was defined properly as being a

212
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,230
kinetic parameter whether that should be

213
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPC so great we'll talk about that it</font>

214
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,420
wrong to me that comes down to the

215
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,070
question is is echo typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> use as</font>

216
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">on-demand or something which is</font>

217
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuous so if anybody has any</font>

218
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,819
comments on that now<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later when Greg</font>

219
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,920
will present please then last not least

220
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,630
it's it's I mean it's not complicated

221
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,430
but basically spending the time to

222
00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:01,300
comply with sixty eighty seven days

223
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:05,199
which we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah next</font>

224
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">one please we also got a bunch of</font>

225
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,380
comments from Jeff last week which will

226
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,610
I think were on board for most of them

227
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,350
will talk about those will have your

228
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,600
address those will have to address the

229
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,460
open issues on the previous slide and I

230
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we go to yang dr. with</font>

231
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:26,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> he only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a month at least you</font>

232
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,699
get the preview I'm sorry it takes at

233
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:36,900
least a month to get someone from young

234
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:36,900
doctor caribian questions concerns

235
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,490
okay nice and straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> form so Greg will</font>

236
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,270
be next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the echo</font>

237
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,270
implications

238
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,219
it

239
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,899
the comment that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes are much</font>

240
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:52,620
redder than mine look at the tiny pond

241
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:54,870
safe yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

242
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:04,969
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two spots first of all it is just</font>

243
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to recapture what RFC 5880 says about</font>

244
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:13,530
VFD echo so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things first a</font>

245
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">BFD echo format the payload of the</font>

246
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:25,280
packet is not determined now what being

247
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:29,720
sent as the echo is open to

248
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,720
implementation it was a proprietary

249
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:45,330
second thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a symmetric so</font>

250
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:50,850
in a symmetric in a way that give<font color="#CCCCCC"> D here</font>

251
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:57,178
note the note advertises only based on a

252
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:59,850
standard are their desired minimum

253
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:04,770
receive interval so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

254
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:10,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">states don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send me anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave the</font>

255
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:13,530
echo more frequently than this when

256
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:19,490
comparing to a synchronous mode with it

257
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,490
advertises minimum receive and transmit

258
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and as a result it's absolutely</font>

259
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:32,040
normal behavior to see that only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

260
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:35,309
VFD peers is using echo while the other

261
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">one is not because for example the other</font>

262
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">side might just say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero which means</font>

263
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,260
which should be interpreted as don't

264
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:49,270
send me any echo

265
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:52,379
ah messages so in another interesting

266
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,379
[Music]

267
00:19:52,900 --> 00:20:00,850
passage or mechanism that described in

268
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,550
5880 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where how</font>

269
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:09,830
difference in<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpretation comes from</font>

270
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:17,690
is that it suggests that sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD</font>

271
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:23,149
echo may be accounted with presence of a

272
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:27,110
synchronous BFD control messages and if

273
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:33,370
echo message is being sent so their rate

274
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:33,370
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD control messages can be reduced</font>

275
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:46,250
accordingly and in current give the yang

276
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:49,070
model their model is such that there are

277
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:52,970
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so the first thing the model</font>

278
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:56,710
includes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit echo interval as</font>

279
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:00,170
part of the configuration which is it

280
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:06,940
persistent configuration and second of

281
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:10,990
all so from my point of view echo is not

282
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:16,040
proactive mechanism as a synchronous

283
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:19,790
being demoed but on demand and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

284
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,159
second slide that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

285
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,560
stress is a difference again in my

286
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,280
interpretation what are proactive and

287
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,950
what on<font color="#E5E5E5"> demand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM is so the practices</font>

288
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,750
you always have persistent configuration

289
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,950
whereas the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on-demand doesn't have</font>

290
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,950
persistent configuration

291
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:49,059
so we had this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start a</font>

292
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:52,119
discussion on a working group list and

293
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,129
then we were soon realize that yes we

294
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:58,029
have a different interpretation of the

295
00:21:54,129 --> 00:22:02,228
mechanism and some of it is to do with

296
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:07,210
this recommendation in 5880 which says

297
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:11,499
that if you using echo give deep then it

298
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:20,169
might reduce me to send control messages

299
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:23,379
as the messages can be accounted i'm not

300
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:26,489
sure that on demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make it</font>

301
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:30,998
absolutely impossible to do this

302
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:34,899
correction of the rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> i though wonder</font>

303
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:39,249
is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the number of</font>

304
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:41,498
messages that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will mean that we reduce</font>

305
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:44,379
the interval and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will change the state</font>

306
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:51,059
machine so interleaving with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ekka</font>

307
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:54,039
messages determination of Thaler becomes

308
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,158
somewhat ambiguous this it's not

309
00:22:54,039 --> 00:23:00,720
deterministic of which one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state</font>

310
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:05,979
machine and what has to really

311
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,389
constitute there Taylor echo mechanism

312
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:14,789
or a synchronous or<font color="#CCCCCC"> composition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invoke</font>

313
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:17,619
my interpretation<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 5880 it's unclear</font>

314
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:21,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a place to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interject</font>

315
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:24,039
you know what we see the real world so

316
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:25,840
with regard to what do you do about the

317
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,340
DFT state machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

318
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,039
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of down negotiates it is part of</font>

319
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,978
running the echo function what we tend

320
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,899
to see in the field is that echo is

321
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:40,509
there to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am taking full</font>

322
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,609
control over whether I consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> my pure</font>

323
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,249
reachable or not simply by the fact that

324
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:47,889
I'm seeing my traffic mutiny my payload

325
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:51,879
is my choice hi verification is my

326
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:53,600
choice so this is taking it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit out of</font>

327
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,939
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> snake machine because it is</font>

328
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,600
now fully under control of the initiator

329
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,690
and I think the FD is requesting is that

330
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session not exceed to give them a</font>

331
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,049
packet for second rate so it is to some

332
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:12,710
extent the choice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation</font>

333
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:15,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">as to what it wants did you get what I</font>

334
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,900
think this does and towards the yang

335

conversation configuration hasn't

337
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,129
changed no we have what the user had put

338
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,270
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it's the tent for know the async</font>

339

session and also for the echo session

340
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,970
operationally you know we're always

341
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,559
going to show what the active state is

342
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,809
know whether you know we've negotiated

343
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,418
our timers down is Carter running the

344

345
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,970
the great that was virtually configured

347
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,799
maybe you could offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> some suggestions</font>

348
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,840
on is when we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> this no down</font>

349
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,760
negotiation we can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

350
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,379
the settings of the async session

00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,379
whether or not the echo function has any

sort of representation<font color="#CCCCCC"> operational state</font>

353
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,970
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's there right now I</font>

354
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,610
can't tell that echo is actually in

355
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,830
progress I can't tell what it happens to

356
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,620
think about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

357
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is left explicitly out of the spec as a</font>

358
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,539
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about this which</font>

359
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,449
makes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

360
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:23,090
standardized yang module I think what we

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:27,650
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to expose is echo function</font>

363
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,090
implementation wants to augment the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dfb</font>

364

module to say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what it's</font>

365
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,020
injecting that's great that I think

366
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:40,840
that's probably in the space of a vendor

367
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:44,690
augmentation technology um right<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

368
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:49,330
stepping<font color="#CCCCCC"> back original discussion</font>

369
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:52,429
started that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit interval</font>

370
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:55,340
whether it's part of persistent

371
00:25:52,429 --> 00:26:02,799
configuration before it's a part of our

372
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:04,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">PC even if we extend it further is that</font>

373
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,700
initiating at

374
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:11,480
session ah is it the part of

375
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:15,200
configuration has been able disabled or

376
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's important part so I think in terms</font>

377
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,390
of the management editing so the egg

378
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,840
module that we're talking about it's an

379
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">inherent property of the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user so I</font>

380
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,889
would not expect to be up to

381
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:32,900
implementation to prod the yang mult

382
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:34,880
initiate a echo activity is its way of

383
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,980
interacting with BF d now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be</font>

384
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,350
something the internal software into the

385
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,600
place where you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose this in</font>

386
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang module is if you expect the end</font>

387
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,159
users use the management claim to

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,710
actually initiate something so in the

389
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,470
case of something like spfd which is

390
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:53,480
really on demand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might make sense</font>

391
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,550
and you know spfd functions are not

392
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really covered strongly inside of the</font>

393
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,240
gang module at this point we know those

394
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,320
would probably could be something we

395
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:07,040
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> augment at a later point so I</font>

396
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">think my observation would be this sort</font>

397
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,879
of on-demand behavior triggered by the

398
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,290
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane it's probably otoscope</font>

399
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,179
for what we're trying to do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

400
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,639
first round of things but as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

401
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:21,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about spfd may be excited the muses</font>

402
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:26,179
event actually as you bring up SBB

403
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:31,070
because there is a certain dependency as

404
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:33,490
BFD to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP from its dependent on</font>

406
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:45,800
one way of really advertising

407

00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:57,980
provisioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

409
00:27:52,340 --> 00:28:01,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up this question of echo maybe</font>

410
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:05,890
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion because you see</font>

411
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,500
whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could transfer</font>

412
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:13,280
part of persistent configuration or of

413
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,990
something else and I fortunately I think

414
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,300
it's out of scope but it is definitely a

415
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:21,960
good place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vendor application</font>

416
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">then so you will consider is that to</font>

417
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">being not in the base model okay that I</font>

418
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:37,649
would you okay thanks for your bringing

419
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:39,740
up the topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I think holding on to</font>

420
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,520
our next slide so we're entering the

421
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,860
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our session where we're</font>

422
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,290
talking about if the authentication and

423
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,699
things they'll be being used for our

424
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,000
first presentation from that will be

425
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,000
subtle

426
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:11,180
just a microphone everyone so um today

427
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll be talking about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you</font>

428
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">will do if you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out take a bell</font>

429
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:24,429
or lower in the Lord so today I'll be

430
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:29,390
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an enhancement to RFC 5880</font>

431
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:33,770
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons we have this</font>

432
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:36,380
enhancement is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5818 states that the</font>

433
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:42,350
authentication is done on the entire

434
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:47,270
packet if we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> key 10 B 5 of food</font>

435
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">sha-1 other but and the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font>

436
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:53,600
it states is that the sequence number is

437
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:56,480
exposed in every DFT packet so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

438
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,080
an enhancement we're making to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

439
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,700
security of the faculty or that states

440
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,409
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to authenticate</font>

441
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,080
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> package because it's expensive</font>

442
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,530
when packets comment line great it's

443
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,649
expensive to decode the authentication

444
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:15,020
on the entire packet and we can

445
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,610
authenticate<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of the packet and the</font>

446
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,160
part of the package that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

447
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,080
tentative<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the sequence number so we</font>

448
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,210
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what</font>

449
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,210
this graph talked about and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

450
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,910
authentication is not on the whole

451
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">package it is just on the sequence</font>

452
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,040
number and how we can hide the sequence

453
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:43,250
number from all intruders so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

454
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:45,139
reason for this enhancement so so the

455
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,250
problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sequence numbers</font>

456
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:51,440
increase monotonically so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

457
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,440
becomes very predictable what the next

458
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,690
sequence number is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so when</font>

459
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,030
that happens it's easy for the man<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

460
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,110
the middle to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring down the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PFD session</font>

461
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:07,010
or take control of the deity session so

462
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:10,330
in order to avoid this we've come up

463
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,330
with a proposal

464
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,850
ok so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level algorithm is that</font>

465
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:23,930
you take your sequence number which is

466
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:25,939
increasing and you push it through a

467
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:30,620
hash algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a symmetric</font>

468
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:33,380
32-bit hash algorithm when you hash the

469
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,250
sequence number in the hash algorithm

470
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:40,610
with a shared key the sequence number is

471
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,460
now hidden from anyone who tries to

472
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">intercept the package so instead of</font>

473
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">placing the sequence number in the</font>

474
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,570
sequence number field<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet you</font>

475
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,690
place the hashed value in the sequence

476
00:31:50,570 --> 00:32:00,080
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> accounts so that's the</font>

477
00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:03,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so basically you</font>

478
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,230
provision a hash algorithm and a shaky

479
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:11,060
securely on the sender and the receiver

480
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:13,790
and this has to be a symmetric hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

481
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,280
the reason is that the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

482
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:20,930
perform the reverse hash on what the

483
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:24,920
sender did so the sender encodes the

484
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:29,990
sequence number using the shared key and

485
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:32,300
the hash and the receiver decodes the

486
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:38,030
sequence number using the reverse hash

487
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:42,590
and the shake the expected sequence

488
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,420
number will match the decoded value and

489
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:49,820
the receiver now knows what they

490
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:52,520
expected sequence number would be if the

491
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,260
sequence number is match up using the

492
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,970
reverse hash then you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

493
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:03,500
it is good otherwise you know that the

494
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:05,360
packet is a bad product so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

495
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,790
an example this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an example</font>

496
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,820
on all the sequence numbers that would

497
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:14,780
have individuals so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> help we have what</font>

498
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:18,220
RFC 1558 uses so it uses increasing

499
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:21,320
sequence numbers and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

500
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:24,380
hash with a shake either just<font color="#E5E5E5"> random</font>

501
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,230
numbers I chose is to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

502
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,350
the the array the<font color="#E5E5E5"> low is basically the</font>

503
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:42,890
sequence number when completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hash</font>

504
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:46,399
with a shape so in 1580 you have the

505
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:50,240
hash on the whole packet which when you

506
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,250
have to decode the hash it's expensive

507
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,250
because it's on the whole packet but

508
00:33:52,250 --> 00:34:02,200
here this is just on a 32-bit value that

509
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:05,950
is hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all attacks now it it</font>

510
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,270
provides a level of security because

511
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,639
intruders will not be able to detect the

512
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:18,159
sequence number and hence won't be able

513
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:18,159
to bring down the VNC session so the

514
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">there there two things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been achieved</font>

515
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,940
here you're not hashing the whole packet

516
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,159
your action only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sequence number and</font>

517
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:31,100
you're also protecting the sequence

518
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:39,889
number from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> extends from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mall</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">into a broader discussion is after the</font>

00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,040
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> slightly out or the agenda and</font>

524
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:53,509
what should hopefully become a parent

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,779
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the update is this</font>

526
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,610
mechanism is intended to address the one

527
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,160
of the problems that we had when we were

528
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,320
sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know unauthenticated the FD</font>

531
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,080
occasionally without actually making

00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,950

presentation

537
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:26,000
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here if I have a comment this is</font>

538
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,520
when you say without authentication here

539
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,500
this is assuming the Nullification tlv

540
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,730
of the optimizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

541
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,440
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend to have this as</font>

543
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">can also make use of this like this</font>

544
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:48,379
point and what sort of worth pointing

545
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,110
out is that this mechanism can be used

546
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,990
outside of the FD know basically one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

547
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:56,390
the genetic problems IETF has is if you

548
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:59,149
want to make sure that you have some

549
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,190
piece of high volume data<font color="#E5E5E5"> PFD being an</font>

550
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,560
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of that where you</font>

551
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,800
can't afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an actual hardcore</font>

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,950
crew neck action like no sha wan xiao xu

553
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,860
et cetera that this mechanism for data

554
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,410
that has a short<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifespan may actually</font>

555
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:21,800
be a good way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide no eating great</font>

556
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:31,490
security well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let's proceed to</font>

557
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:35,300
the optimizing presentation we do

558
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,660
performances take some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it these</font>

559
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">two things</font>

560
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so this is an update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

561
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:53,410
draft that we have been discussing in

562
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,510
VFD for some time as Jeff mentioned one

563
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,930
of the action items that we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font>

564
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,869
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last presentation was the</font>

565
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:06,240
question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with our nothing</font>

566
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:08,859
to gated packets that we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that</font>

567
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,529
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to essentially</font>

568
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:14,140
authenticate every packet and we can bet

569
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:18,130
the remaining packets going here so I'll

570
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:23,980
come to that and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> solos draw kind of</font>

571
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:25,750
fits into this so just the other update

572
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,369
is of course the consideration are

573
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,210
behind our consideration that are not

574
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:34,570
lost i believe in right now so we are

575
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:41,590
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an addition or not allowed in</font>

576
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:44,020
that makes likely so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal</font>

577
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:48,460
that we had made which suggested that

578
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:51,869
only a<font color="#E5E5E5"> beefy packet that is actually</font>

579
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,650
going to make a state change should be

580
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Authenticator or needs to be</font>

581
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,380
authenticated that the remaining packets

582
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,740
that do not indicate any state change

583
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,750
can go in the clear but that brought up

584
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,629
the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens if someone</font>

585
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:11,109
actually takes over a session at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

586
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:15,660
point I seeing the Packers going there

587
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:19,930
and tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring the session down</font>

588
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:22,149
there this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so the action was one of</font>

589
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,609
the recommendation poster for us to say

590
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,200
every so often we'll go and authenticate

591
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:29,140
one of those packets just to make sure

592
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> possession hasn't been taken over</font>

593
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:36,040
home that's only as good as we do it in

594
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:40,750
enough frequently enough that we

595
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:48,550
somebody can't get in the middle next

596
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:52,330
slide please so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where on the</font>

597
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:55,469
suggestion of taking what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already our</font>

598
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:59,649
tunnel presented in terms of birth

00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:03,779
using be meticulous sequence number and

600
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:08,078
saying that if we were to hide or a

601
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:10,329
bunch the sequence number then we would

602
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,609
be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to prevent the man</font>

603
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:17,349
in the middle attack in the cases where

604
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:24,489
the packet is going into clear on next

605
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:26,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide so pretty much as I said the draft</font>

606
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:29,259
has been stable except to deal with this

607
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:32,319
particular action item that we had about

608
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:33,939
the beam but sequence numbers and we

609
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,519
believe at this point of those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

610
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:38,519
document is ready for lost all questions

611
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:50,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gregory ett so my question is that in a</font>

612
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:54,538
draft so you indicate that one of the

613
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:59,229
possible modes when their sessions up is

614
00:39:54,539 --> 00:40:04,089
to use authentication with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some periodic</font>

615
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:07,538
thinner trigger sorry say that again to

616
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:11,139
use I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the authentication as a</font>

617
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:14,199
timer trigger so basically ever so often

618
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:17,109
to send the packet with authentication

619
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:19,959
that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the option and that is</font>

620
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:23,919
because authenticate in each<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every</font>

621
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:26,799
packet is computationally challenging

622
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:30,939
though when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about hardware-based</font>

623
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:34,109
via the implementation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

624
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">there then the idea would be is that</font>

625
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:43,449
verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> of authentication is</font>

626
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:48,339
uploaded from their polling engine ok

627
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:50,679
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> raises the question is when we</font>

628
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:55,029
say that the received packet with an

629
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:57,869
authentication being validate when we

630
00:40:55,029 --> 00:41:01,929
complete authentication verification or

631
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:03,040
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just verify some portion of the</font>

632
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:05,800
pack

633
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,880
it is then the packet is completely

634
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:12,760
authentic ated<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but that affects</font>

635
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,720
their state machine because I can

636
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:20,260
envision that the rate of sending

637
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,700
packets it's quite aggressive yeah but

638
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,100
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a straight change</font>

639
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,339
you're not under<font color="#E5E5E5"> out McDonald but you</font>

640
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,589
indicated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible to use</font>

641
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:30,790
authentication when the state is up

642
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,250
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay examiner it's only</font>

643
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:36,610
occasionally every one sec right but

644
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:40,330
occasionally every so often so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

645
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,970
sending the packet and then let's assume

646
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,910
that after this packet being shipped for

647
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:50,410
syndication verification we lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

648
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:57,520
packets in a row<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so which will</font>

649
00:41:50,410 --> 00:42:00,359
cause a stick drop two down because if a

650
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:06,040
syndication takes more than time then

651
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:08,110
receiving to Beckett no well yeah so say

652
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,870
say you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to authenticate in</font>

653
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,940
time because packet right yes we but you

654
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">received two packets off no no I don't</font>

655
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive I drop I lost if i could i think</font>

656
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg is suggesting that in a</font>

657
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware based implementation if you're</font>

658
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,290
trying to keep the authentication of the

659
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:30,130
hardcore authentication in line on the

660
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:31,990
line card the action of doing that they

661
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:36,520
burn enough resources that it causes a

662
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:40,229
cough drops no but what no it's not no

663
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,550
blood smear I imagine that it's like a

664
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,650
authentication as a bump in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire so</font>

665
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,850
a tent<font color="#CCCCCC"> occation gratification being</font>

666
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:51,130
shipped to control plane and I have a

667
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:55,990
high rate of packets so let's say

668
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:58,150
running at 3.3 millisecond and let's

669
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:01,029
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane it's so busy it</font>

670
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:07,120
cannot get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this packets in</font>

671
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next seven milliseconds but so</font>

672
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,450
happens that the next to be a package

673
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's supposed to be processed by</font>

674
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:18,200
hardware

675
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:20,240
that was so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have I have one</font>

676
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,480
packet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still waiting processing</font>

677
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,589
and two packets being lost so I'm out of

678
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">my death interval true yeah so in that</font>

679
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:33,590
particular scenario you're left with no

680
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:37,970
option but to bring the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog yes</font>

681
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you think that it doesn't have</font>

682
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:44,689
to somehow change their validation

683
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,860
scheme so that leaves this packet that

684
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:51,380
being accepted and sent for

685
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,710
authentication validation gets counted

686
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,530
as a valid packet well one possible

687
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:00,860
implementation and I don't know is that

688
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you bring the session down if you</font>

689
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,930
already have a packet that you know is

690
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:08,630
waiting authentication completion can

691
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:12,740
you but<font color="#CCCCCC"> II made on that yeah but if</font>

692
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:15,140
single authenticated packet fails to be

693
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,270
validated<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that bring the session</font>

694
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,509
down because again it's not in a

695
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:29,720
document okay in did you have a comment

696
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:32,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mine hesitate because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

697
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">awhile since I've read this but so I'm</font>

698
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,240
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from memory right rather than</font>

699
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,310
the document but it's a authentication

700
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,759
is essentially a separate process you

701
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:46,370
just keep receiving the packets and if

702
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,740
they look right you assume the session

703
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,779
is still up at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get around</font>

704
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to validating whether or not the FN</font>

705
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,750
occation is correct you go oh damn

706
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a problem that happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

707
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">while ago let's take it down or let's</font>

708
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,279
set off an alarm that's the only trigger

709
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:03,529
that is associated with the detection of

710
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,060
an authentication problem mm-hmm and and

711
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,090
and you just keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going I don't</font>

712
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:11,259
understand Greg<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're and maybe</font>

713
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,260
I've just misunderstood you

714
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,089
you're not blocking on anything if you

715
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,879
have to lose two and you're counting for

716
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:23,470
three then you keep going so you don't

717
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:26,440
get three yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm assuming that if</font>

718
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:30,459
you're using your indication that you

719
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:34,619
aren't dependent you encrypt the whole

720
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:37,210
pack the whole be of demons so only

721
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:39,069
putting a checksum on the package not

722
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:43,150
actually encrypting it unless you

723
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gian I</font>

724
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,809
think what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg is referring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

725
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,328
previous option he's not referring to

726
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:52,150
the suggested changes that we're making

727
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:55,480
he you know previous option we had

728
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,880
recommended that every so often every

729
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,299
one second as a suggestion we would

730
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,730
encrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pack and in that case what</font>

731
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:06,970
Garriga saying is that the timer<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

732
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,740
expire therefore the system will have no

733
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:14,140
option but<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring the session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of and I</font>

734
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:17,140
accept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument so let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> convert</font>

735
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:21,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just curious this discussion assumes</font>

736
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,960
that it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical problem that</font>

737
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:25,509
authentication cannot be completed

738
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,660
within the session whole time that is

739
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:31,569
that a realistic problem every does

740
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not specifically</font>

741
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:36,970
that problem it's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same thing</font>

742
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:39,400
every three point three milliseconds you

743
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,529
know so but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's an elaboration if it</font>

744
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,630
doesn't arrive rio salado and that's why

745
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:46,119
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal to say let's not do</font>

746
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,880
that on every packet but every nth

747
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,069
packet and now you're saying gee what

748
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,950
happens if I lose the other end packets

749
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:56,140
and I'm asking instead of practical I

750
00:46:52,950 --> 00:47:00,839
just won't say that usually you might

751
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:04,990
have thousands of feedback sessions so

752
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:07,210
yeah so due to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument a guy ok</font>

753
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,758
I'll I should have last time to what

754
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,650
he's saying it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that it's an</font>

755
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:13,599
authentication is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

756
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,789
packet is taking more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than people in</font>

757
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">three milliseconds it's actually taking</font>

758
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:21,670
nine point nine milliseconds for the

759
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:24,549
authentication to succeed before for you

760
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,540
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to say oh I Kiva's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost</font>

761
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:27,130
three packets

762
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,900
now if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to authentic</font>

763
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,060
authentic<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 the packet in nine point</font>

764
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,770
nine milliseconds and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're totally</font>

765
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:36,220
out of luck you probably shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

766
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:40,330
be doing authentication to begin with no

767
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:43,600
but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> uni monster hardware right</font>

768
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:47,620
prevalence yeah the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

769
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,710
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about multiple concurrent give</font>

770
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,930
these sessions which is usually the case

771
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but the same argument meaning if if</font>

772
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:58,720
you truly if your hardware is not

773
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">capable of authenticating in every nth</font>

774
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,669
packet then you probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> should but</font>

775
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,900
again the premise of this word is that

776
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:12,660
yes we realize that authentication is

777
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:12,660
expensive and we want to somehow do it

778
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,840
theoretically not every peg<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

779
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,510
that's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if performance is</font>

780
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,000
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem then why we do it</font>

781
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,160
theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we not authenticate</font>

782
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,170
each and every tech<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right i know</font>

783
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,720
for a fact that authenticating every

784
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:36,370
packet at 3.3 million seconds is a

785
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:39,100
problem what we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is that if</font>

786
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:43,210
indicated every nth packet is a problem

787
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:45,910
I agree we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be proposing this if we</font>

788
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:49,120
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do any authentication at all</font>

789
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:52,779
at wire speed I can I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> assure you is</font>

790
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:55,540
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a problem authenticating</font>

791
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:59,110
every packet and we start authenticating

792
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,150
every one packet in a thousand then with

793
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:07,660
a thousand sessions it still will be a

794
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:10,840
problem so this to me is it's a scale

795
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:13,240
problem forget about authentication for

796
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,100
a particular hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can support and</font>

797
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,259
sessions that might be 10 that might be

798
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,089
hundred there might be a thousand so now

799
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,160
we're increasing the cost of supporting

800
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,140
a session that<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly affects your</font>

801
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,569
scale so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware they could</font>

802
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,330
support a thousand unauthenticated

803
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,920
sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> could only support one hundred</font>

804
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:33,700
authenticated section together<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

805
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,280
not free it's not obviously three but

806
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:39,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that we are changing the</font>

807
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,660
flow of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet so in a system</font>

808
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,118
because if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have indicate each and</font>

809
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:48,770
every packet then the processing of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

810
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,420
packets and validation is friendship so

811
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:53,390
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are shipping authentication</font>

812
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere else are floating then we are</font>

813
00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:00,009
changing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> suppression okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

814
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:02,900
so they're not a man and jabber from

815
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically on this point let him get</font>

816
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,170
his words<font color="#CCCCCC"> in jail so in Hardware</font>

817
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,540
implementations the sequence number

818
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,640
option will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better fit compared to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

819
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:13,099
scenario where indication is not in mine

820
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,049
in any case authentication of the

821
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:18,140
offloaded frame is not related to the

822
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:20,720
subsequent frames so more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one</font>

823
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,400
person's making the point that even if

824
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,169
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing the path through which</font>

825
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,910
the authentication stuff flows you know

826
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,400
doing the fast stuff in line doing the

827
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:32,029
expensive stuff potentially on a

828
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,920
different engine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental</font>

829
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,920
property that you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is can you</font>

830
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,960
actually do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in a timely</font>

831
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,970
fashion for the scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

832
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at and as you start know this is</font>

833
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:45,950
a multi-dimensional problem as know the

834
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,920
FD always is if you increase the numbers

835
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:51,078
on one thing you change know what you

836
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,240
scale on the other ones so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you could</font>

837
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,819
support authenticating one out of n

838
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,618
that's great but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greg points out if</font>

839
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,759
you make end big enough you'll

840
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,680
eventually run into enough of

841
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,230
indications happening potentially at the

842
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,690
same time because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some level of</font>

843
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:07,339
headache one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the FD tries to</font>

844
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:10,069
give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation a</font>

845
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:14,029
little bit is we're expected to buy

846
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:16,460
jittered I think one place that we might

847
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,960
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better descriptive in</font>

848
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,049
our question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the periodic</font>

849
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,960
authentication is some way to maybe make

850
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:26,420
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that jitter applies to that</font>

851
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,270
type of behavior so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up self</font>

852
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,130
synchronizing sounds good so that's

853
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:38,839
something somewhere you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> lab for the</font>

854
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">gun okay all right so we'll make those</font>

855
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:46,250
changes and resubmit the draft or

856
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:48,440
consideration allowable the question

857
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,839
which only been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked before has there</font>

858
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,200
been any experimentation in terms of

859
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:55,049
what kind of

860
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,259
we can scale x times better with this as

861
00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:02,310
opposed to what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it's um not</font>

862
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:05,160
specifically with authentic this form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

863
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:07,890
authentication the difference between no

864
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:12,210
authentication and full authentication

865
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:14,759
was I believe one in five so the numbers

866
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:20,190
dropped<font color="#CCCCCC"> one fifth if you for the dough</font>

867
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,750
for authentication so in terms of the

868
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,520
actions that come out of this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

869
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably slightly premature on</font>

870
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,240
last call you did the procedures I think

871
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,399
are well understood you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

872
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,939
matter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we hold in the</font>

873
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,119
procedures from sonals draft to cover

874
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,050
the situation's we knew where<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

875
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,540
some of that includes you know how we

876
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:42,150
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the initial sequence number</font>

877
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,680
discovery in order to be able to do the

878
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:47,040
hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequence numbers for the</font>

879
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases worth buying that mechanism so I</font>

880
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think we're ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for last call</font>

881
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:53,250
but no certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> after integration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

882
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably are what this does mean is that</font>

883
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:59,550
now we would as part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work also</font>

884
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,529
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take up sonals draft is you know</font>

885
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,240
basically dependent draft and therefore

886
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:08,640
make it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brick your baptism is that</font>

887
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:11,060
what you're looking for yes via I assume

888
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,160
so but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you always have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

889
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,078
so what we'll be doing is part of you

890
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,700
know the post-meeting stuff is putting

891
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">out an adoption call for this make sure</font>

892
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,560
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> briton group agrees and</font>

893
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,770
hopefully we probably said it for about

894
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,569
two weeks after I ETF is complete and

895
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:30,150
the two of you can sort of work together

896
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:32,640
on making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that no your solos draft</font>

897
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,800
is actually covering procedures know

898
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,210
that are sort of generic and your draft

899
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is covering how to actually integrate</font>

900
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:42,119
those procedures this all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit</font>

901
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:45,480
problem right can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be optimizing dropped</font>

902
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,160
go to last call without the sequence

903
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,589
number of Fisk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shin you're going to</font>

904
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,440
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that if you're actually going</font>

905
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:54,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font>

906
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:58,940
guys so it will probably get held up in

907
00:53:54,829 --> 00:54:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISC or whatever ask all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fading force</font>

908
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:05,750
holds back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> beach a similar state yeah</font>

909
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:07,609
so in terms of publication it does mean

910
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,559
that both graphs must advance together

911
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:11,299
because they have a normative and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

912
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">see on each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other some more importantly</font>

913
00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:15,559
we can't last call optimizing until we

914
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:19,900
actually have the procedure making use

915
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,900
of this mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nail down back to</font>

916
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:30,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last run okay so we're on our last</font>

917
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:41,180
presentation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a update on the DFT</font>

918
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:44,450
performance mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this</font>

919
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:46,339
is an individual draft and the questions

920
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:49,220
raised in the last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> were related</font>

921
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:50,720
to several questions actually how the

922
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,959
delay measurement was going to take

923
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">place where was the values going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

924
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:01,250
stored to see both sender how the two

925
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:03,890
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get correlated so that and</font>

926
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:06,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other was what impact if any it</font>

927
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:10,299
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on the optimizer draft that</font>

928
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:12,920
we just discussed next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please so</font>

929
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:15,079
with all those the considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

930
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,770
considering that it really wasn't trying

931
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:20,750
to solve a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that</font>

932
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:23,680
people already didn't know we decided to

933
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:28,940
drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the delay measurement calculation</font>

934
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:32,058
but keep these you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum up the</font>

935
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:34,640
validity count and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were any</font>

936
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:37,579
DFT packets getting dropped in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> VIP</font>

937
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,410
session and using that as a mechanism to

938
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:42,020
figure out whether the deity session was

939
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:46,190
stable it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much there and</font>

940
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:48,890
you see quality and ability to use that

941
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,200
to figure out our predict whether

942
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:54,520
they're going to be a network event that

943
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:58,058
might ultimately bring the VAP session

944
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,059
next slightly

945
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:05,868
we believe having dropped that and made

946
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:08,569
a very simple drop all about counting

947
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:13,010
sequence numbers and making sure whether

948
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:15,829
that is a is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough indication of</font>

949
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,849
the state of the BFD and of the network

950
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:27,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we believe that it has some value</font>

951
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:30,170
to be considered as a vodka<font color="#CCCCCC"> file any</font>

952
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:31,970
questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on the APFT</font>

953
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,609
performance this does clear out one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the security concerns that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>
