69
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:38,979
way back when about meeting 12 or 13 I

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,690
need to go look it up we had longest

71
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,490
ever working group session we've ever

72
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,349
had it started about eight o'clock in

73
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,370
the morning and ran but till about two

74
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:51,789
o'clock next day 2 a.m. the next day it

75
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:56,349
was the host requirements document our

77
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:00,219

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,949
interesting and useful documents even as

79
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:06,069
old as they are but some of the choices

80
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:10,330
that are in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> document were fueled by</font>

81
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:15,879
basically complete exhaustion more than

82
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,198
reasonable reasonable choices I'm going

83
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little bit about just what the</font>

84
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,330

88
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,889
talk a little bit of about our culture

89
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,719
and the IDF does have a culture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

90
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,360
important for you to understand what's

organized activity of the internet

society that wasn't always the case the

116
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,350
IETF started out strangely enough as an

117
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,680
engineering organization it's now a

118
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,260
standard organization originally it was

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,690
an engineering organization design that

120
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,260
had the purpose of getting the NASA

127
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,720
together about meeting 10 we turned into

128
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,670
a standards development organization and

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,070
the internet changed from a us-centric

130
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:18,190
US government centric or thing into

131
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:21,040
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was much broader 30 years</font>

144
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,279
rested in one if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

145
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:54,459
working group or a topic chances are

146
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,499
that topic is shared by other things in

147
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same area so if you're dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

148
00:08:56,499 --> 00:09:00,279
say for example TLS you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

149
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at authentication authorization</font>

150
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,220
in the security area<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you're</font>

151
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,199
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP transport control</font>

152
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,970
protocol you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go and have a</font>

153
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:15,219
talk with the transport area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> setp</font>

154
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,470
session control transport protocol so

155
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,610
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our stands for work is</font>

156
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,259
done by the working groups and that's

157
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,749
again where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably spend most</font>

158
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:27,730
your time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of your time with the</font>

159
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:29,429
ITF won't be spent in the meetings it

160
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,410
will be spent on the mailing list

161
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:35,050
conversing writing documents and then

162
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:39,009
coming the IETF meetings to discuss what

163
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,769
you've been doing we are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also see a</font>

164
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:46,749
group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wandering around oh</font>

165
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:56,199
thank you please I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot</font>

166
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:58,329
microphones oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently I'm</font>

167
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:05,139
not swapping microphones yet ooh that

168
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:07,420
level is high I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think okay so we know</font>

169
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:11,679
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not good it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding back end</font>

170
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:14,618
okay um so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet architecture</font>

171
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:19,899
board is also an organized activity of

172
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:21,429
the Internet Society it we are sibling

173
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,829
organization with them that in some ways

174
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:26,410
they for our standards things they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

175
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,849
an externally facing organization that's

176
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:32,769
where all the liaisons and things like

177
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,480
that go so you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see them wandering</font>

178
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,699
around here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they they will be</font>

179
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,350
participating<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IETF plenary and</font>

180
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,829
giving a description of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

181
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,029
external<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF in some ways um</font>

182
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,339
there's a bunch more stuff that we will

183
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,809
tell that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could learn but most of it</font>

184
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:50,679
is not immediately important to you for

185
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:52,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">this meeting so um always ask questions</font>

186
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:56,999
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need the questions answered but</font>

187
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:56,998
don't sweat the small details for now

188
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you true to that</font>

189

[Music]

190
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,010
how's that one-two-three-four-five

191
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:35,360
one-two-three-four-five

192
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,670
one-two-three-four-five can you guys

193
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear me on the back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool and you've</font>

194
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,860
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good level for recording cool ok</font>

195
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:46,040
so the IHF like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a standard</font>

196
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,390
standards development organization you

197
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,069
can't just develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> though you need to</font>

198
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure it's useful uniquely sure it's</font>

199
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,500
manageable at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point in time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

200
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,490
internet consisted of something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:03,140
networks and 700 computers that was 30

202
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,730
years ago it's much worse now if we

203
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,459
didn't build something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was scalable</font>

204
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,350
and manageable we would basically have

205
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,750
gone out of business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the entire</font>

206
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,279
internet would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fallen over so this</font>

207
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what this organization was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

208
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,700
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can</font>

209
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,439
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale we continue to be</font>

210
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,209
manageable we continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a useful</font>

211
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have</font>

212
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,099
participating other standards

213
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,850
development organizations like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO or</font>

214
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,580
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> five system that's not</font>

215
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys most you</font>

216
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,279
guys won't have to unlearn anything if

217
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,079
the IETF is kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

218
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,150
organization we expect you to

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,950
participate as individuals you're not

220
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,180
here as representatives your company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

221
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">although your companies are probably</font>

222
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,439
paying for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would guess we are self</font>

223
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,140
selected individual participants we do

224
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
things in many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom-up we pick</font>

225
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,830
good ideas or ideas we think that are

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,750
good and then try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out whether</font>

227
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not a standard makes sense with</font>

228
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect to that there's no formal voting</font>

229
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,190
I'll talk a little bit about how we come

230
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,500
to conclusions later on we have no

231
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,240
formal government role we're not charger

232
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,770
by the United States government we're

233
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,690
not part of something like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> key or ISO</font>

234
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,880
traditionalized stos generally have some

235
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,980
form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of formal voting that generally</font>

236
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,839
have organizational numbers sometimes

237
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers but that's</font>

238
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,740
fairly rare and sometimes the

239
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:33,380
memberships are based on the country

240
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:35,959
you're in so they also have kind of

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,200
wider set of things to deal with than we

242
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,018
do you can have standards organizations

243
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,179
that deal with in

244
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,129
were threads on a screw there's actually

245
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,800
a standards organization that that has a

246
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:50,040
rest that defines the the standard

247
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,819
recipe for a fruitcake seriously

248
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,819
fruitcake um they are mostly top down

249
00:13:53,819 --> 00:14:01,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually top down and they are sometimes</font>

250
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:03,299
legally or treaty mandated<font color="#E5E5E5"> or sometimes</font>

251
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,189
you have to comply with them because

252
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,910
that's what the law says we're mostly

253
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:10,920
not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that space we will be different</font>

254
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,860
than those organizations so if you have

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,360
if you were expecting us to be like them

256
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:21,209
throw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start over pretty</font>

257
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,790
informal um occasionally you'll see

258
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,449
people which coats and ties here you

259
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,040
know we don't we occasionally cut off

260
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:33,719
their ties but that hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened for</font>

261
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,389
a few years we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart and we aren't</font>

262
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,949
pinion dated and if you're here and

263
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:40,980
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful you will probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

264
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:42,929
in both of those categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some of</font>

265
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,350
the people here are blunt they don't

266
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:51,799
mean to be rude<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

268
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,529
we you're gonna have to adapt to it if

269
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are coming in and expecting your way</font>

270
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,999
to be the way it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the case</font>

271
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:05,009
over time as you participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font>

272
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:07,860
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change our culture but it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

273
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,139
a while don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect that what you think</font>

274
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,819
is right should what you think should be

275
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,540
writing is actually right in the context

276
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,949
of the IETF now I put this last sentence

277
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,779
here just to explain something

278
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,099
occasionally we get people especially

279
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,929
the ones who have dealt with other

280
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,509
standards organization coming in here in

281
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,769
a group to present an idea that they

282
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:31,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to standardize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

283
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:34,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet we look for good technical</font>

284
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:36,779
ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dumb</font>

285

429
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,640
the hallways meanings are really useful

437
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,489
go forward in the idea you'll get these

438
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,500
people saying here's a barb off all that

439
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,500
is is an informal gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people it</font>

440
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,820
is sometimes in a bar on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

441
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,170
sometimes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's in the bar</font>

442
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,990
sometimes it's hosted which means

443
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,520
they'll buy the beer so you know look

444
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,180
look out for those sometimes you'll find

445
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,820
them honey um if you're wandering around

446
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel or go or the the conference</font>

447
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,470
area occasionally you'll find clusters

448
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,750
of people usually all facing inwards six

449
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,240
seven eight nine ten people typing away

450
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,890
roughly marathoning sessions please

451
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,210
leave the people alone unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

452
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,780
what the session is about they're

453
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,660
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube will be there at some</font>

454
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,790
point along the way

455
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:43,140
but we get a we get a lot of that going

456
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,760
on it the we use this time to interact

457
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,560
very quickly and get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things</font>

458
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,150
done in a very short period of time and

459
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,710
again sometimes the informal stuff is

460
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,680
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important than actual formal stuff</font>

461
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,270
is in there there are three different

462
00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:00,510
ways of getting the agenda there's two

463
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:02,010
URLs and the two then and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

464
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,850

466
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,000
make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the app the app is</font>

467
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,440
your friend use it the the data tracker

468
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,060
is your friend use all of this stuff

469
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,500
will help you understand what's going on

470
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,730
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group meeting if you're</font>

471
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,320
going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a working group meeting</font>

472
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,790
one of the most important things you can

473
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,010
do is take a look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

474
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group and sometimes take a quick</font>

475
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,220
look at least at the abstracts of the

476
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,620
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going to be discussed</font>

477
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,080
so all that should be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

478
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,080
the through the tool so you have here

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,220
what happens

566
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,050
is you had an idea the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

567
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting says yeah you were going this</font>

568
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,560
direction we think we need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over on</font>

569
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,170
this direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get completely</font>

570
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,820
redone and you read three spending ideas

571
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,340
and you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this direction</font>

572
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,149
later on so again that's fairly rare

573
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,439
I'll occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one shot birds of</font>

574
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,020
a feather<font color="#CCCCCC"> xand those will be something</font>

575
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a topic that is timely for example</font>

576
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:35,170
the involvement in the IETF and privacy

577
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:36,639
in internet privacy becomes could have

578
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,810
been one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things it's not</font>

579
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can put into</font>

580
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,510
standards as a general standards group

581
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,850
but it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that you want to</font>

582
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:48,640
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about adding to like the securities</font>

583
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:56,169
to the the rfcs as a general

584
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:58,270
consideration sorry um pointy end of the

585
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,370
stick refers to the point of sphere

586
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,020
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where all the work gets done this</font>

587
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,560
is the pointy end of the stick for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

588
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,470
get all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the areas are where you want</font>

589
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,080
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned again look at the look</font>

590
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,790
at the areas that you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

591
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,080
groups are in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what you</font>

592
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:20,710
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on um we work the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

593
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,439
area and sort of get into layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 just a</font>

594
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:28,420
tiny little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit mpls for example sorry</font>

595
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,800
layer 2 3 and we almost never get up

596
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,830
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications later there's some</font>

597
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,649
stuff there that's applications enabling

598
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,389
as opposed to a specific application

599
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,610
XMPP would be an example of an

600
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,980
application layer protocol jabbers the

601
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:48,070
actual protocol XMPP is how it gets

602
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:50,080
carried so only need for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

603
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,700
sessions this is our opportunity for

604
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,520
high-bandwidth time um we generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

605
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,190
not pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up new things we sorry though</font>

606
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,370
the working group meeting is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

607
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,210
a combination of resolving new things

608
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,830
possibly hearing about needing

609
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,270
internet-drafts or new documents that

610
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,480
are being added to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter or new</font>

611
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,430
work items that lame you wanted to add

612
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,550
they are being screen recorded if you

613
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,020
want to get up and talk it's ok there's

614
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,120
the microphone

615
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:24,210
get up say your name<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're an</font>

616
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,290
organization speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly be brief um</font>

617
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,820
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have blue sheets in this</font>

618
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,100
meaning for some reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

619
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,050
there's an attendance sheet that's put

620
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,449
in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's your name and your</font>

621
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,730
organization it's there mainly so we can

622
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,920
figure out how large of a room you need

623
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next time for the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

624
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,400
because if you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sometimes</font>

625
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,090
think of working groups going to be 10

626
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,400
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 500 and that's hard to</font>

627
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:53,199
sort of manage so that that provides it

628
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,580
a little thing a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a hint to</font>

629
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,260
sign the blue sheets we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,970
know you're there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the things it</font>

631
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,310
also gives us an indication of people

632
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,530
who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been involved in the process so</font>

633
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,600
it's a process management thing for

634
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Standardization it's it's one of those</font>

635
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,610
small little record-keeping read the

636
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,020
agenda and drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> do listen and if the</font>

637
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaker's not speaking clearly enough</font>

638
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,060
get up and tell them or tell somebody

639
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,209
you tell them if you've read the

640
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,970
document and you have a useful continent

641
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,250
if and only if go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel feel</font>

642
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,320
free to comment be brief don't hog<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

643
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,090
microphone now everybody look around you

644
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,700
on the seats next to you if your bags

645
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:34,090
are there okay that's what I mean here

646
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,650
sometimes you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a room that fills up</font>

647
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,290
and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get everybody</font>

648
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,630
in if you see that people are waiting

649
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,879
for receipt please move your stuff off

650
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,340
before people asking but do it move it

651
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they ask you anyways so and and if</font>

652
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,909
you need to ask somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

653
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,610
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> impolite to do it I know</font>

654
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,380
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's hard with new people</font>

655
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,139
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but please do it side</font>

656
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,210
conversations avoid them it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

657
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">make small comments to the guy you're</font>

658
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,830
sitting with but if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

659
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,060
more in about three seconds the people

around you or start going are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

661
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,360
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going you dirty looks because</font>

662
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,890
you're not being as quiet as you thought

663
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could be so please go on outside um</font>

664
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,240
there is this thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> jabber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

665
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,760
we use it's basically a chat room there

666
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,710
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chat room for every session that</font>

667
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,140
the IETF holds i'll talk about Jabbar a

668
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,550
little bit later if you want to ask a

669
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">question and especially if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

670
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,620
non-english speaker but you understand

671
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,930
written English a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better it's</font>

672
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to use the jab</font>

673
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,610
channel to ask a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to for</font>

674
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,190
clarification and somebody else who's

675
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,929
listening can help you so it's a it's a

676
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:45,920
way for communicating in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting</font>

677
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,920
without actually making noise consensus

678
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:56,220
see you for a second the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF as I said</font>

679
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,590
doesn't vote it decides whether or not

680
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,050
based on what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> rut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus and</font>

681
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,030
rock consensus says that most everybody

682
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,379
thinks this is a good idea the people

683
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,540
who don't think it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

684
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,100
actually addressed the question we may

685
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,270
not agree with it but we've at least

686
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:16,110
discussed it and disposed of it okay so

687
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:18,300
um occasional human<font color="#E5E5E5"> being meeting that</font>

688
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,899
somebody will and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hearing</font>

689
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,909
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah it's not to you back so</font>

690
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,050
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give me an example humming is a</font>

691
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:29,430
way of determining a rough consensus

692
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:31,590
within a group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

693
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:36,630
actually having voting on so for example

694
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:40,169
let's try here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is the</font>

695
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,360
room too hot too cold or just right and

696
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,010
I'll ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question and when I come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

697
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that you agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

698
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,240
will hum so the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of humming and</font>

699
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,040
how loud it is gives us an indication so

700
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,520
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here think the room is</font>

701
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,730
too hot how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here think the</font>

702
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,760
room is too cold how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

703
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room is just right okay so the</font>

704
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,770
consensus of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room by the chair is</font>

705
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,909

738
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,730
the members identically identified as

739
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,210

<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody doesn't ask the question you</font>

00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,330
but it's now our formal session<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>
