108
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,659
think some of this should go fairly

109
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,200
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe one point of discussion</font>

110
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could be interesting I'm expected a</font>

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,470
bit more because we had some stuff that

112

push our discussion to the end which is

116
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,180
some interesting points to move our work

117
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,990
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right anything to bash on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you see so what we're doing is we're</font>

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ingress side you are doing explicit</font>

151
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,380
tracking so you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly which</font>

152
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:30,440
each routers are interested so it can

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:40,939
fit up the beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cap for the</font>

154
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:42,680
appropriate bit sets next so we added to

155
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,410
a trip day the drafty presented last

156
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,120
time and we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> an appendix which is a</font>

157
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,760
use case that comes from this other

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,100
draft but basically talks about beer in

159
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,930
the data center including the excellent

160
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,170
and kept the document apart from that

161
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,359
appendix<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document hasn't changed so</font>

162
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,229
it's been the same stable form for

163
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine except at appendix that the grafted</font>

164
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,880
merged with a proposed some changes to

165
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,769
the mov message format you have taken

166
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that alpha don't want to make any</font>

167
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:20,930
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mov itself you just want to</font>

168
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">use em lbs per signaling and it actually</font>

169
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:28,099
have implemented this and it's been

170
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:33,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">tested by some few different companies</font>

171
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,790
organizations forever so form the data

172
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,709
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that appendix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we might want</font>

173
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think a little bit more about is</font>

174
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,029
there something we can do differently or

175
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:46,490
better but the main part of the

176
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:50,570
documents also this is stable so next

177
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:53,839
slide not blossom occasion so yeah so

178
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:57,290
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will not maybe Oscar this</font>

179
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,000
can be adopted we address first the

180
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,519
history just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit just kind of</font>

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">refresh because you said this added</font>

182
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,430
appendix from the previous trap I think

183
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,529
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which to</font>

184
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,569
roll that work in and abandon that draft

185
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not it yeah okay because we</font>

186
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,660
consolidate remember in curtain<font color="#CCCCCC"> solar</font>

187
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">reaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this consolidated</font>

188
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,980
capsulation we had a various capsulation

189
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,689
giraffes that were kind of stacking up

190
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,970
and we focused all that the unified

191
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,709
solution but there were some ideas than

192
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,260
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular in cap draft that</font>

193
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're overlapping with MLD so we got</font>

194
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,959
those people together<font color="#E5E5E5"> this why the</font>

195
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,399
author list is a bit large but it was

196
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,109
inclusive and bringing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

197
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,110
together and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the direction</font>

198
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,220
that we chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

199
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,380
initially from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interim meeting and</font>

200
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,870
then agreed upon its soul so what you're

201
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,370
asking is this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for adoption</font>

202
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,589
give you some history this should see

203
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel for the room the raise of hands who</font>

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,540
in the working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right good so</font>

that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it mate wait a</font>

about the architecture of OEM young

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,270
um miss upon this and they say that we

266
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,110
should add some very specific technology

267
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:30,290
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so what you have here is</font>

268
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:32,060
a separate draft is this work supposed

269
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,379
to stand as a separate draft from their

270
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,000
perspective or does it get rolled in the

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,870
might be good to ask ask them if they

285
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,970
can have a look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street could you</font>

286
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,709
get the author and charged with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

287
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,980
working girl sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay did you hear it</font>

288
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,150
is yeah actually sweet so so I mean

289
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,010
those of us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room if stepped in</font>

290
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,420
multicast either recently or decades ago

291
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,280
we've been tracking around our careers

292
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,690
right you can't get rid of it but the

293
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,879
reality is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

294
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,200
spend time and multicast often dismiss

295
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,540
it and think it's like something can do

296
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,310
later and bolting it on after the fact

297
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,530
is non-trivial so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

298
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">have multicast experts working on yang</font>

299
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,200
requirements and so we need to roll to

300
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:46,000
beer folks into that Network

301
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:50,529
and you both connect later on and the

317
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:47,760
we list the choice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your item key here</font>

make some mistakes about this the OEM

layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> which it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the young which</font>

322
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:04,059
is asked with the OEM young model on the

323
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:06,309
authors they say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shouldn't be</font>

324
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:10,840
used to hear so which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Omni to this</font>

325
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:13,120
life and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know whether I make it</font>

326
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,779
a clear this is a mistake away make oh

327
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,879
is it yeah after we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick a stronger just</font>

328
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,809
launched like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and they see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font>

329
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like for me this week after should</font>

330
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:33,190
have got this slide hey watch bear with

331
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:34,779
me we got time yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

332
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,269
calls away in the morning we have some

333
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:40,330
discussions with the authors from the

334
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:44,490
young om OM young so they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that</font>

335
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the OEM layer shouldn't videos here</font>

336
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:59,240
the next slide shows and the next slide

337
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:03,050
yeah next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step and this is a newly idea</font>

338
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,540
we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the fear om work so we</font>

339
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:08,480
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask about whether it is ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

340
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,850
start after this work because now we can

341
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,220
see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are many related work for good</font>

342
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,219
jobs such as the lime young

343
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,340
connectionless om the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure young or</font>

344
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,980
group draft and summon it and many

345
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:29,959
others overlay om related to dress yep

346
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:32,870
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg city um I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

347
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:37,730
important to do the correlation with the

348
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:43,250
work in a line<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group I'm not</font>

349
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:45,670
convinced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a connectionless model is</font>

350
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,309
really applicable to beer the main

351
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,650
actually I would probably think that

352
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:56,240
connection oriented would be more for

353
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:59,740
the beer because in a beer miss

354
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,980
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be quite more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

355
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:09,770
critical and that's I think that we

356
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:13,400
should look at which one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so</font>

357
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:16,790
which of the models is more applicable

358
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,130
and suitable for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beer om</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thank</font>

359
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,830
you I got the point and we have a

360
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:26,510
discussion about the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and</font>

361
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:29,510
connect the oranges on the stage and now

362
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,910
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the beer maybe much more</font>

363
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:35,020
related with the connection place and

364
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:38,990
the incorrect has another idea about the

365
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,480
oranges some oranges or with maybe some

366
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:45,920
stage we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss about the details</font>

367
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,800
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one and the list but not</font>

368
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,630
the the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is we welcome you to</font>

369
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,139
fulfill this work together if you are

370
00:22:50,630 --> 00:23:00,070
interested in that next slide maybe

371
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,070
that's all yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks any questions</font>

372
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,820
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just from my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sight that it's for</font>

373
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,070
you for Greg so those are basically just

374
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,520
attachment point and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM model is</font>

375
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,439
generalized I understand it correctly

376
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,050
looking at the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct because the</font>

377
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,690
model is being imported right yeah okay

378
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,520
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do we reconcile the fact</font>

379
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,020
that we have all these specialized bits

380
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,620
on the encapsulation and other

381
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,990
technologies may not have it you think

382
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,300
that you can that's also more like for

383
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,220
Greg you think that you can unify the

384
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,600
models across and all the traditional

385
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,940
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> as in beer and all the other</font>

386
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,090
stuff yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use the</font>

387
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,240
generic young model while adding some

388
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">fearsome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies as big some</font>

389
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">features in the generic young model then</font>

390
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,990
we can from a technologist as big<font color="#E5E5E5"> yahoo</font>

391
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,940
IM<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what we aim to do that okay</font>

392
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,800
so if you import a generic model which

393
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like beer specific stuff that other</font>

394
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:05,500
technologies do not support how do you

395
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:10,030
switched it on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> off yeah that I'm</font>

396
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:14,020
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Greg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your ski so yes there</font>

397
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:19,440
are several ways to do technology

398
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:27,040
specifics so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as argumentum</font>

399
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:35,410
beer specifics to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lime model that's one</font>

400
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:39,399
because basically what at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it's</font>

401
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:42,000
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to speak over so they use</font>

402
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,580
their test point location<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

403
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,030
characterization so if we define if we

404
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:53,050
define test point in a beer since then

405
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:56,020
uh it it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ok but again again ah</font>

406
00:24:53,050 --> 00:25:00,100
it might be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first exercises</font>

407
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:02,860
of applying this abstract model to the

408
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,310
specific technology so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might learn</font>

409
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,169
some lesson so who is the most important

410
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,090
technology now for the bureau a.m. to

411
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,240
synchronize with the traditional martha

412
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,919
casto am going on

413
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,309
uh yes actually i think that uh we

414
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:24,770
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what we call our</font>

415
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:28,410
multicast because for example ah BFD

416
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:32,429
point-to-multipoint would be applicable

417
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:36,150
in my heel to the multicast OEM we do

418
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:40,350
have BF d yang model and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

419
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:45,840
at how BFD as a mechanism is applicable

420
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to beer okay what about the traditional</font>

421
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,090
multicast the gentleman with the beer

422
00:25:52,130 --> 00:26:00,360
but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I don't know much of</font>

423
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:03,179
specific OEM which is a multicast

424
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,510
specific okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put behind the</font>

425
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,270
scenes yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> thnkx</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got before this</font>

426
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:13,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial draft and maybe we should</font>

427
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,160
look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

428
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:27,750
thank you so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent to seek</font>

429
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,270
working group adoption with this maybe

430
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,590
next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fair enough will it flush</font>

431
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,809
it out a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and then we'll take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

432
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">from there good don't need to rush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

433
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:47,899
thank you very much thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

434
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate it all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and next up is</font>

435
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Greg

436
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:11,879
combined yes though it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:17,880
present you an update of work that we

438
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now planning to continue at and do a</font>

439
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:29,610
three group it started as a design team

440
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:34,590
and under part the gvg and let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

441
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:40,429
next slide so what was objective there

442
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:44,250
are effortless to have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> common OEM</font>

443
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:48,480
mechanisms and in structures formats

444
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:51,750
that can be reused by there is overlay

445
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:59,640
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Viera being one of them let's</font>

446
00:27:51,750 --> 00:28:05,310
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> next so one of them is that to create</font>

447
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">an object of associated channel so</font>

448
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,919
associated channel as a paradigm well

449
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:14,340
known and been used for example on

450
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,990
census to the war then generalized

451
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:25,679
associated channel was supported for

452
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:29,460
mpls LSPs it allows to do the

453
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:34,410
multiplexing of<font color="#CCCCCC"> oi'm packets at the same</font>

time are ensuring that these packets

455
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:41,910
would be in band with the data packets

456
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:47,750
if encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their upper layers</font>

457
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,750
is properly constructed it's cool next

458
00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so currently what we overlay header</font>

459
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:07,929
have is it reflects the version number

460
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:13,649
message type length<font color="#CCCCCC"> oam message has some</font>

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:13,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">flags resort filled and next protocol</font>

462
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:23,049
next protocol might be helpful for

463
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:27,089
overlay Network but for different to see

464
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:31,479
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have proposed optional</font>

465
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:34,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">time stamp block that one of the flags</font>

466
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:37,779
indicates presence of the time stamp

00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:41,769
blog which follows immediately overlay

468
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:47,080
OEM header as we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some</font>

469
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:52,179
applications might use it for one way

470
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:55,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">round trip measurements and it supports</font>

471
00:29:52,179 --> 00:30:00,749
use of different time stamp formats

472
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:11,099
whether it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP of PTP version to</font>

473
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:14,979
truncate so in discussing their om we

474
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:19,330
formulated some requirements that go to

475
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:24,909
the overlay encapsulation so that active

476
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:26,918
OEM can<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really comply with the</font>

477
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:29,979
requirements of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to do and</font>

478
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:34,749
one of the requirements is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for mp3</font>

479
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">m to be in band with the data traffic</font>

480
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:45,729
but without support from encapsulation

481
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:49,029
layer that really cannot be fulfilled

482
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:52,749
you can be guaranteed and we have a lot

483
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,320
of examples are<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that in our some</font>

484
00:30:52,749 --> 00:31:01,469
networks that been developed earlier and

485
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:04,149
we had to work on compensating that with

486
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:07,090
example and mpls

487
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:09,310
with introduction of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gal label and the</font>

488
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,610
rule that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> special-purpose</font>

489

490
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">key so what we point to the designers of</font>

491
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:31,290
encapsulations that even though there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

492
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:35,139
a practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using the payload to</font>

493
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:39,149
control and use equal cost multipath

494
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:43,170
environment it's a beneficial to have

495
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:47,260
generate entropy to the level based on

496
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:50,770
certain rules at the edge and then in

497
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:55,450
their domain overlay the main to use

498
00:31:50,770 --> 00:32:00,100
entropy label value for ecmp that will

499
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:03,430
allow use the same value for active OEM

500
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:09,850
packets to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they traverse are</font>

501
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:15,790
the same path of their entropy as data

502
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:20,290
packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next so now this is an</font>

503
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:25,330
example of how we propose to use next

504
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:29,200
protocol filled in Oh am header so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

505
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:33,600
have a pure active OEM case then the

506
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:38,470
next protocol will be lets say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 or</font>

507
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:42,699
actually their context is none so

508
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:46,690
pointing that we have only om message in

509
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:52,750
the packet and that's will be case of

510
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:58,770
epic poem next slide please but we have

511
00:32:52,750 --> 00:33:04,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of discussion of interest um</font>

512
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:07,540
adding on some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM or signaling</font>

513
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,270
statistic telemetry information or to

514
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life packet that can be achieved</font>

515
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:16,179
with the overlay<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM header as well so</font>

516
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:19,450
it's just uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

517
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:27,970
next protocol payload to indicate the

518
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:30,720
payload type of their data packet so we

519
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:35,820
agreed to characterize this method as

520
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:41,350
based on RFC 7799 as a hybrid type<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

521
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:44,259
we still carry data payload but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

522
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:47,199
same time we insert some packet there is

523
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:51,129
already example of this method being

524
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:56,909
used for residence time measurement to

525
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:59,860
support transparent clock in 1588

526
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:03,879
protocol question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with</font>

527
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:08,259
mq problems that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question</font>

528
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:13,989
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactive MTU discovery is</font>

529
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:16,839
important so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario</font>

530
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:23,020
of residence time measurement we only

531
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:27,879
use 64-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> scratchpad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a fixed</font>

532
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:30,309
size and that basically can be accounted

533
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,739
so it's much more easier but yes you

534
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:39,299
right there are some scenarios that are

535
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:42,250
being discussed which limit of MTU and

536
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:50,559
non support the fragmentation is an

537
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:53,829
obstacle<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next so we have second is</font>

538
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:59,500
about echo request reply we can skip

539
00:34:53,829 --> 00:35:03,970
this go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next so the second</font>

540
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:09,040
proposal that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working on is well</font>

541
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">known good old echo request</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reply the</font>

542
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:17,200
format is very much resembles LS beeping

543
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:23,170
it's just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit dense but has all</font>

544
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:26,879
the functionality and our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

545
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:29,420
as much as possible common functionality

546
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,369
reflected in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document and then</font>

547
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,180
all the special cases that might be

548
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:38,619
interested of four different income

549
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:44,240
overlay networks are being done in a

550
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:46,839
respective working groups and that's one

551
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,479
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goals of this presentation to</font>

552
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:53,808
bring it to your attention and raise

553
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,869
some interest for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

554
00:35:53,809 --> 00:36:01,130
common solution at the same time get

555
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:09,680
sitting for how to use this in beer

556
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:13,670
specific scenarios next one and so yes

557
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,210
this work already has somewhat extensive

558
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:21,170
security consideration and how that can

559
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:24,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">be addressed if we introduce this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> echo</font>

560
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:31,819
request reply in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

561
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:37,339
next there is a work on being solution

562
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:41,210
being proposed in the 34 there are trace

563
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:44,359
route and transcending trace route there

564
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:47,390
are some different scenarios that being

565
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:50,690
considered because we have overlay and

566
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:53,390
we have underlay transcending tourist

567
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,150
route addresses the tracing of underlay

568
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:02,029
network but there are scenarios I

569
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:06,109
believe in beer we're tracing overlay is

570
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:09,230
as important because you have ingress

571
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:12,380
router you have transit via farce and

572
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:17,380
then you have egress routers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

573
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:20,559
they might have ecmp in overlay as well

574
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:27,920
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that will be</font>

your reviews and comments suggestions to

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,850
that group but at the same time please

579
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:47,759
consider this as a framework that will

580
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,759
if you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

gentlemen a lot has a question mr.

584
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,130
about this particular work and how it

actually is not taking place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

group but he has a responsibility to

587
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,130
notify all the groups that it could

588
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,630
affect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue is you put up a</font>

15-minute presentation in 15 different

590

591
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,460
consolidate the problem is there's

592
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,350
nothing structured in the IETF to let

593

here and we can get solid representation

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,430
from the beer group towards the OEM so

602
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,170
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is more specific you have</font>

626
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,860
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the code points have been</font>

627
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:14,060
cold now so Jeffrey<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot the stuff off</font>

628
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:18,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dough will be going base to iono</font>

629
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:22,770
ospf is under 7120 arm so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

630
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:25,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> INR earlier location thingy arm and</font>

631
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:28,380
we need three values we need to be R sub

632
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,670
tlv mpls encapsulation sub theory which

633
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:35,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really a sub sub field in the</font>

treetops subsea<font color="#CCCCCC"> FeLV next one and is is</font>

635
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,669
is actually under expert review less

636
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:47,970
left the room right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's not in the</font>

637
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:51,180
building so so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be poking the</font>

638
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,879
chairs there I I think they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

639
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:57,870
experts and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably we advise iono</font>

640
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,590
as well armed technically we also need

641
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:05,069
three points for the mpls and caps are

642
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,960
we need for the Bering for and their sub

643
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,240
sub povs which is the mpls and kept

644
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,740
supplementary car but we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be BSL</font>

645
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,410
conversion which is optional right now

646
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,930
on ice ice which is missing no SPF maybe

647
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,990
we introduce that so that's kind of

648
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,190
getting official get gnarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocation</font>

649
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,470
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can actually now star</font>

650
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">interruptus stuff with official no early</font>

651
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:34,770
allocated numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it questions nope</font>

652
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:40,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay sheron's with who are you excited</font>

653
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:43,820
named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric Rosen juniper is also need</font>

654
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,480
for code points were hungry tunnel types

655
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:52,770
be at all so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overlay drops</font>

656
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,630
right well I'm lost we're talking over

657
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:57,060
light drafts as well that we need code

658
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,970
points there I

659
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,180
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sent a note to the men three</font>

660
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">rework worker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups as before early</font>

661
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,069
allocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> code point I think was the</font>

662
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:09,990
principal type at all for being<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

663
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:12,840
I didn't see on your list right so okay

664
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,669
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more no asking for early</font>

665
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,170
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> who okay so should I introduce</font>

666
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:33,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so you can work together on that</font>

667
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:36,360
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who are you anonymous ad sorry</font>

668
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:39,120
allianz um how solid are the ino

669
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,760
sections in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents and that's</font>

670
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,470
really the main question in which sense

671
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,890
what will these requests for my Anna

672
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:49,020
both documents at Diana sections but

673
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,660
what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requested you or what you</font>

674
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,880
question how solid are the IANA request

675
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,529
sections on the various drafts whatever

676
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:04,890
solid mean they're not squishy if I a

677
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:07,350
solid I could I can take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them</font>

678
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,390
if the working groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy you know</font>

679
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:13,410
we're happy the main issue with early

680
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,750
allocation is it's about a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

681
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,629
you can do a second request but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

682
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:25,070
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it starts say deadline for</font>

683
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:29,010
when the allocations are expire huh yeah

684
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:30,990
I think they do meet the requirements of

685
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,880
our t71 plenty in that department

686
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:36,120
expected stable we really need these

687
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,100
bullet points to do a prototype and I

688
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,710
would worry so much myself about the

689
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:45,060
deadline people at leighs<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing it was</font>

690
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:47,550
a good way no but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to due</font>

691
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,040
process then I get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one is</font>

692
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:52,800
fine and then the second one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is go and</font>

693
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:59,009
explain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ASG why we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend</font>

694
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,360
it an additional time point is that

695
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,430
someone else's problems that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

696
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,320
saying right and you don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

697
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:09,660
know to comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I think about this</font>

698
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,789
one year anyway right so right in

699
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,589
comments on that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a</font>

700
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:16,650
status update than a request in the room

701
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:23,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it is a and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

702
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:25,410
group as a whole silly comment right we

703
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,000
didn't when we made these<font color="#E5E5E5"> with recipes</font>

704
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">for quiet i recall the proper process</font>

705
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,859
and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for any suggested values</font>

706
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,230
however if it just happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be anybody</font>

707
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">who actually feel to the prototype and</font>

708
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,500
actually uses values that don't come

709
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,309
from the experimental space this might

710
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,990
be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for them to speak up and</font>

711
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:46,049
the hope that I Anna will allocate three

712
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,750
different values maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> st.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vitus yes I</font>

713
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:50,520
also have right so I yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

714
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,289
I also have a discussion behind the

715
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,319
scene that some of the SR code points

716
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,910
are being squatted on and we may collide

717
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,770
right so that's all going behind the

718
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,328
scene and I think all the stuff will be

719
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:10,470
put forward by the people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who</font>

720
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:14,730
you are next slide that's your last

721
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:16,109
slide is when the hook comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

722
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can overstate that</font>

723
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,500
enough when we please<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with Eric</font>

724
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,640
reach out to him if you've got any

725
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,829
implementation working with now to

726
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,750
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we say consists in the</font>

727
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">development work on any code points</font>

728
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,349
you're currently using and address that

729
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:34,529
going forward with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a request</font>

730
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:36,059
through Eric yes you sir I san Cisco so

731
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:37,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah thinks the raisin goes or the</font>

732
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:39,329
allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XD so it's about time</font>

733
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,279
exit to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that so we can</font>

734
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:44,940
be there is some interpretive testing

735
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:47,490
you know many times yeah thanks did you

736
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,349
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> interrupt testing you got robbed too</font>

737
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,919
thin yeah goodness that's a segue to the

738
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:56,369
next piece here thank you that was your

739
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:03,059
cue all right all right good we're done

740
00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> your don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bother comments good and</font>

741
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:12,660
this is me all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to this all</font>

742
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,099
right now open<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion section you</font>

743
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,990
guys are fully aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a</font>

744
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:18,109
charter it's a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group in our</font>

745
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:21,118
charter we're told that this work is

746
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:23,190
experimental an<font color="#E5E5E5"> experimental status is</font>

747
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,470
actually dependent upon

748
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,910
our ability to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

749
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:30,390
something that the community needs as a

750
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:33,240
whole it's a shift in the in addition to

751
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:34,529
the internet architecture so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I posted</font>

752
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,910
this just the text right from the

753
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,829
Charter you guys can pull the stuff up

754
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,910
and if I could read it to you or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

755
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,560
read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself but I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight</font>

756
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,940
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> key points in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this that are part of</font>

757
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,400
our decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving this stuff forward</font>

758
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,109
so particular sensitivity of adding new

759
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,369
significant functionality to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

760
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:49,078
to product to the data plan that's

761
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,940
really what's unique about what we were

762
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,770
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the current</font>

763
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:57,060
internet architecture we've got ipv4

764
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 and pls and now we've got beer so</font>

765
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,920
it's at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in the hourglass that</font>

766
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,369
we're asking to not change something but

767
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,930
add something new and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can seed your</font>

768
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,160
thoughts but I'd rather get thoughts

769
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,140
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room first and have a really</font>

770
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,640
open discussion about this stuff in the

771
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,430
Charter it says look at item nine below

772
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,740
so nine brought in here deployment

773
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,480
evaluation seems to be the key to seeing

774
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,578
so we can look at this and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

775
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,990
makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of sense what does it really</font>

776
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,339
happen on the wire what has happened in

777
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,439
hardware which the impact the

778
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:28,319
architecture of the boxes as well as the

779
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,730
Internet at large so in this it talks

780
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,440
about deployment experience without

781
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,869
defining what deployment experience is

782
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,089
and I've had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion with folks</font>

783
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:37,740
along the way and I think it's it's a

784
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,910
fair assessment well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it back yeah</font>

785
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,560
I'll put it out there I think it's a

786
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,299
fair assessment to say that before

787
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,828
anyone actually puts in the network they

788
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,569
beat the crap out of it in their labs

789
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:48,089
they're supposed to do that operators do

790
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:50,460
that today and for them that's an

791
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:52,770
adequate test point before it actually

792
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,720
goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a live network I think it's</font>

793
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,579
fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us that to say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

794
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask them to do anything more</font>

795
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:00,960
than than what they currently did if it

796
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,790
works in the lab that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to be</font>

797
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,349
an deployment experience that the work

798
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,880
group should listen to and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

799
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,650
forward in this document this

800
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,150
description that's in here has to be in

801
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,740
a document we need to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so</font>

802
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:13,200
what I'm going to do today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open</font>

803
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,509
discussion and then get some volunteers

804
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,450
to provide some input into putting this

805
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,160
document together so what I'm puttin out

806
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:23,040
there's deployment experience I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

807
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,839
should qualify as real implementations

808
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,619
in someone's operator lab somewhere

809
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:29,970
where they're getting real traffic like

810
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:32,880
conditions in a network that they

811
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:34,649
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to evaluate any code or our</font>

812
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,890
product or feature this can be rolled

813
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,840
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the production network so</font>

814
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:45,740
would have thoughts with that rejection

815
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:51,080
to that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different opinion acceptance</font>

816
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:52,609
of that idea anyone okay yeah go to the

817
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,670
mic sir Oh acceptance there we go so

818
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:58,520
here it is who thinks that that an

819
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,170
operator's lab evaluation of an

820
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:04,880
implementation should be consider

821
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:09,350
successful deployment experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

822
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,060
anyone think that's inadequate one

823
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:14,930
person can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you articulate maybe why you</font>

824
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,220
think it's inadequate not to put you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

825
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the spot but I want to put you on the</font>

826
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,399
spot

827
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,060
adequate to consider I'm sorry we're

828
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting here no no not your name there</font>

829
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,740
it's adequate to consider it deployment

830
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:41,500
experience I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's adequate</font>

831
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:43,720
for us to remove experimental so that

832
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,310
that's that's a distinction I want to

833
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,470
make can you can you explain why why

834
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:50,259
would that be different<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because people</font>

835
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:52,750
playing the labs with million things and

836
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,000
I can give you a big list of things that

837
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:59,740
people play with in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the labs that never</font>

838
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,420
saw the life of the day so a so there

839
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,890
was a reason why we put the experimental

840
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:08,440
I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good momentum</font>

841
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:10,540
with their technology but a a deployment

842
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,900
experience and talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the labs</font>

843
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:17,020
again will help us to get to remove the

844
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:19,720
experimental but as such is a step

845
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,060
forward but not sufficient I think we

846
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:26,169
want to see people actually follow up

847
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:29,560
with two deployments in well drilling my

848
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:31,359
true deployment in a production<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can</font>

849
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">i address that issue because what we're</font>

850
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:37,119
talking about a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit vague i would</font>

851
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:39,190
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some lab work that</font>

852
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> considered almost toy like and</font>

853
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,600
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other lab implementations that</font>

854
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,220
are actually full replications of the

855
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">production network with actual traffic</font>

856
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,759
patterns those things exist so how would

857
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,230
that be different than I mean if I'm an

858
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,900
operator I'm not putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into my</font>

860
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,730
where I will now we're asking the eye

861
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:03,160
teeth to do more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that oh it's fine</font>

862
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:07,060
with me again the experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:14,470

00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a bad for so I'm a little bit</font>

sure not for beer but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font>

872
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,869
because forbid I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for</font>

873
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,030
what comes after once you create a

00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,980
precedence

875
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,750
can I can use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own words in my</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put revenue generating traffic you</font>

878
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,220
didn't say unless you are putting

revenue Jerry traffic so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested</font>

880
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,000
through my lab and I know this is what

881
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,560
it's done I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to do it with</font>

882
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,580
revolutionary traffic I've met that

883
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,960
requirement already that's not listen

884
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,970
look I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that's why</font>

885
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,680
you have a lab right I do that to do

886
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,629
this evaluation before i'm going to go

887
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,740
ahead and make that jump and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

888
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,620
an operator that's going to step forward

00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,020
and said I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to make that jump</font>

890
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:14,609
they've already done that evaluation now

891
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,660
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to we can't just take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

892
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,730
blindly we need to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

893
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,230
they've done the extensive amount of

894
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:21,270
testing they've done and take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

895
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,130
into consideration you're like said some

896
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:26,100
lab work is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a toy and some lab work</font>

897
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:28,170
is actually real copies of revenue

898
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,630
generating traffic let's look when we

899
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:34,080
have a good operators with good names

900
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,940
come and say that then we'll cross this

901
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,580
bridge she'll like right that's a

902
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,230
hypothetical hi Paula it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer</font>

903
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,799
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to have a lawyer discussion</font>

904
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:46,790
or discussion oh come on when you don't

905
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,050
give up now so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'd are you</font>

906
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,570
technical points now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to</font>

907
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:54,860
lawyer points so like you know I sorry

908
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:58,590
I'll degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> it technical I'm very clear</font>

909
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:00,870
and I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good support of</font>

910
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:02,670
industry this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good stuff to</font>

911
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,430
deploy we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it out of</font>

912
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:08,610
experimental getting to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks to</font>

913
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:12,049
be allowed to do that not not let's not

914
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:14,310
create the precedence with something I

915
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,200
believe we already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this will</font>

916
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:19,230
not be experimental otherwise you

917
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,060
wouldn't be doing this so if we believe

918
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,950
in it and I looking sure why we're

919
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,790
having a discussion but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking for</font>

920
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:28,080
a precedence and I haven't found one

921
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,940
right we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the 14 plane</font>

922
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:35,340
here what was the president's to adopt

923
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:36,810
ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i'm honest i mean that's</font>

924
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,040
that's where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the hourglass i'm</font>

925
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,920
not i'm not trying to just be facetious

926
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,900
I mean this is real now right so I I

927
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,130
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to set precedence</font>

928
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,960
with it I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to reference something</font>

929
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,880
that we have and what we have is texture

930
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,020
that's not defined so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

931
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,030
what the community understands and your

932
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,170
input is very important but what we do

933
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,109
from this group let me

934
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:57,270
momentum to me so I that so to me

935
00:53:55,109 --> 00:54:01,230
deployment experience is and it's not a

936
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:03,750
lab as simple as it to me deployment

937
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:07,020
experience is not allowed i can give you

938
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,790
many examples when a lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

939
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody was spending a lot and this</font>

940
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,359
stuff won't know where so i wouldn't say

941
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,770
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year but there's a</font>

942
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:16,529
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chicken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and egg that goes with</font>

943
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:20,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well right and and you know if</font>

944
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:23,390
we put we put it in movable object and

945
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:25,670
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little tough however</font>

946
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,990
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the options and maybe take a</font>

947
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,849
sense of the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we could probably</font>

948
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:32,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">move this all the way to RFC under</font>

949
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:34,290
experimental much quicker but does that

950
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:36,299
really serve our purpose is it worth

951
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,460
going through the work and and and

952
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:40,230
making this effort to ensure we get on

953
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,089
the standards track take a little extra

954
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,890
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is important</font>

955
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:45,599
for the overall net architecture rather

956
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,940
than push it through so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

957
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,760
sense of the room first that's okay so

958
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:53,160
okay who thinks it's worth the effort to

959
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:58,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to get this work shifted to the</font>

960
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:59,700
standards track who would rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> see us</font>

961
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:07,049
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> push this through and keep it</font>

962
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimental Wow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so four to 12 15</font>

963
00:55:07,049 --> 00:55:10,770
ish so Sanders track is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning</font>

964
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,720
on the volume there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take it the</font>

965
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,210
list to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some feedback so in our</font>

966
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,500
charter we have it didn't say no option

967
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,450
it gave us the option move this up

968
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,890
forward so I'd say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is work that has</font>

969
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,029
already been accepted to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopted by</font>

the working group we can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

971
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,540
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the group to</font>

972
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,270
decide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 80 S&I</font>

973
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:31,200
and make the decision of where we move

974
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:45,329
my SG<font color="#CCCCCC"> no makes a decision on the move</font>

975
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:47,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">from track to track only atlas so to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">make the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision to have it be not</font>

977
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,210
experimental would require reach our

978
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,009
during the working group because the

979
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:57,569
working group is chartered for

980
00:55:53,010 --> 00:56:00,059
experimental work and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my</font>

tape myself taking the working group

charter to the iesg for approval and

983

with the current charter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would mean</font>

984
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:14,779
that for instance this number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 having a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to issue a new RFC member with the</font>

1003
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:09,828
you know experience because there's one

1004
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,720
dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did have an document status</font>

1005
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:13,670
update and we're learning from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1006
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,069
we do have that process available to us

1007
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:17,599
in the IHF so I'd say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1008
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:19,670
process it's not completely flushed out

1009
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:22,130
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process here as well working</font>

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:29,480
enough interest at least work on this

00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:32,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">document to make our case that sound</font>

1014
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,710
reasonable I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who would</font>

1015
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:35,029
like to push it forward faster I mean

1016
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,499
this doesn't stop that I mean we're

1017
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">still going to progress but at least if</font>

1018
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:40,848
nothing more that being skeptical is

1019
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,589
good here's a chance to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together an</font>

1020
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:44,930
argument that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can then evaluate and</font>

1021
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:48,529
decide whether to accept or not all

1022
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:50,720
right there is also now for other

1023
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:53,559
purposes but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font>

1024
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,720
here the waiting for implementation

1025
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:58,369

1027
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:03,380
determine consensus and get them into

1028
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:05,869
really solid shape and then if it sits

1029
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,819
waiting for implementation which in this

1030
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:10,819
case might be implementation and

1031
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:13,819
deployment that would at least be a way

1032
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:15,619
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicating the documents are fairly</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Directorate reviews done ahead of</font>

time

1036
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:30,310
I'd certainly welcome seeing progress on

1037
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:34,420
this item I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not</font>

1038
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:37,310
anticipate an argument about lab

1039
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:41,410
experience qualifying his deployment

1040
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:41,410
experience when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Charter</font>

1041
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:47,330
there's in my defense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my point</font>

1042
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:49,340
I've so can others that thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1043
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I said well we hasn't been to</font>

1044
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,690
find let's find out what the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks</font>

1045
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:01,580
the deployment doesn't say

1046
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:03,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">revenue-generating either I ice so I</font>

1047
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:06,470
guess you have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more free</font>

1048
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,570
bed made from the operators right if

1049
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,770
they have any issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something</font>

1050
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:12,560
being experimental putting in your

1051
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,210
network or SUV is kind of strike that's

1052
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,130
it from an architecture when you do with

1053
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,810
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our jump well then it doesn't</font>

1054
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:20,900
be change anything like is more

1055
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">processed at this we go but operators</font>

1056
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:26,780
speak up<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a point</font>

1057
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,940
to I mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your concern and we sure</font>

1058
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,040
lab is not live and when to find either

1059
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,990
way but it really comes down whatever

1060
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that case it's the operator inputs more</font>

1061
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:39,830
important than implementers here yeah i

1062
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,960
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of danger now Lenny</font>

1063
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,270
Giuliano juniper I would echo what

1064
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,880
Andrew was saying I mean lab is a lab

1065
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it and also it creates a really low</font>

1066
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,660
bar that you can kind of game<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

1067
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,210
yeah I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a lab okay cool</font>

1068
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,950
deployment experience um you know

1069
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:56,180
there's there's a difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab</font>

1070
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,129
and deployment experience there's some

1071
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:00,470
extensive labs don't get me wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1072
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:04,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> still doesn't substitute for what a</font>

1073
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:06,649
real deployment is and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1074
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,160
if I were an operator I'd be more

1075
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:12,530
comfortable adopting something that is

1076
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,330
in experimental then somebody who tried

1077
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:19,280
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> game the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by gading getting it</font>

1078
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:23,859
in this standards track by claiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1079
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,859
a lab deployment is a real deployment

1080
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,800
yeah i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think aggravated a</font>

1081
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,020
good point

1082
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,030
but to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the really issue is is though</font>

1083
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,710
why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to extra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work to make it</font>

1084
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard rather than experimental I mean</font>

1085
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:40,320
what difference does it make it's just a

1086
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:41,910
matter of politics of the base documents

1087
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,850
have been sitting around for three years

1088
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,200
with maybe in one case it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> K into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1089
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,049
interim mostly they haven't changed

1090
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,939
March the editors are likely to die of

1091
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:54,720
old age before the things that come on

<font color="#E5E5E5">ROC if we don't do much more work Oregon</font>

1093
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,580
it were going to be nice to get them all

1094
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:07,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q and an archival format this weekend</font>

1095
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:09,900
no Martin Hana far from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea um has</font>

1096
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:14,339
been the question for operator feedback

1097
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's fine here well long story short I</font>

1098
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:22,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this question doesn't really</font>

1099
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:24,810
matter too much so what matters for us

1100
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:28,290
most is running code next is we have the

1101
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:30,990
document we can refer to so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

1102
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:34,980
an RFC rather than a verbal document

1103
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:36,479
would definitely be a plus the document

1104
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,960
of course always being better than

1105
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,800
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you are also right</font>

1106
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,730
Greg their own apt and their labs

1107
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:49,710
whatever is in our level my left

1108
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:51,450
specific is usually quite close to being

1109
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:54,300
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed in a very big network</font>

1110
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:56,640
and anything that is going to be

1111
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:59,520
deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our network is going through</font>

1112
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,490
this lab so that is something different

1113
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">than left in many cases that's true in</font>

1114
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,259
general I would say yes this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1115
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:10,680
that belongs on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn attract but if</font>

1116
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:16,530
there's serious difficulties or delay I

1117
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:19,919
don't really care thank you Greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> mercy</font>

1118
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:21,870
city um let me extend this argument of

1119
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,290
lab a little bit further to

1120
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:28,529
interoperability because how we evaluate

1121
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:30,810
whether solutions are interoperable or

1122
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:34,350
not I believe that we do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab</font>

1123
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:37,740
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our lab being testing two</font>

1124
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:39,420
different implementations are improving

1125
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,100
in the opportunity would it be

1126
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,330
sufficient to demonstrate

1127
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,740
interoperability

1128
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:50,150
not so in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding that's</font>

1129
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:52,350
sufficient then the lab itself is

1130
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:59,730
reasonable but I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

1131
01:02:52,350 --> 01:03:01,950
speaker that their labs and labs low

1132
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:04,800
engineer verizon so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to</font>

1133
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,629
understand yeah so what's the ass from

1134
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:12,390
the operator to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from experimental</font>

1135
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:14,730
standard what's the ask so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may know</font>

1136
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:17,819
how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already let me let me</font>

1137
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:19,740
chime in here so I like hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down</font>

1138
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we had a lot of hands</font>

1139
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,879
going up 15 people when it is

1140
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,400
informational RFC to be worked on

1141
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,590
pointing up you know the application of

1142
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,960
the technology experience and so on so

1143
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,610
these 15 people if they care about

1144
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,650
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff on the standards track</font>

1145
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:36,960
rather than just popping a hand up

1146
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:39,120
should basically start to crank this RFC

1147
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,350
and I understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I heard about</font>

1148
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:45,420
revenue generating department or maybe

1149
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,799
people felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1150
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,420
operate is here and doesn't matter to

1151
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,250
you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy something another</font>

1152
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,950
quick use experimental versus standard

1153
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">trick is it does have to be standards</font>

1154
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,450
before you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> fetch it to a</font>

1155
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,189
preliminary<font color="#CCCCCC"> 95% the plan nine ten</font>

1156
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:05,730
percenter has to be signed in fact it

1157
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:07,650
won't be firm<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no yeah you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

1158
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,810
yeah yeah so there's other options right

1159
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:14,490
now right I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy this</font>

1160
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:16,529
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got otherwise but if I a</font>

1161
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,790
standard and the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is clear and it</font>

1162
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:20,400
brings benefit to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business than</font>

1163
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:23,250
output but if I'm deploying it just for

1164
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun of it and it's my energy but I</font>

1165
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,670
have other options today so there's

1166
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,960
thing go so came at the time you're

1167
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:32,040
right but you know what are the other

1168
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,260
options work so I mean I Mohammed or

1169
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,850
operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm asking the question what do</font>

1170
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,510
you want from an operator to deploy an

01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,910

01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,690
operate a big service provider may be

1176
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:52,879
out of smaller ones maybe they will say

1177
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:52,880
yes a big server<font color="#CCCCCC"> sawada it's a list</font>

1178
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:59,279
thank you yep

1179
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,828
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roberta gundark so from the</font>

1180
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:03,990
perspective of deployment in enterprise

1181
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,029
network what really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when we</font>

1182
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:07,950
deploy experimental and then it switches

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards track our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on a</font>

are from different pool right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no change in implementation I</font>

1188
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:19,380
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it matters which way what</font>

1189
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,470
matters is actually in tableau

1190
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:27,440
implementing so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec</font>

1191
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:27,439
stays intact specification wise I don't

1192
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:33,538
ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can credit this I thought that</font>

1193
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:37,379
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough just to click the</font>

experimental to<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard after and</font>

1195
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:43,710
everything stays the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there is a</font>

01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:47,819
reason for deployment guys we do have it

1197
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:59,430
bad every now and then after passing

1198
01:05:47,819 --> 01:06:02,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">labs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no so oh yeah listen um the</font>

1199
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:05,160
ionic code points wouldn't change as I

1200
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:10,589
was saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the documents were issued</font>

1201
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:13,799
as experimental rfcs and then we had a

1202
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:16,828
draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> explained the benefits and so</font>

1203
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:19,440
on enter experience with it and wanted

1204
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:22,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to standards track that could be</font>

1205
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">as simple as a status update to the</font>

1206
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:29,480
document to change it from experimental

1207
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:34,650
to standards to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed standard the</font>

1208
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:37,520
the reason why the working group was

1209
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:40,170
chartered as exploit experimental and

1210
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:44,670
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine was put in here as a way to</font>

1211
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:48,480
go forward is because as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg said this</font>

1212
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:52,890
is at a narrow very narrow point in the

1213
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:56,430
hourglass and if it provides concrete

1214
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:59,359
benefits to networks such that there's a

1215
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:01,680
strong motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy it great</font>

1216
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:07,710
obviously I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology myself</font>

1217
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,660
but if it's simply a lovely technical

1218
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:12,079
idea

1219
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:16,578
that doesn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business drive</font>

1220
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,799
behind it I don't want I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF standards</font>

1221
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:20,990
to have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account for the</font>

1222
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:24,079
next 20 years for an idea that didn't

1223
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:27,140
happen right and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what the</font>

1224
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:30,589
heart of nine is getting to is when we

1225
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:33,259
had the ball there were obviously the

1226
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice technology a lot of progress has</font>

1227
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:40,069
been made on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document since then as</font>

1228
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:42,619
well but we couldn't quantify some of

1229
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:45,440
the benefits that would drive towards

1230
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:48,589
deployment and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1231
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter text which is somewhat hard to</font>

1232
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:56,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">read from here then you'll see that the</font>

1233
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:58,250
question is sort of what are the

1234
01:07:56,089 --> 01:08:00,200
benefits what's our experience in the

1235
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:05,270
trade-offs can you quantify it in a way

1236
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:16,549
that justifies it and bluntly does it

1237
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:17,630
actually solve your problems right so

1238
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this has actually been pretty</font>

1239
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:22,339
enlightening to thank you mmm that it

1240
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,250
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really there's no</font>

1241
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:27,649
hard requirement to change the Charter

1242
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:29,630
direction before these documents get

1243
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">published we can take the stuff forward</font>

1244
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,410
and in the experimental track and in

1245
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,850
parallel those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've you raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1246
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,318
hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll reach on the email list we</font>

1247
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">can start working on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document which</font>

1248
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,339
will be needed in either case to move

1249
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:42,710
this work into consideration forward to

1250
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:44,929
make that vision into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> center track I</font>

1251
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:46,489
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that keeps everybody busy and I</font>

1252
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:48,109
think we keep everyone happy move things

1253
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:49,790
forward we got something documented we

1254
01:08:48,109 --> 01:08:51,350
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem deployed and then</font>

1255
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:56,089
we can then follow up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the doc move</font>

1256
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:57,380
it forward so this was the fall out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1257
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:59,019
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we can we can beat this up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1258
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,790
room a bit more what's our time was here

1259
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great and you guys</font>

1260
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:05,600
are dying to spend more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time talking</font>

1261
01:09:03,259 --> 01:09:07,370
about beer right look at that nods and

1262
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:11,810
grins I see smiling face the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1263
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:12,890
that all so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with this</font>

1264
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,960
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular the analysis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the impact</font>

1265
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:16,069
and benefits of new beard airplane to

1266
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,660
the overall in an architecture would

1267
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:21,750
specifically talking about that choke

1268
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:23,700
point like what is this benefit and

1269
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,990
I've been stewed I mean it's obvious

1270
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,970
from those that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been banging on</font>

1271
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:30,778
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> along it up and see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta</font>

1272
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:34,080
right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what hit me is that I would</font>

1273
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:37,200
say IP multicast was a mistake I'm going

1274
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:39,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to throw it out there using the IP</font>

1275
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:42,809
header<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent multiple endpoints</font>

1276
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:46,109
requiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> n2n flow state across the</font>

1277
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is a pretty broken idea right</font>

1278
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:52,380
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a requirement unicast at all</font>

1279
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:55,650
and so we basically bent the rules in 89

1280
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,880
to do something unique and the reason

1281
01:09:55,650 --> 01:10:00,210
why it was done is because the

1282
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,820
replication the utility replication is

1283
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:05,100
well understood and we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

1284
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:07,620
tool set moving forward to get there and

1285
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:11,310
that tool set began in a stateless

1286
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:13,309
manner on IP and is basically evolved

1287
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,260
with those assumptions for decades

1288
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:18,600
finally we came to a point where

1289
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:21,000
maturity<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is is grown to where</font>

1290
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:23,010
we have our networks as well as our

1291
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,750
internet responsibilities and within our

1292
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,880
networks me make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1293
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-to-end within our network and not</font>

1294
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,430
and an host a host and beer was a chance

1295
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to came out of the chance of looking at</font>

1296
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:36,120
that and say what do I want with them I

1297
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:38,190
topology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me the utility</font>

1298
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,010
replication without this flow based

1299
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:42,929
requirement so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in this</font>

1300
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:44,430
discussion that's that's at least if I

1301
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:47,130
were to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> this now that's kind of</font>

1302
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:50,700
direction I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would take that we're fixing</font>

1303
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a thirty-year-old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake right we're</font>

1304
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,870
providing a set of tools now that makes

1305
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:57,480
unicast replicate with the same

1306
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:59,220
simplicity the same will let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

1307
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,950
use this phrase i call it deterministic

1308
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:03,810
convergence something is totally unique

1309
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:05,160
to those of us in bangin on both the

1310
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:07,260
cast long enough right you do something

1311
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your lab and it looks great and you</font>

1312
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,470
roll it out in deployment and as more

1313
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:12,960
and more people use that service the

1314
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:14,400
performance degrades because the flow

1315
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,890
state begins to explode inside the

1316
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> condition in</font>

1317
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,860
Bureau it's a radical shift in how

1318
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are done inside that network so</font>

1319
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:25,799
it's it's actually in the same way

1320
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,059
people I won't mention technologies but

1321
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> look of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology say what's your</font>

1322
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,930
multicast solution for that under the

1323
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,730
assumption that<font color="#CCCCCC"> replications something</font>

1324
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:35,130
you could bolt onto any technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1325
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:36,928
the fact and get that sort of utility

1326
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:39,840
those around long enough know that it's

1327
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">not trivial and it should be part of the</font>

1328
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,679
architecture from the beginning and so

1329
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:47,130
what this is doing is really giving a

1330
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,840
toolset that allows replication in a

1331
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:51,120
very inexpensive and lightweight way

1332
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,380
that has been unique in terms of what

1333
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,909
we've done in there and architecture in

1334
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past so on my totally off base</font>

1335
01:11:55,909 --> 01:12:06,989
resonate with anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're back typing</font>

1336
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:13,049
I lost them yeah I tried all right yeah

1337
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:16,230
you so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the show of hands</font>

1338
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:19,560
those well yeah I won't limit the input

1339
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:24,599
who is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to assist putting this</font>

1340
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:26,190
document together Wow even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one of the</font>

1341
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,380
naysayers thank you that your input it

1342
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:29,849
be important I appreciate it I'm a

1343
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,020
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappointed as many hands came</font>

1344
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,190
up so yeah let's move it forward but

1345
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least three now I'll take</font>

1346
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:36,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to list as well and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can start you</font>

1347
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:38,099
know an ad hoc discussion and start

1348
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,710
flushing this thing out in the meantime

1349
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,949
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a group some of this work is</font>

1350
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">already quite mature and I think it's</font>

1351
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:47,219
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start considering which</font>

1352
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:50,100
documents can start going to last call

1353
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:58,110
and start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting some into the editors</font>

1354
01:12:50,100 --> 01:13:01,980
q your cue short she's dying for more

1355
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:06,599
work look at that all right look she's

1356
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:10,230
so bored she's knitting all right any

1357
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,909
objections of that idea everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1358
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:14,968
board with that I think we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good</font>

1359
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:19,290
direction now on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all right</font>

1360
01:13:14,969 --> 01:13:22,260
any last comments even know where the

1361
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:26,760
great beer is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> town and try that one</font>

1362
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:28,800
all right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found some oh good have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1363
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,030
found some already at lunch maybe a

1364
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,830
small loss comment about the

1365
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,050
architecture and the mpls or the

1366
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:35,400
encapsulation dog so we didn't present

1367
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:37,409
here this time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were very</font>

1368
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,599
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes to that so all the</font>

1369
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:41,638
changes made to the cancellation

1370
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,860
documents we you know presented on four

1371
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:45,659
hands so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't present it</font>

1372
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,039
this time yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all pretty</font>

1373
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:51,959
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

1374
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:54,688
a testament to his maturity yeah and

1375
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">just just one final comment one of your</font>

1376
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:57,719
concerns is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken and egg you need</font>

01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:04,649
to this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and so um what I would</font>

1379
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:05,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would kind of suggests that if this is</font>

1380

useful people are going to play whether

1381
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:11,398
regardless of its label if its standards

1385
01:14:17,849 --> 01:14:21,989
it to a different category because

1386
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:23,579
that'll make it get used if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not if</font>

01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:25,138
it's useful it'll get used regardless of

01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:26,969
what it's called and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the</font>

1389
01:14:25,139 --> 01:14:28,709
feedback we got from operators was that

1390
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:32,760
RFC static was more important than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>
