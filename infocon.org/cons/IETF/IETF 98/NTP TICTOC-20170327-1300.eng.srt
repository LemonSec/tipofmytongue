<font color="#E5E5E5">networking one of the things we did this</font>

62
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,950
time was we didn't list terminus

63
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,690
networking as a conflict and it really

64
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,789
should be and so will will fix that

65
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,229
going forward I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they've got</font>

66
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,529
scheduled on top of each other and so

67
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:52,199
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crossover</font>

68
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:56,429
so the Yankees will be coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there</font>

72
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,669
working group status and then the yang

73
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:12,808
data models and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a short</font>

74
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:19,169
discussion on joint ntp<font color="#CCCCCC"> tik tok next</font>

76
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,229

77
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:23,878
of emails today where we did not issue

78
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,609
calls for adoption that we were supposed

79
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,899
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issued after the last meeting</font>

and they all got issued today or one of

81
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that issued yesterday I think but</font>

82
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:37,379
anyway in any event so i was talking to

83
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:40,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">brian today he's not here for this</font>

86
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,789
the jabber room what has happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

87
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:54,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp and we're about to cover that ok so</font>

88
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:58,529
the call for adoption on the mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 has</font>

89
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:01,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">been issued there were two questions</font>

90
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,849
from Brian so first of all a

91
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,979
clarification on the call for adoption

92
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,929
because I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen some good comments</font>

93
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,799
come in on the emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone out</font>

94
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:13,859
so far it one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to be</font>

95
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:15,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">clear about is commenting on the when</font>

96
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're come into putting in comments for</font>

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,729
the call for adoption i still think we

98
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:20,128
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear that we're we're</font>

99
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning to adopt the document so all of</font>

100
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,909
those comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> are great but if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

101
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,289
you think the document should not be

102
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,119
adopted you need to be very clear about

103
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:29,669
that and that's what I meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> by silence</font>

104
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:31,709
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a consent</font>

105
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,589
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some folks are being</font>

106
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,579
clear about that and otherwise it would

107
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,569
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if we could be a little bit</font>

108
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:41,279
clearer so the two questions from Brian

109
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,619
one was did anybody have an issue with

110
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,359
the formatting this formatting dates

111
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:48,419
back to the way dave mills did some

112
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:50,399
things and the second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he</font>

113
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:55,859
had was are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any new mode 6</font>

114
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:57,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands that need to be incorporated so</font>

115
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:59,579
does anybody have any direct feedback on

116
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:02,360
that now otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> brian will be sending</font>

117
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,360
this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list</font>

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on shell this addressed the</font>

119
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,660
draft that was that we did the call for

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,570
adoption on addressed the comments that

121
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and Sharon raised previously the</font>

122
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,320
security issues were addressed by that

123
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay so Harlan would rather respond</font>

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:27,330
to the mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> six step by email so that's</font>

125
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:31,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of that the second thing is</font>

126
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:35,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp this has been around for a long</font>

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,039
time and it's never going to be it

128
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,570
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be considered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a certain extent</font>

129
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,000
a living document because<font color="#E5E5E5"> best current</font>

130
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,120
practices will change over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're over obsessing over what</font>

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,560
should be in there so we have issued the

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,150
working group last call it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

back to doing the key exchange /<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly easy enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use words like</font>

complexity this is about mechanism not

228
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,339
about policy so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should give people</font>

what's in the document or no as to

241
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,310
whether water Boston was I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

242
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,769
that it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be productive to have</font>

243
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,508
a discussion about this right now my

244
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:45,519
point is that I would rather see it's

245
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,139
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good to not specify</font>

246
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
these things and leave it to different

247
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:53,410
implementers to decide to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in a</font>

248
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,300
possibly incompatible way in my opinion

249
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,459
it's better to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and specify it</font>

250
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,219
as an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be implemented and</font>

251
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you specify how it's done so that</font>

252
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:12,640
there's huh why do you want that ups in

253
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:16,389
there I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mature what's your use case but</font>

254
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,720
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it doesn't hurt to specify</font>

255
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,069
a minimum set now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and add other options</font>

256
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,600
wants clear use cases have been

257
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,099
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think the question</font>

258
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's being asked is what's the clear</font>

259
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,418
use case for the opt for the option

260
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,159
you're asking to put in flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

261
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:34,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious one also if we're going to</font>

262
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:36,970
be supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls for uh modes one and</font>

263
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,590
two prohibiting it you know if you want

264
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,240
to make the assumption the people would

265
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,399
have to implement this four modes three

266
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,960
and four as a piggyback option unless

267
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,789
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something different</font>

268
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,370
here because of key exchange I i think

269
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:53,470
that the advice from the security

270
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,418
community would be that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

271
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,150
have a use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an option you should</font>

272
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,650
not specify it yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hadn't what</font>

273
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,750
there's a difference between using this

274
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:05,230
out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil bad internet where</font>

275
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:09,220
there's one set of constraints and in an

276
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:12,130
in internal situation where you don't

277
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some of those constraints so it's</font>

278
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,240
fine to not to say don't do this on the

279
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,799
big bad internet it's something else to

280
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,570
say because you can't do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the big</font>

to implement this internally in a more

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,439
friendly environment so I mean I perhaps

285
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,250
this isn't a productive time to have

286
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,350
this conversation but my question back

287
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,360
to you is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still what is your use case</font>

288
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,909
for doing it flexibility is not a use

289
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,370
case

290
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:44,720
say that's it's a condition<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

291
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,919
characteristic aspect it's but it's not

292
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,320
a use case and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what we're</font>

293
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,270
looking for here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is without a use case a</font>

294
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,070
reason why you would want to do this and

295
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,940
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should not specify it yet and</font>

296
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,470
once a use case becomes obvious and we

297
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,810
understand the use case then we can add

298
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,030
the capability or add the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

299
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:06,679
submit it's probably not useful to

300
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,210
discuss this more at this time go ahead

301
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Suresh a couple of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

302
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christian like Eddie hat on I think it's</font>

303
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be incredibly difficult to</font>

304
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,840
justify this like I in do this in my

305
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,060
friendly piece not on the bad internet

306
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,530
into the iesg so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna like</font>

307
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably get hit with like discusses</font>

308
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,670
from all the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eddings like that</font>

309
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,020
away when it gets there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

310
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go there but even before that like</font>

311
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,730
procedurally right Kevin so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

312
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,770
want to like close this once and for all

313
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,940
like do a consensus call on the list and

314
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,790
say like okay like do you want to keep

315
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this or not and if people are agreed</font>

316
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,360
agreed like RF happens and there are

317
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,040
problems in the rough right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm I</font>

318
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,719
think that's probably one way to like

319
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,370
this part from here inside the working

320
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,140
group but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you already</font>

321
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,600
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be difficult in the</font>

322
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,970
iesg to like get this through a security

323
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,919
review I have an issue of a document

324
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,290
right now where people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said like</font>

325
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,810
hey like we have this bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID's like</font>

326
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,250
we can pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mobile IP okay and they</font>

327
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,110
say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this other thing looks like</font>

328
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool we can use this in the</font>

329
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,340
future and people are saying why so the

330
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,070
document is now back in the working

331
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,110
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd saying like okay justify why</font>

332
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,810
you need this so I see this having the

333
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,719
same path in the iesg<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay saying like</font>

334
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,879
so I don't see a point Harlan but it's

335
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,940
probably left to a point when it's

336
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,040
needed like Anna's like daniel said like

337
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,930
it's nothing preventing there's no must

338
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,940
not use anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so I I think it's</font>

339
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,350
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and we can probably write</font>

340
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,480
another draft which describes how this

341
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,669
works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then take that independently</font>

342
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,620
in the working group okay that one yes

343
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,110
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question then are we</font>

344
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,389
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the dtls transfer in</font>

345
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,639
extension fields over an NTP packet or

346
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:48,980
we assume that ntp packets are going to

347
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,470
travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a dtls connection if you are</font>

348
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,130
using if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using NTS 26</font>

349
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,740
rows one and two then then you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

350
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,419
be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the ntp port you will</font>

351
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,150
be doing that on a detail a sport for

352
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,510
NTS and sending those ntp packets as

353
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:08,360
application data house ntp supposed to

354
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:15,379
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going over a secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font>

355
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:18,979
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed what that did you not for</font>

356
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">me i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i heard you</font>

357
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:25,400
perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't understand the</font>

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:28,370
question why would it not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're</font>

359
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,049
assuming a foundation how does ntp know

360
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,059
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the packets at sending</font>

361
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:35,658
are going over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DTLS protected</font>

362
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:43,820
connection because the ntp demon is

363
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:46,880
setting up the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so ntp</font>

364
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,970
would open up a connection on some other

365
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,549
well-known port and it would use that

366
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:56,270
port for detail it would do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls</font>

367
00:21:52,549 --> 00:22:00,350
exchange over that port to a remote MTP

368
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:16,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's how it would know yes okay</font>

369
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:20,899
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next slide there's still</font>

370
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:26,120
some smaller issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which has to be</font>

371
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">done yet that one point is for ITP</font>

372
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:34,129
service which are using a load balancer

373
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:37,390
there has to be some some language to

374
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:40,000
describe how this has to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

375
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:44,330
then also in the security considerations

376
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">section stairs or the subject still the</font>

subjects section angles of ntp pools

378
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:58,700
which shall be reworked also yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> MVP that entity pool section so this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is carrying over from</font>

but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the current language in</font>

384
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,490
there simply saying you won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">use NTS for MVP pools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

387
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,149
this for wide adoption because MVP pools

some discussion of what direction we're

398
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,610
heading there so that I can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

relevant sentences in the security

establish trust in their members of a

cool wouldn't it and then there's a

caused um we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clean up</font>

468
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,470
administrative stuff on adoptions that

469
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,240
we hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> issued and so I issued a call</font>

470
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:21,740
for adoption on the previous document

471
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:26,510
today and so I need to fix all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

476
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,820
about on the word on the call for

477

adoption i don't know if they're out if

478
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,970

479
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,840
if or if you think that so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

480
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,870
for you is you're the one who's

481
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,939

sec debra byrne review now or do you

483

484
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,650
actually just said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to change</font>

485
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah i'm the the mac frantically draft</font>

486
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,860
we talk about um yeah so much my

487
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,100
compliments the mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists are that</font>

488
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,559
or that I support immediate adoption of

489
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,449
draft however in the time between

490
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,010
adoption and when we actually push it

491
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:17,200
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of the working group I expect</font>

492
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,429
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that the document will have to</font>

493
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,490
undergo a substantial<font color="#CCCCCC"> change of</font>

494
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:23,740
character from being a broad discussion

495
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,600
of possibilities and alternatives and

496
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,890
trade-offs to actually being a

497
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,840
specification for using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a yes CMAC for</font>

498
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,760
for legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac and this is where I</font>

499
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,320
caused the confusion because the link to

500
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,520
the document you saw is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

501
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,770
did with all of the options and

502
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,820
discussion but the actual one that has

503
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,500
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopted is is the specification oh</font>

504
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,240
I guess I must have read the wrong

505
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,480
version then you absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and it's</font>

506
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,390
all it's all my fault because I pushed

507
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong buttons and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tracker</font>

508
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:58,179
so um I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a quick</font>

509
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,010
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group they</font>

510
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,780
already adopted working group document

511
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,870
it's very short that does an actual

512
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,399
recommendation oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think then you're</font>

513
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,370
right Suresh we could get a sector

514
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,750
review of this what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to orders</font>

515
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,399
like you know we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing late</font>

516
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,410
right like so the earlier in the process

517
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,910
like you because like especially I'm

518
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,860
doing this for security related stuff

519
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in like I'm just trying to get the</font>

520
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,760
like bad news if there's any earlier I'd

521
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,980
like so and if people care it because

522
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,419
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FRG so and said there's</font>

523
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,450
like something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will clear the way</font>

524
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,010
like for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC a DS like at some point</font>

525
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,020
when it gets there so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

526
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good if you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so just</font>

527
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,280
like I'll wait for you to signal me

528
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,629
somewhere and then right I just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

529
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,178

530
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,520
mess that I created earlier today but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

532
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:51,460

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,950
there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a push for we put out the</font>

540
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,390
call for adoption

541
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,920
[Music]

542
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,300
cut a few people have commented on it

543

545
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,399
opposition to adoption arm as far as the

546
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,190
cut as far as the revising the content

547
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,030
of the document Harlan had a few

548

551
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:48,850
armed and then he also<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted a section</font>

552
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:51,460
on randomization removed which I

553
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,949
currently don't see a reason for and

554
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've replied in the list asking</font>

555
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,020
asking for clarification on the reasons

556
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,250

Harlan hey there uh as written I believe

562
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:27,100
the doctor if the purpose of this

563
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is to do exactly what it says</font>

564
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,449
then it does exactly what it says I

565
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,679
think it's over each and that's why I

566
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:38,440
want those should or shells change to

567
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">maize because that behavior is</font>

568
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,630
inappropriate in various contexts and

569
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,690
prohibiting that behavior is

570
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:49,390
counterproductive Paul gear had a

571
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment about a wider use case of why</font>

572
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,500
doing this behavior will make it more

573
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,990
difficult to find operational problems

574
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,740
in the wild as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third paragraph</font>

575
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,750
of the randomization I'm pretty sure my

576
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,070
original comments say exactly what

577
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,250
they're supposed to while I remain

578
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,370
polite so again that third paragraph

579
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:13,080
should go because it's exactly for the

580
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:18,040
reasons why I mentioned so on so um

581
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,600
anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the first point dude do</font>

582
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any objection to changing those</font>

583
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,070
must shoulds on and on the second point

584
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:29,580
you've stated that the paragraph is I

585
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:33,570
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> income</font>

586
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,939
reenactors inflammatory yeah i'm i'm up

587
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,320
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm used to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm unclear on what</font>

588
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,380
justifies any of those three statements

589
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,370
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing what is inaccurate and</font>

590
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,870
which statements do you find

591
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,479
inflammatory and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you temper</font>

592
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:52,350
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not about to do that with you</font>

593
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:56,130
in public<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go back to the</font>

594
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:59,070
first point Harlan are you opposed to

595
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:08,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption of this draft uh with with</font>

596
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:11,670
look at which yes are you opposed to a

597
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:14,100
draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> that addresses these issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no are</font>

598
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:19,350
there any other drafts on the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

599
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:21,000
addresses these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so is this a</font>

600
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:24,389
reasonable starting point that we can

601
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,159
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward with absolutely okay so</font>

602
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,500
then you are not opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adoption</font>

603
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:34,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this draft wait a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font>

604
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:38,880
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dre I am opposed to the draft</font>

605
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:42,900
as written right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I said are you up</font>

606
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,120
I'm not opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conception to the</font>

607
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,040
to the conceptual purpose and with the

608
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,480
changes I offered I'm perfectly happy

609
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,730
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> description so Harlan like I</font>

610
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,560
hear what he's saying and I understood

611
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,930
this like as supporting adoption right

612
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,549
so once the document gets adopted it

613
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,529
goes under working group change control

614
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,120
so it's not like Daniel making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

615
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,290
changes anymore it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

616
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,290
group making changes so at that point

617
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,270
once it's adopted like you are as much

618
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,370
as a party to it as like Daniel right

619
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:15,150
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> any its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're free to argue the</font>

620
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:16,680
changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph right so so that is</font>

621
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process right adoption means like</font>

622
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,919
does the Virgin Group wanna work on this

623
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,990
problem not whether this is going to be

624
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,450
the end result of the whatever document

625
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:30,359
comes out so as that is that clear yes

626
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is okay perfect okay thank you okay</font>

627
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,870
so uh

628
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,380
at this point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

629
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,630
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether the language</font>

630
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:45,650
should be should muster may to the

631
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list and perhaps we will try to</font>

632
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,750
craft a conversation that the interim to

633
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:58,910
deal with the second issue I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

634
00:35:50,750 --> 00:36:00,440
encourage you Harlan to you can't say

635
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,379
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> is incomplete you need to say</font>

636
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,980
what's missing so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

637
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more errors I guess it's not do you</font>

638
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,270
want me to not do that now well you

639
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to do it well I'm happy to do</font>

640
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:18,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> later or an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email yeah it doesn't</font>

641
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,390
have to be now but it had it had it has

642
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,160
to be somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> public for the</font>

643
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:26,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group to review this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

644
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">listener right so yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written your</font>

645
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:34,790
house thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> item</font>

646
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have on the list we don't actually</font>

647
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:40,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any updates on Harlan this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

648
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,230
ref ID document that you and Sharon did

649
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,200
and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to follow up</font>

650
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:48,710
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> either view on where we are with</font>

651
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,589
this and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if Sharon I don't</font>

652
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:55,310
think Sharon's actually I know she has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

653
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,660
issue I'm not aware of any changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

654
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:02,230
the documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think need to be</font>

655
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:07,759
made um so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that this one is</font>

656
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:09,350
ready to progress my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

657
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,840
could ostensibly do a working group last

658
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:21,440
call on this one so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next item is the</font>

659
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:23,560
yang data modules are the a pager did

660
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,560
you

661
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,569
[Music]

662
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:33,419
hi Aunt Ruth this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

663
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:36,420
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP working group I was recruited</font>

664
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,490
by other authors to come and like join

665
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,400
this effort because I have some yang

666
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,529
models under my belt and but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

667
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">started I actually coded a bit of ntp</font>

668
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,690
the auto key features where I was just

669
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,370
an implementer so kind of combining the

670
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,440
two experience and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write and</font>

671
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,330
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the yang model was already</font>

672
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,320
there finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what are the issues in</font>

673
00:37:54,330 --> 00:38:02,310
the and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets moving</font>

674
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,270
so i think animal was the one who

675
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,400
presented this some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas ago and the</font>

676
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,590
main updates i will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and</font>

677
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,630
what are the next steps that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

678
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,630
mind with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to this young model</font>

679
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,610
yeah we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

680
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,580
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this young model what does</font>

681
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,890
this do it's basically a man away for us

682
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,500
to manage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp both the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client side</font>

683
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:31,230
as well as the server side it has the

684
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,900
mechanism to on figure as well as to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

685
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:37,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time state most of the features</font>

686
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,120
for ntp for are covered auto key was

687
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,129
something that we recently added<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

688
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,200
incomplete as of now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still</font>

689
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,720
some changes needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done there</font>

690
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,080
there is a new author easier from it

691
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">ericsson and this is just a new edition</font>

692
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,750
before the ITF so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publishing a</font>

693
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:58,529
new version later based on the inputs

694
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,020
and other things as well okay to do that

695
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,210
so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes we made sure</font>

696
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we could change the port because</font>

697
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,290
this is some feature that some of the

698
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,410
vendors have where they allow the ntp

699
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:12,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">port to change to a non-standard put if</font>

700
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:15,299
needed so that configuration is allowed

701
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,400
earlier in the document we were having a

702
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,500
mechanism for only a single trusted key

703
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,710
so that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed to a list a</font>

704
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,210
container for auto key has been added so

705
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,210
we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that to keep</font>

706
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,040
enhancing the authentication part a

707
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,020
little bit of structure has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

708
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,400
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will talk</font>

709
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,680
about how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are handling the</font>

710
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">association type and the interface</font>

711
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,580
container that we have the list of ntp

712
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
interfaces how

713
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,680
handling the many cast kind of feature

714
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,839
those things we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding him so this</font>

715
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a straightforward thing allow you to</font>

716
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP port by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default the</font>

717
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,300
ATP port is always there but you you are

718
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,500
allowed to change to non-standard this

719
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,840
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the security</font>

720
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,870
considerations as well so we will make

721
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure to handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that part as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

722
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,339
this way so what's the next change the

723
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:10,440
next changes the earlier this was just a

724
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,630
single container but the star would mean

725
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,750
that it's a list now so we have changes

726
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,530
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted key and maintaining key ID</font>

727
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:22,050
actually there is recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in the RTG</font>

728
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,970
WG as well about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain handling</font>

729
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,990
so we in the next update we will make

730
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:31,080
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use the RTG WG motor and</font>

731
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:33,689
keep it aligned a container for auto key

732
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">also has been added right now we are</font>

733
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,580
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypt hash here we have to</font>

734
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,630
still figure it out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the right</font>

735
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:43,410
reference that you need to use and

736
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,050
whether it should be the RTG RTG<font color="#E5E5E5"> wg1 or</font>

737
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,609
whether we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the net mod 1 so</font>

738
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,710
that discussions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having with some</font>

739
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:53,940
people during this ITF and you will

740
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:56,280
clarify that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a regarding</font>

741
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">association type so earlier they were</font>

742
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,630
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> containers so that we have</font>

743
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplified by having an association type</font>

744
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,400
and you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> association list define</font>

745
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> association type as either server</font>

746
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and pool based on the different ntp</font>

747
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,550
modes and then manage this association

748
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:18,670
and an auto key container has also been

749
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">added with respect to</font>

750
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:25,210
face again some reorganizations have

751
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:27,940
been done basically we combine broadcast

752
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,160
multicast server together rather than

753
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:34,810
maintaining a separate as per the ntp

754
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">mode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five and auto key and the many cast</font>

755
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:41,759
client and many cast server related

756
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:43,990
details have been added<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still plan to</font>

757
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,590
reorganize this a little bit based on

758
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:49,779
the some ideas from the yanks best

759
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:54,970
practices which we are planning to do it

760
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:58,540
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> update so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh if I remember</font>

761
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:00,580
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last ITF I think one question</font>

762
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">what an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ill asked was that is this</font>

763
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,140
something that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP working group</font>

764
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,540
wants to do coming from the when decide

765
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:10,779
we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are using yang models</font>

766
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,580
for most of our protocols and for

767
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,040
configuring of our devices as well as

768
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:18,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manageability things so we feel</font>

769
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,380
that entity fits into that definition

770
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:24,610
and this could be one or another way for

771
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to configure ntp and enhance the</font>

772
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,290
manageability part of ntp and we were

773
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,080
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time we could get</font>

774
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:33,790
adopted and then work and up keep

775
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,470
updating the document under the umbrella

776
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:40,840
of the working group rather than as a

777
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:49,629
private draft thank you are there any

question questions suresh krisshnan

channeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danny Meyer on on me dekho he</font>

780
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,650
says her<font color="#E5E5E5"> moeraki so would you like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lab</font>

781
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:02,020
rat<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit Danny he decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what oh</font>

782
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,150
sorry he's in the piercer wait hey Danny

783
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,530
me just says start over because I'd

784
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,420
inverse tonight water can't because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

785
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,330
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group has already</font>

786
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:14,020
decided that order key is very badly

787
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:15,910
broken and needs to be replaced so doing

788
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:19,060
anything with all the key right now on

789
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:27,580
in your yang model is early is a waste

790
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:28,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and resources</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks for the</font>

791
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:33,720
input

792
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:36,180
okay Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Danny uh Harlan either oh</font>

793
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,299
good there we are uh yeah so with that

794
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:45,210
in mind this means we also need to add

795
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:47,999
NTS in there and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other trick is is</font>

796
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:50,839
there any working suitably licensed

797
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:57,868
software that demonstrates this

798
00:43:50,839 --> 00:44:00,029
implementation I didn't understand what

799
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:03,799
you meant by that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

800
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:06,479
implemented this yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have</font>

801
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">currently we have a proprietary version</font>

802
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:10,919
of our young and as you know bunch of

803
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:14,190
vendors already are using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> confer</font>

804
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,349
configuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTP and other CL eyes and</font>

805
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,140
other stuff so our aim<font color="#CCCCCC"> to coming to ITF</font>

806
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:21,900
and doing this as a so not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

807
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,999
proprietary young models anymore coming

808
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,190
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of standardizing those young</font>

809
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,129
models and once that work is done we

810
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,900
will implement those right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

811
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,880
probate on a proprietary version we're

812
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,829
coming to the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making changes and</font>

813
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,150
once those changes are standardized we

814
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:38,670
have to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our vendors and</font>

815
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,219
implement those young models so if you

816
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,989
are asking this model in its in its

817
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:46,469
current form is completely implemented

818
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">no but parts of its are implemented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

819
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:51,479
well there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> two there's two issues here</font>

820
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:55,319
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the gang model itself the other</font>

821
00:44:51,479 --> 00:45:00,118
is the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement the monitoring</font>

822
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:02,249
and control functions that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

823
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,950
netconf<font color="#E5E5E5"> andres con so that's definitely</font>

824
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:08,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">already there we are just writing the</font>

825
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:10,890
yang models and using the existing

826
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:13,979
protocols this is going to work so

827
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for extra functions at</font>

828
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:18,328
the net conf in the restaurant place or

829
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,509
any other monitoring tool that can use

830
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:24,229
young models<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a bunch of</font>

831
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:24,229
glue missing

832
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so would you like to have let like</font>

833
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:35,910
us to add a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more information</font>

834
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:39,240
of how a young model is used ah know if

835
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:41,040
something if it's appropriate I'd like

836
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get an email from folks and start</font>

837
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,700
participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> and working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you guys</font>

838
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's what about uh Harlan this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

839
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,430
Richard like would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like me to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

840
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,690
shot at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font>

841
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:55,500
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll take</font>

842
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:58,140
a shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it please okay so just like</font>

843
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,490
ntp implementations right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there</font>

844
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,920
needs to be something between like

845
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:04,229
setting some variable like using yang

846
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,180
you said something using the yang model

847
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,770
but something needs to happen to make to

848
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,060
activate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the implementation I</font>

849
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,440
think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question Harlan's</font>

850
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,630
asking God is there like open source

851
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,210
implementation does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make sense like</font>

852
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:16,680
I think that causes questions not that

853
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,560
actually yang model it's all like what

854
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,029
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it connectivity between the what's</font>

855
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,600
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the yang model and what</font>

856
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:27,060
happens in like a ntp implication so if

857
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a device at I am implementing this</font>

858
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,500
young model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to use the</font>

859
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,470
protocols like net convent risk on to

860
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,470
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data in form of XML in case</font>

861
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,870
if it is a net conf or if in case of

862
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,700
rest conf it will be in JSON format so

863
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:45,330
based on the yang format<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will receive</font>

864
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:48,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data I would have a general a young</font>

865
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,610
parser which can pass any xml data based

866
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,040
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> young file this kind of code for</font>

867
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,110
mostly if all vendors is already genric

868
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,029
it's not dependent on a particular young

869
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,540
model so we write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a generator and</font>

870
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:02,220
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use support a young file there</font>

871
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,560
are tools like for example if you look

872
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">at open daylight there are yang tools</font>

873
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,759
that can generate the parses

874
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,610
automatically so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually use that</font>

875
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of auto-generated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so that's why</font>

876
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,330
this kind of manageability works very

877
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,310
easily and if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

878
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,360
young file or a revision to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> young</font>

879
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:23,370
file the glue code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite easy to</font>

880
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,780
update it's not a big problem and

881
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,750
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is something that is</font>

882
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,850
already defined in and already working

883
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,910
for rest of the other young models it's

884
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:36,299
not something ntp young specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

885
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,430
two questions first i will say that i'm

886
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,730
not particularly i'm not very familiar

887
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,149
with yangyang

888
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:47,020
at all are their transactions

889
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:48,550
capabilities with this yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next at</font>

890
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:52,090
some point we've got to find a way to

891
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:53,440
take the yang data transmission so that

892
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,420
we know what configuration needs to

893
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,720
happen and that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be translated</font>

894
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">into something that queries or manages</font>

895
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:09,040
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP instance yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Harlin yeah</font>

896
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:12,430
okay hi Harlan jared montz Haram hai uh

897
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,020
can we take this part of the discussion

898
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,940
offline I can maybe show you some yang

899
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,190
models and how they interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

900
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,109
platforms first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that might you</font>

901
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,720
understand it a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

902
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:26,549
thank you there's also a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

903
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yakov online does this replace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ntp q</font>

904
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,470
well there's no leaving for replacing

905
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:35,859
anything is just another tool yeah okay

906
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:37,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah cough the answer's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright is</font>

907
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:42,400
there anybody opposed to the working

908
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:44,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">group adopting this work all right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

909
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:54,880
will properly issue a call for adoption

910
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:55,410
on the mailing list thank you and so the

911
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,359
last thing

912
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,940
listed was any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> business we sort of</font>

913
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,828
have dropped all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the there was a</font>

914
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of drafts related to the</font>

915
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:07,319
extension fields and when are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

916
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:11,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about those or when are we going</font>

917
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:13,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward with him that was what I</font>

918
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:20,670
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting ready to talk about wow</font>

919
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:22,649
you're awesome um so there was I mean

920
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:26,240
there are a number of drafts and we had

921
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,240
talked about combining some of them

922
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Harlan do you want to so there's none of</font>

923
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:46,109
the extension graphs have<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently been</font>

924
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:49,980
adopted do you want to summarize what

925
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:54,150
each of them are again or how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give</font>

926
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:56,819
me a list or I can go look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a list go</font>

927
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,170
to go to data tracker into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntp</font>

928
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:02,640
working group look at the bottom where

929
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:05,160
it says document Jerry I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

930
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,839
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be best if he's dead issued</font>

931
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,670
call for adoption for those on the list

932
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:13,440
as opposed to trying to adjudicate them

933
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:14,730
all here um we we could do that there's

934
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a fair amount of discussion on a</font>

935
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,579
few of them the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we could</font>

936
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">t up and properly prepare for this</font>

937
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:26,490
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the at the April</font>

938
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,859
interim<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font>

939
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:31,529
do that because it I'm still confused

940
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,509
about the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drafts and what we</font>

941
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:39,240
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of it okay all</font>

942
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:44,359
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

943
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:50,399
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the NTP agenda and so now</font>

944
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:53,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">tick tock so there's two items on the</font>

945
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:58,980
tick-tock agenda the first one is the

946
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">working groups oh here it is there we go</font>

947
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:06,059
working group status so the first thing

948
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we actually have a new RFC I know</font>

949
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,349
he's here but

950
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:13,069
he's not he's over in the deterministic

951
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:15,480
networking working group but tiles

952
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:19,160
multipath time synchronization has been

953
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">published as of January it's RFC 80 39</font>

954
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,899
so that's a big step forward for that

955
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:28,579
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have the</font>

956
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:31,920
1588 move in the RFC editor queue and

957
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:36,299
with deep thanks to suresh and the

958
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:41,190
document editors patients we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have got</font>

959
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that moved forward the enterprise</font>

960
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:47,910
profile a PTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise profile it had</font>

961
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,099
completed a working group last call and

962
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:54,328
then in conversations with doug arnold

963
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:59,279
who is at an IT meeting this week and

964
00:51:54,329 --> 00:52:01,740
not hear it it completed the working

965
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:03,480
group class called but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some</font>

966
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,319
updates that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make based on</font>

967
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:13,079
some changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have happened in 1588</font>

968
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:14,990
so the I Triple E 1588 document has has

969
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,779
completed its first working group ballot

970
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:20,700
and so the we're so we need to we need

971
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:22,740
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an author update on that one and</font>

972
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do an author update and then we</font>

973
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,220
will reissue a very short<font color="#CCCCCC"> working your</font>

974
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,329
class call it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a</font>

975
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:34,439
while and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoops the last thing</font>

976
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:37,009
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1588 over mpls this has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

977
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,619
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our docket for a while</font>

978
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:48,839
awaiting an editor update and we don't

979
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that editor update Oh Harlan's in</font>

980
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:56,160
the queue again hold on sorry Harlan go

981
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:59,910
ahead I need the queue over here go

982
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:03,149
ahead Harlan maybe it's me in the queue

983
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:06,149
oh yeah

984
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:10,290
in the queue yeah you're so used to

985
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:15,800
having Harlan in the queue um ji<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristin</font>

986
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:19,320
yeah just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1588 over mpls one I</font>

987
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,200
think at this point it is the right

988
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:24,000
thing to do to drop it since the draft

989
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,250
which came afterwards which is more

990
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,620
generic remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg mere skis wrath</font>

991
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:34,920
actually passed working group last call

992
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:36,540
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls working group right and this</font>

993
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:41,810
one was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be experimental in any</font>

994
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:46,920
event so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we shall drop it</font>

995
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:50,730
anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm booting you out</font>

996
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah cough Harlan hi there so at some</font>

997
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:57,690
point I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss how we want the</font>

998
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:59,250
documents to look moving forward this

999
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,540
goes to things like do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1000
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:04,920
separate proposals for like each

1001
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:07,770
extension field things we want to have

1002
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,870
clumps of extension field proposals or

1003
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:13,140
do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something like have</font>

1004
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:15,089
higher level you know have have high

1005
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,549
level documents to describe each thing

1006
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:26,570
and then we augment them as we make

1007
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:26,570
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for things did that make sense</font>

1008
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:33,910
it does make

1009
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:38,980
we had talked it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boston about a set</font>

1010
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:40,930
of groupings<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah but that was like</font>

1011
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:43,540
so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ref ID proposals that</font>

1012
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,890
has like two or three ref ID proposals

1013
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,840
in it but there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

1014
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,549
extension field once and then there's

1015
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,140
the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we've separated the mac</font>

1016
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,300
processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from something else with</font>

1017
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,339
extension fields and we've got the

1018
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:59,230
hilarity that we have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet discussed</font>

1019
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:05,050
about the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal I hate</font>

1020
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:06,280
and I propose some changes to and you

1021
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is how do we want to</font>

1022
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,820
do this moving forward we want to go

1023
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,580
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in chunks or do we want to</font>

1024
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,740
have some you know add this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1025
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,100
section add this to the exception of 59

1026
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:20,379
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know to add some new</font>

1027
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,700
fields under extension fields or the

1028
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:28,930
same thing will probably be true with

1029
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:30,040
mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 going moving forward so I think</font>

1030
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,569
there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of</font>

1031
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,829
homework and organization that we need

1032
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:37,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to have this conversation</font>

1033
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:39,160
productively and I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

1034
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:41,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharon has involved in some bit kind of</font>

1035
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to have her there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and also</font>

1036
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,369
I know that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ongoing</font>

1037
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:52,900
disagreement between you and towel on

1038
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:56,680
the the clarification to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extension</font>

1039
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,630
field that is made oh please<font color="#E5E5E5"> God let's</font>

1040
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:06,700
not focus on tell I've just scream it to

1041
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:10,000
Danny about this too I realize there's

1042
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,439
an ongoing disagreement there are

1043
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,910
several issues and in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1044
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,079
productive conversation we need to have

1045
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,308
the conversation a little bit more

1046
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,569
organized and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1047
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,270
parties in the room and we might as well

1048
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:24,040
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's effective given the</font>

1049
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of time oh yeah absolutely yeah</font>

1050
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,220
we've gone in circles on this I'm tired

1051
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,290
of going in circles I don't want to have

1052
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,118
the conversation until we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get all of the</font>

1053
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:33,520
key participants in the room together<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1054
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,049
was expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes toward if</font>

1055
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,460
we're going to work toward an April

1056
00:56:35,049 --> 00:56:40,390
interim meeting where we discuss these

1057
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:44,490
things it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help if if it will</font>

1058
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:47,250
help if we can get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision or about</font>

1059
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:50,770
the overall direction we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proceed</font>

1060
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:54,579
so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looking at you know submitting</font>

1061
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:58,049
clumps of new rfcs to add in different

1062
00:56:54,579 --> 00:57:01,660
proposals or we looking at updating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1063
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:03,400
existing RFC so that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when a</font>

1064
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,589
time come to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new extension field</font>

1065
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,780
we add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new section to the existing</font>

1066
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:17,600
document under supported extension

1067
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:19,340
fields so you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

1068
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,779
helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a single document on</font>

1069
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:26,680
extension fields and to rev it every

1070
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:29,690
time a new extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> field is defined</font>

1071
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,700
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or have or let the single</font>

1072
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:34,190
protocol document have a section on

1073
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:42,020
extension fields and rev that every time

1074
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:43,910
I just personally I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't</font>

1075
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,230
like the hunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know look at the</font>

1076
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,609
top and see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different places</font>

1077
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,770
where somebody may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done something</font>

1078
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:50,660
and then every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to look at it</font>

1079
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:52,670
go through each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those again to</font>

1080
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:55,029
see if it's been revved I'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1081
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:58,430
a single place to look for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1082
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:00,980
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a rev of</font>

1083
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:03,290
the base scored the base ntp

1084
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:08,170
specification that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be my</font>

1085
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:08,170
preference but that's my preference

1086
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:17,919
that's not the least bit terrifying

1087
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:17,920
[Laughter]

1088
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">common good and bad sides on each of</font>

1089
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,240
these and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss</font>

1090
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:28,040
it all right right so is there anybody

1091
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:34,910
in the room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has an opinion on any</font>

1092
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:37,460
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i oppose any approach which</font>

1093
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:40,609
would treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of extensions as</font>

1094
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,740
closed the entire idea of having the

1095
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:46,450
exhibition fields is that you can simply

1096
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:50,029
but simply register your extension and

1097
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:51,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain to maintain that maintain</font>

1098
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,610
that document separately from everything

1099
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:56,680
else that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to read the</font>

1100
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:59,420
course back on and leave open the

1101
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,180
possibility of extensions in the private

1102
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,440
use range where if you don't if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

1103
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:07,730
this and you don't recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1104
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:09,410
ignore it that's already done if you

1105
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:13,400
don't recognize any tension filled you

1106
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:15,080
ignore it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're gonna make</font>

1107
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">something an extension field you gotta</font>

1108
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:22,940
document it ah right so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1109
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point that yeah so if something is</font>

1110
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the private use reins and nobody</font>

1111
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:31,040
here is proposing that we use it and

1112
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:35,089
leave it undocumented um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I but I</font>

1113
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I oppose the idea of a vase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a vase of</font>

a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> door of a single directory that</font>

1115
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,180
gives us a point of true if there's two

as a sec well aside from the iono

1117

registry which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think which i</font>

1118
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:48,200
think is the is the directory you're

00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:50,060
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you see a river</font>

1120
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,230
point of the you can you can either look

1121
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,610
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which should point to let us</font>

1122
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,500
read or you can just watch the list

1123
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:58,310
traffic for 14 when something is updated

put everything into a single document

1126
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,850
defeats the point of extensions all

1127
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:19,339
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we clearly disagree on</font>

1128
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:22,339
this one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not I guess I'm not</font>

1129
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">convinced that I can provide you at this</font>

1130
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time the guidance on how to do</font>

1131
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:31,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I think revving the course back</font>

1132
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:34,790
every time is is not the way we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1133
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,890
go I think perhaps a single document

1134
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:39,380
related to all of the extension field

1135
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,940
types of issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition of</font>

1136
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,610
new extension fields could potentially

1137
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:45,110
be done the other thing yet to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1138
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,480
about is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are other things</font>

1139
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:49,550
people have suggested changing to the

1140
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:55,640
core specification and we haven't opened

1141
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:56,900
that up to do that um yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1142
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,750
track<font color="#CCCCCC"> down everything can be frustrating</font>

1143
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:02,390
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just make sure the RFC numbers</font>

1144
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,890
in the registry and look at one spot and

1145
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,080
then it's a table<font color="#CCCCCC"> of contents toward</font>

1146
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:10,279
where the where else I think opening up

1147
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:12,620
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc really bad want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1148
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,100
stable and trying to collect all the

1149
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,000
extensions once father's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

1150
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:23,990
counterintuitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the way everything</font>

1151
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:27,440
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think one or a small set</font>

1152
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:33,200
of drafts is the guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1153
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think combining</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1154
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,359
don't think we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a separate draft</font>

1155
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:40,490
for every extension field thank you

1156
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:43,460
where we can coalesce and that would be

1157
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:44,689
better but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't as rich says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

1158
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we should</font>

1159
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:52,579
read the base specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1160
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:58,730
I'm pushing the red button Harlan you're

1161
01:01:52,579 --> 01:02:01,400
going out of the queue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that</font>

1162
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:07,250
brings us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of so we were on</font>

1163
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:12,650
actually the tick-tock stuff and there

1164
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:17,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our the authors of the tick-tock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1165
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:20,869
1588 yang module here can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bring up</font>

1166
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:24,130
that bring to download the slides for

1167
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:24,130
the yang module fur

1168
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,010
please stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1169
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,730
ok

1170
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm just going as soon as this</font>

1171
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:43,350
comes up so I don't see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> editors of</font>

1172
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:45,540
this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here anywhere so so</font>

1173
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:48,810
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a yang model that's</font>

1174
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:50,400
the corollary to the mid module that we

1175
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about that's now in the RFC</font>

1176
01:03:50,400 --> 01:04:00,930
editors q if you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide</font>

1177
01:03:52,610 --> 01:04:04,550
and this is the hierarchy that they've

1178
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:08,779
defined you go to the next slide and

1179
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are the summary of the changes</font>

1180
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:19,260
there is an open source module for this

1181
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:26,550
it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on github go to the next</font>

1182
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:28,860
slide here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps the this</font>

1183
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:30,360
work is being so one of the authors at

1184
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,860
the top that you noted was Rodney

1185
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,620
Cummings and Rodney Cummings is heavily

1186
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:37,680
involved in the actively 1588 work and

1187
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,210
the current revision of i triple e 15 it

1188
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,270
is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the definition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> datasets</font>

1189
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:45,770
that would support whatever the

1190
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:48,960
underlying management model would be

1191
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case of 1588 you have the</font>

1192
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,320
SNMP based management you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang and</font>

1193
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:57,270
there's also native management within

1194
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:59,670
fifteen eighty 80 and he's here I'm just

1195
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:08,820
crucifying your presentation so you can

1196

1200
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to go over there but you can</font>

module to simplify is structure we we

1212
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,700
introduced several new types such as

1224
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:26,080
interface that we are added so it will

1225
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:28,990
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very convenient ever you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

question of the the additions do you

1235
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:08,430

1236
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,589
put those additions in you want to do

1237
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the last call that's good</font>

closely coordinated with Ron Rodney in

1243
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:30,210
the 1588 community okay and the lessons

1244
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,759
learned in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1588 mill we will also</font>

1245
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:35,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply to this as far as getting that the</font>

01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:11,910
we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also send it out to the 1588</font>

1255
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,319
community we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably wait just a</font>

1256
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:22,278
tiny bit so that they can finish their

1257

side meeting if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1263
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:41,729
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room at the end we can talk</font>

1264
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:45,120
about when and where to protectively do

1265
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:46,379
that there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

1266
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,729
discussion on the mailing list today

1267
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:52,259
about a virtual interim I think what we

1268
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:54,059
proved between the last meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

1269
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:56,699
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this is a working group</font>

1270
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,020
that is a little bit more effective if

1271
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:00,599
we do have the occasional virtual

1272
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,340
interim in between so we are currently

1273
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,469
targeting having two virtual interims

1274
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:08,400
between now and the next meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

get one and I've proposed some<font color="#E5E5E5"> April</font>

1279
01:10:17,519 --> 01:10:21,929
dates on the mailing list so people

1280
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:24,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick look at that given</font>

1281
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:27,869
the time zones that we cover there's not

1282
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of wiggle room for the time but at</font>

1283
01:10:27,869 --> 01:10:35,730
least the dates we can do and the third

1284
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:37,739
third item is the we really I've said
