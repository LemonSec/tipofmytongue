00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,480
well actually we we should be isn't that

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
already starting time yeah we're at

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
1 30.

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
guys i've

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,960
i think we need to get started

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
starting time approach

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
approaches

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
okay settle a little bit

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
okay thank you all for joining the skip

responsible for this bath elliot as you

13
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,680
can see participates from remote who is

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
my

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,559
co-chair hey elliot

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
he's going to

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
uh post on the questions later on

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
we have two meeting minute takers uh

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
ball and alexey

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
and on on the chat we have uh yogesh

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
monitoring that one and if there are any

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
questions uh

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,439
bringing those to our attention

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
okay

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
so since we are already

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
several days into the meeting i guess i

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
don't need to repeat the note well but

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
um here it is

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
for those who are completely new

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
this is the agenda for today's meeting

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,880
um

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,680
first

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
obviously i would like to welcome you uh

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,890
then we talk i i give a few um

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,079
[Music]

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
details on the background the buff goals

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
and also the

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,840
the interim buff we had

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
earlier followed by

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
a presentation about the problem

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
statement bob is going to give that one

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
cedric we'll speak about the

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
architecture and the terminology

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
we have a short slot on clarifying

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,399
questions related to those terms and

46
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,920
architecture

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
and then we actually get into the meat

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
of things uh milestones program of work

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
and and of course the bigger discussion

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
about

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,080
all the questions that you guys uh may

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
have

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
and finally um roman and i will

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
will go through the the usual bath

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,480
question to see whether there's interest

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
to form a working group on this on this

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
topic

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
okay uh elliot do you you want to

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
say a few words introductory words about

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
yourself as well

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,959
um

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,319
i think you covered the ground really

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,200
well already honest and i'll just add

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,599
that i'm really excited about the bath

65
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,040
i've nev i haven't seen so much energy

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
behind uh the the general concept uh in

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
that in a long long time in terms of you

68
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,599
know you normally have two or three

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
people who are really driving things you

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
guys the the people who have been

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
involved in this even early on are are

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
really a quite a large group of people

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
so there's

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
there's a lot of interest here and i'm

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,519
sure we're gonna do a lot of good work

76
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,519
thanks

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
okay a few a few notes about the the

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
path we had so um

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
mid of june we scheduled an interim buff

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
obviously online

81
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,120
and

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
the usual material is available

83
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,840
i thought it was a good event we had

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,400
good participation uh good discussions

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
we

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
back then we got an agreement on a

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,200
problem statement um we refined the

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,480
problem statement later on on the

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,400
mailing list which bob is going to talk

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
about to make it even crisper

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
um but we also obviously had questions

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
on the deliverable deliverables uh and

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,439
of course uh discussions on the

94
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
solutions which i couldn't then continue

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,239
down on the

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
on the mailing list um i don't want to

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,560
go into the solution discussions because

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
it's a little bit premature obviously at

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
this point in time but uh it was it was

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
good it was good to hear that people are

101
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
actually thinking about the various

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
different ways of incorporating existing

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
technologies

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
and at the end of the buff um quite

105
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
usually we ask on

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
for the level of commitment in form of

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
like who wants to review document right

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
document but also who is committed to do

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
some implementation work

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
knowing of course that we haven't seen

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
the solution so it's a little hard

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
to exactly say what you're going to

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,199
implement but there was a lot of um

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
interest and i was posted on the mailing

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,440
list i tried to capture this here this

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,759
is my sort of assessment on what falls

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,479
into the software supply chain use case

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,280
uh

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
and into other use into other use cases

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
like that are more related to hardware

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
um

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
and but overall what you see it's

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
a lot of people responded to my to my

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
email and expressed um

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
interest to do an implementation but it

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
also showed that even though we focused

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
on the software supply chain use case

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
people have other use cases in mind too

129
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
for that technology which

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,800
obviously quite important and so

131
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,479
we we want to make sure that

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
those are addressed as well we don't

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
want to leave interested bodies behind

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,479
so

135
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,000
we've been working on the problem

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
statement on the mailing list and we've

137
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
seen

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
sort of this tension between sort of

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
writing the text of the problem

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
statement as well as the charter

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,960
in

142
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
tailored to the software supply chain

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,400
use case

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,199
and

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,720
on the other hand have a little bit more

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,960
generic framing to cover also other use

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
cases like hardware

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
for hardware for example i mean like a

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
company like um produces software

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
low-level software but then also

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
obviously as you know has chips uh

152
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
and

153
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
those matter in a supply chain used or

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
in a supply chain in a generic supply

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
chain use case as well

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
so what we had have so far is and you've

157
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,880
seen

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
this information in the material that

159
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
was sent around to the list and it's

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
also included in uploaded to the data

161
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,039
tracker

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
that we have

163
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
proposed charter text which is has a

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
generic framing but it also talks about

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,840
uh

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
the software supply chain use case and

167
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,120
we have a charter at a problem statement

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
that is um

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
tailored to the the software supply

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,240
chain use case

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
so keep that in mind

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
and as a goal we obviously want to find

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
out like what's the level of interest

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
from the wider community here and that's

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
uh

176
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
hopefully we'll find out in the end so

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,599
okay uh i have said enough i think

178
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
and so i want to hand over to to bob to

179
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,758
talk about the problem statement

180
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
okay i have to bring this down a little

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
bit from the hanks uh

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
you can actually uh it's probably better

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
if you just rip it out and hold it in

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
your hand okay um so i'm bob martin

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,960
i work at the mitre corporation as my

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,479
first iatf buff so be kind

187
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
um but

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
what i want to share with you is the

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
energy and excitement

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
we were talking about the discussion

191
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
lists how many here have actually

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
seen some of the traffic on the

193
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
discussion lists

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
okay well hopefully i don't bore you

195
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
with a little bit of recap but basically

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
if we can go to the next slide

197
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,680
um you know

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
supply chains if um you've thought about

199
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,319
them

200
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
really are you know you're bringing

201
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,479
together raw materials

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,280
you're

203
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
putting them into intermediate goods and

204
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
then delivering out to a customer and

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
maybe at some point retiring it

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
that statement

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
is really independent of what kind of

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
thing you're

209
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
creating and that's our general use case

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
but to actually implement this to

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
actually show it works

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
we need to focus on something and so

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,800
we've chosen software because pretty

214
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,759
much all kinds of organizations make use

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
of software either just software by

216
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,520
itself in some cloud or software in a

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
device controlling real interactions

218
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
with the

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,440
universe as it were so

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
you know think about what we're trying

221
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
to do is

222
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
uh just like a notary

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
you know we're trying to

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,000
have a service a capability

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,160
that can witness

226
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,399
you making statements

227
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
or something making statements

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
we're not really caring what the

229
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
statement's about

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,279
just that it's really you or really the

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,000
thing that did it and when they did it

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
so that's kind of our

233
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
generic our

234
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
you know broad

235
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,399
application but we want to focus on the

236
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
software because it's a clear and very

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
dire problem right now and we think it

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
will actually flex through the different

239
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
scenarios we need

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
and that's pretty much what i had as a

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
prepared discussion

242
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
glad to

243
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
have

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,320
people have i things that they'd like to

245
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
know more about the problem statement

246
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,800
is that a clarifying question echo

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
sorry

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,959
i was there we go i was going to

249
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
encourage you to say a few more words

250
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
connecting

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
the notary function to the

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
software um supply chain integrity

253
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
function how do those like can you just

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
like draw the whole okay so so if you

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
think about it um and and we'll

256
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
focus on the software uh scenario for

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
this example um basically you know one

258
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
of the first things someone may want to

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
record is here are the components in the

260
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
software that i am

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
creating so that's a bill of material of

262
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
some sort and so they could uh say okay

263
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
uh you know have this witnessed and have

264
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
evidence that it actually was created at

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
a certain time and and it's you know

266
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,600
noted

267
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,399
now i may also want to say that it was

268
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
built using the following tools and the

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
following configurations

270
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,760
it was witnessed by the following people

271
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
all these statements

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,279
would be

273
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
go through the notary and be recorded

274
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
the notary actually doesn't care what

275
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,519
those statements are but we do to solve

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,839
the you know kind of things like solar

277
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,360
winds or so on

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,880
so the idea here is that if you've done

279
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,399
things to

280
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,200
show the process show the assurance

281
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
gaining

282
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,040
activities done on that software

283
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
that you can bring them in

284
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
and also you can have somebody

285
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
independently third party

286
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,480
come in and uh you know endorse those uh

287
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,320
that yes i physically was there i looked

288
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
at the logs and so it doesn't have to

289
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
just be from the organization that's uh

290
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
making you know first

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,519
party uh claims as it were

292
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
guys um the queue is actually not open

293
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
yet because uh there's a separate slot

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,959
on the

295
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
on the agenda for the

296
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
um

297
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,959
for the clarifying questions um actually

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
after the next presentation

299
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
because there we talk about the

300
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,959
terminology and the architecture i think

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,720
that fits nicely and the problem

302
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
statement i just if you have questions

303
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,959
about the problem statement things that

304
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,440
i didn't that i kind of glossed over in

305
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
my excitement

306
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,200
could um

307
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
did that give me a show of hand if that

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
sort of clarified things for you a

309
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
little bit

310
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,639
mostly but i think i'm still like i mean

311
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
i do understand it from external reasons

312
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,000
but like i just don't understand what

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
the notary is doing there which is to

314
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
say that like you know

315
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,839
well things like like like there's like

316
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,600
the the concept like i witnessed has

317
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
never seen i witnessed you doing some

318
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
specific thing and what the notary in

319
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
this case is doing is saying you said

320
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
something or other which i haven't

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
looked at but i promise you did it at

322
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
this time and so i think i just i hope

323
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,000
you could

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
think about

325
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,959
actually before you answer i think

326
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,800
that's actually part of the next

327
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
presentation that's why i scheduled the

328
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
clarifying questions right afterwards

329
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
because we uh but it's a good point keep

330
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
that in mind cedric uh and also um i

331
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
hope you

332
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
for those who haven't

333
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
been on the list uh

334
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,480
since you haven't seen that

335
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
it's a it's a fairly short uh problem

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
statement and um probably the software

337
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,000
use case is something that many of you

338
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
uh sort of easily relate to because

339
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
you're working on software yourself

340
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,639
you've witnessed some of the attacks and

341
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,519
so

342
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,639
having

343
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,360
um what he said here more visibility

344
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
into

345
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
the whole process into the the process

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
how the different components relate to

347
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
each other who produce what uh is

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,639
obviously quite important to right um

349
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
accomplish accountability

350
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,440
okay so i i think my comments are

351
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,320
directly related to this slide and and

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
uh but i still i still would like to

353
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
follow my my okay

354
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,519
but

355
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
you are not thrown off the queue uh

356
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
mikey so everything is come back in the

357
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
queue at the time no no stay on the

358
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
queue uh so that's good

359
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
yeah just one little aside so

360
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,800
if you think about a notary in the real

361
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
world you know that they can

362
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
you know witness a contract they can

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,880
witness

364
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
your uh signing something they they can

365
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
witness anything you want

366
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,720
and basically they're attesting that you

367
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,199
know it's you doing that

368
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,320
action

369
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,040
they're

370
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,279
they aren't investigating the validity

371
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,639
of that thing

372
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,760
um and and so that's part of the model

373
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
you want to think about i think

374
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
so

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,279
while we're keying up the next speaker

376
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
just as an audio video is anyone else

377
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,639
having trouble hearing based on the

378
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,240
audio from the other room because i

379
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,839
don't know whether it is okay so let me

380
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
go ask him to turn that gain down there

381
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
hello okay um

382
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
yeah so thanks so i'm ceric fournette

383
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,880
from microsoft and uh i'm going to give

384
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,839
you an idea of what we have in the

385
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,320
initial draft architecture

386
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
for skate and

387
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
in part 2 i have one slide explaining

388
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,760
what we think

389
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,839
are the additional security properties

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,880
of

391
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,680
that we get through the notary of the

392
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,719
transparency service

393
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
so let's start with a bit of terminology

394
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
so the

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
the core notion for what we do is the

396
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
claim so that terminator that is

397
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
specific in the context and that is

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
detailed in the draft but so a claim is

399
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
any statement

400
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,880
made by an issuer about an artifact so

401
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,079
that's quite

402
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
generic intentionally so we we want the

403
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,519
issuer to be identifiable and you want

404
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
the same one to be non-reputable so in

405
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
practice it means

406
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
the issuer will design the statement

407
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
with the key associated with their

408
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,399
identity

409
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,199
so

410
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,240
the

411
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
core role of skit is the notary of the

412
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
transparency service

413
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,240
and the role of the military is to

414
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
take

415
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
a claims sign claims that are presented

416
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
to it and then apply its designated

417
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,959
registration policy and if the claim

418
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,440
matches the registration policy to

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,120
register that claim into a transparency

420
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
registry that it maintains and to issue

421
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,839
a receipt that proves that

422
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
this claim has been inserted at a given

423
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,279
position

424
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
in the receipt so the

425
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
getting in more details the registration

426
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
policy

427
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
may really involve checking the identity

428
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
and checking that the

429
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
claim has been correctly signed

430
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,519
and it might also involve access control

431
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,920
and also some optional features like

432
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,120
checking for

433
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
secure version numbers in case you have

434
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,199
multiple claims about the same artifact

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
issued by the same entity

436
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,220
the

437
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,480
[Music]

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,279
the notary once the checks that the

439
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,519
registration policy passes

440
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
adds the claim to this data structure so

441
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
uh the transparency registry so it's a

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,120
very fair data structures that crucially

443
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,920
is happening so the notary can add stuff

444
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
to it but it cannot remove or edit or

445
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
relied what has been recorded in the

446
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,119
past

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
uh i want to point out that transparency

448
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,599
is for the consistency of what's in the

449
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,919
registry it doesn't mean that everyone

450
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,359
will have full access to the registry

451
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,839
that's something that is a matter of

452
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
local implementation decisions for the

453
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,760
notary

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
finally the main notion and the

455
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
cryptographic evidence provided of

456
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
insertion in the lecture is what you

457
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,799
name receipt here so a receipt is online

458
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,440
a universal verifiable proof that a

459
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
claim has been inserted in the registry

460
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
so because the

461
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,880
registry is apparently

462
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
receipts do not expire but of course

463
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
it's possible to happen new entries that

464
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
consume the the older claims and also to

465
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
issue new research

466
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
so once the receipt has been produced

467
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,640
that receipt can be attached to the same

468
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
claim and that what we get is a

469
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
transparent sign claim which is a unit

470
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,960
of

471
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
distribution to verify to relying

472
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
parties verifiers and auditors that can

473
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,919
check that it has been properly assigned

474
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
by the issuer and properly

475
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
counter-signed by the

476
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
the donor that provided the receipt of

477
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
registration

478
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
the next slide please

479
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
okay so here we go with the secrecy

480
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
properties you may ask what we gain by

481
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,880
having this notary intermediary and

482
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
here we have to manage expectations so

483
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
there is no way we can say whether a

484
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
piece of software is good or bad or

485
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
whether something that you claim that is

486
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
made is malicious or in good in good

487
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
faith

488
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,559
the the only thing we propose to do here

489
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,480
is to keep track of what's going on in a

490
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
uniform manner so that everyone gets to

491
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,039
see the same transparent claims

492
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,760
registered onto the ledger and so

493
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
by maintaining this

494
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
shared

495
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
authenticated data structure

496
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,160
which is a transparency

497
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,360
registry

498
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,919
we provide the guarantee that

499
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,799
everyone talks about the same claims

500
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,039
talking about the same artifacts so when

501
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,080
they can refer to it they can endorse it

502
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
maybe they can

503
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
invalidate it like reporter burg or

504
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
vulnerability on it but at least there

505
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
is a common ground for referencing the

506
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,840
claims and the issuers

507
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
quite importantly it also provides a

508
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
strong disincentive for

509
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
reputable actors to issue dubious claims

510
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
because there will be a lagoonable

511
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
foreign that they do and that is made

512
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
transparent in the register

513
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,000
finally and more specifically having

514
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
this

515
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,200
registry guarantee is that it's not

516
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
possible for different relaying parties

517
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
to be

518
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
presented with different claims or

519
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,440
different artifacts

520
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
for the same objects and it's

521
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
very important to exclude classes of

522
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
attacks that would be a target

523
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,200
particular relaying parties as opposed

524
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
to others so trying to

525
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
avoid detection

526
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,559
so there is a price to pay for that and

527
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,840
which is that

528
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
for all consumers or claims like

529
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
verifiers auditor or imparties we accept

530
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
them to check first before they do

531
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,000
anything else with the claim that the

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
claim has been properly registered in

533
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
the designated at the dignity notarian

534
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
for that they will check the counter

535
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,159
signature the proof of inclusion and the

536
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,400
receipt to make sure that they are

537
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,559
talking about something that is properly

538
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
registered before

539
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,080
making any decisions and looking at this

540
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
content and

541
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
deciding

542
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,559
what to do with the artifact

543
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,640
okay next slide

544
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,400
so there is

545
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
quite a lot of related work in this area

546
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
so

547
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
in particular there are many

548
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
transparency mechanisms and services

549
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,679
that have been deployed

550
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,280
typically for

551
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,679
specific use cases or applications so

552
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
the the most famous is probably

553
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
certificate transparency that it tends

554
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,840
to keep a global registry of

555
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,559
all xr99 certificates being used in

556
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,640
practice for a tls authentication

557
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
at least on this on the server side

558
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
there also

559
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,400
a lot of

560
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
interesting work on a software

561
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,640
specifically looking at software build

562
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
of materials or to

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
understand their content their content

564
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
their content or to have what format

565
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
they should be using and also

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
or to systematically register

567
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
any uh software packages of the

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
minorities that get released by uh uh

569
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
trusted entities

570
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,760
um

571
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
finally there is a lot of work on the

572
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
applied cryptographic side on techniques

573
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,919
to issue what we currently receive those

574
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
offline universally verifiable proof of

575
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
inclusion in the register using

576
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
merkel trees or more advanced

577
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
cryptographic constructions

578
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,559
next slide

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
so this is my final slide so it

580
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,080
summarizes the architecture that we have

581
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
so we have

582
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,919
essentially three holes so we have the

583
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
issuer we have the transparency service

584
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,039
or notary for short and then we have

585
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,960
verifiers and auditors

586
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
so the flow goes

587
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,960
as

588
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
a start from the issuer who decides to

589
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,520
make a claim about a given artifact so

590
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
the issuer selects the statements and it

591
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,559
provides

592
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
an envelope that contains headers that

593
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
are going to be interpreted by the

594
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
transparency service and that includes

595
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
its identity its choice of cryptographic

596
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
algorithms and may also include

597
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
additional parameters to be passed to

598
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
the registration policy on first by the

599
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
by the notary

600
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
so the issuer then assigns the

601
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
envelope containing the statement with a

602
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,840
key associated with the identifier the

603
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,200
identifier put in the envelope

604
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
of the claim

605
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
and then

606
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,400
the issuer or anyone else can present

607
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
that claim that sign claim for inclusion

608
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,799
in a transparent data transparency

609
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,080
service so

610
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
the transparency service will apply its

611
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
restriction policy then

612
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
insert in the authenticated data

613
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,039
structure that is the registry then

614
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,159
produce that receipt and return it

615
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,159
so that it can be attached to the claim

616
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
and distributed to any parties who may

617
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
rely about

618
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
that claim and its content

619
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,799
so from that point on the verifier

620
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,559
should of course check that

621
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
whatever claim they accept has been

622
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,919
properly registered so that it is

623
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,120
transparent

624
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
and uh

625
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,559
more more advanced security checks are

626
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
doable for auditors that may be able to

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
collect a large collection of physics

628
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,880
and check for their consistency and

629
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
even go to the registry and replay the

630
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
registration and

631
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,679
of what has been uh put uh what has been

632
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
accepted by the transparency service and

633
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
also independently look at the actual

634
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,200
content of the payload of those

635
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
statements uh to to uh

636
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
to look for example for a defect in the

637
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
software that has been uh

638
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
registered to the system

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
so that's all i have if you have uh

640
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,279
clarifying questions or comments on that

641
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,880
yeah that's six

642
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
that's exactly the point where uh

643
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
michael um

644
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
do you want to put yourself onto the

645
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,559
queue again or

646
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,760
sure

647
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,480
okay are you on the queue no

648
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
um okay go uh do this so here's the spot

649
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
where we

650
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,679
want to talk about clarifying questions

651
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
so uh paul vargas um just just a remark

652
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
on this presentation on the previous

653
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
slide um

654
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
maybe some more slide back

655
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,960
oh yeah no this one

656
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
we did actually in the transparency uh

657
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
working group

658
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,679
also do a little bit of work on this we

659
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,600
tried to do a binary transparency for

660
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
firmware images

661
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,760
work so um i don't think it went very

662
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,360
far and it wasn't really consensus on

663
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,480
doing it

664
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
the way it was described but i just

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
wanted to make sure that

666
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
we're aware of that it has happened and

667
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,960
people might want to just have a quick

668
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
look at it

669
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
yeah paul that's a that's a good comment

670
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,080
and and clearly like for anyone uh who

671
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,159
knows the certificate transparency work

672
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,960
uh

673
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
this is uh obviously very it's

674
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
essentially a generalized version of of

675
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
that but what we are talking about here

676
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,039
so

677
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,400
the problem with above is always um

678
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,840
you have to use some terminology

679
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
and

680
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
while

681
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,640
once the working group in a later stage

682
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
is formed you will actually then agree

683
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
on that terminology so you have to pick

684
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,679
something first and then of course not

685
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,600
everyone agrees so it's it's always a

686
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,799
little bit of chicken and tech problem

687
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,520
but

688
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,039
i hope you

689
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,440
sort of get the basic ideas also with

690
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
the with the help of the diagram

691
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
they had a couple of lots of other

692
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
people in the queue

693
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
but they don't do they want to go to the

694
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
microphone

695
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,279
where's the dick was first echoed you

696
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,120
were next

697
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
but but keep those to the

698
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
but guys keep those to the clarifying

699
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,559
questions because we have a

700
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,760
like 50 minute slot uh afterwards after

701
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
hank's presentation on the program of

702
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
work so

703
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,320
awesome

704
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
thank you cedric my name is dick brooks

705
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
i'm here from reliable energy analytics

706
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
and our company has been in this

707
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
software supply chain risk assessment

708
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,520
area since 2018

709
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,559
and i'm here because you guys have a

710
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,760
very important task ahead of you

711
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
people are relying on digital signatures

712
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
today to prove who the software supplier

713
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,279
is for many of the sign software

714
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,880
products

715
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,120
and the problem is that there's really

716
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,919
no verifiable way to say

717
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
this party was authorized

718
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,919
to sign on behalf of this supplier

719
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,320
and so i did a little experiment to

720
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
prove this to my uh friends in the

721
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,159
energy industry

722
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
i took the java

723
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
one of the java distributions at jvm

724
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
it was signed by oracle

725
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,520
and i went ahead and i signed it with

726
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
rea's signing key

727
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
and when and when i showed the people at

728
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,520
nerc

729
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,679
that i was able to

730
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,720
overcome

731
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,840
take over

732
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
the java distribution and claim that i

733
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,080
was the supplier by virtue of the key

734
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,000
they they were really kind of surprised

735
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
but that's the problem we have right now

736
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,440
that we we need some way from the supply

737
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,640
chain side to have to verify

738
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
these relationships that supplier that

739
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
microsoft you know has authorized dick

740
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,520
brooks or rea to sign on their behalf

741
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
but we need a way to

742
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
verify those relationships and that's

743
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,559
what i think

744
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,600
the opportunity is today

745
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
thank you um yeah try to make sure that

746
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,520
you focus on clarifying questions um

747
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,600
related to the previous uh

748
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,559
text that was presented okay yeah so i'm

749
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
just looking at this and um

750
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,240
uh i guess my question is can you talk

751
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
about the relationship between this work

752
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,360
and sigstor

753
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
so that we can have like a context for

754
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,320
you know

755
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,919
um where the whole ecosystem lives a

756
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,640
little bit uh

757
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,679
so

758
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,600
i wanted to address the previous

759
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,240
question from eric and this one

760
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
close to the microphone i said i wanna i

761
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,679
can address the previous question from

762
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,000
ecker and and this one as well so

763
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,559
my name is roy williams um

764
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,399
in the case of the notary we have an

765
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
opportunity to potentially extend

766
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,039
notarization of claims that last longer

767
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,720
than the certificates that they're

768
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
signed with

769
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
microsoft has done this in the past with

770
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
authenticode and it's been a

771
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
complex problem for us for many years

772
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
and it doesn't scale so we're looking at

773
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
a simpler solution

774
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
the notary concepts here

775
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
allow us to basically say hey the

776
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
trusted routes for the identities of the

777
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,279
people making endorsements or claims can

778
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,720
be configured at the server end and i

779
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,440
don't have to replicate out ca

780
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,080
routes out to a million to a billion

781
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,120
people

782
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
that's an opportunity that comes with

783
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,200
the notary here and potentially a lot of

784
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,039
reduction due to the

785
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,440
what is perceived as a reduced set of

786
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
skid services

787
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,080
um now to eric's last question which is

788
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
six store six store currently the the

789
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,520
open ssf project is multiple so there's

790
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,760
salsa sig store

791
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
um

792
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
jfrog is putting perseus and persia in

793
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
there and so forth in the case of

794
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,799
sigstor

795
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,000
they're currently at the point where

796
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
they're offering a free simple

797
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,840
way

798
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,039
to not have to deal with pki by issuing

799
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,760
certificates at a very short timeline so

800
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
there's no curls or no ocsp

801
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
and you're relying on logging to come

802
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,640
back to proof of

803
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
token

804
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
in this model

805
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,039
sigstor would end up

806
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,399
generating the content that would be

807
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,880
shipped up to a skit instance which the

808
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
notary would then validate and then

809
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
record it when it happened and put it on

810
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
the ledger so they they kind of plug

811
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,039
into one another

812
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,039
in the case of salsa they're making

813
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,799
claims and content

814
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,559
that somebody's going to sign and also

815
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,279
then submit to the skit store so they

816
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,720
they don't overlap they actually

817
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,159
complement each other and plug into one

818
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,120
another

819
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,919
now

820
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,159
who's to say you know as sigstor the

821
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
open source project grows into this

822
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
where there'll be more overlap but at

823
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,960
the moment they just plug into one

824
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,760
another

825
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,799
so

826
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,080
can i add a couple of words um let me

827
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,960
uh if possible like we have a few uh

828
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,840
people still in the cube mikey okay

829
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,679
hi michael richardson

830
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,120
so um

831
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
this is uh

832
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
my problem was with the first slide

833
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
where it said that our use case was

834
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
software uh s-bomb

835
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,640
things we're all really good at that and

836
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
here's a good example of you know the

837
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
things there's several different efforts

838
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
and s bombs and i'm not saying they're

839
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,200
bad or unnecessary i actually think

840
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,480
they're really important and really

841
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
necessary okay

842
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,120
i'm not actually sure what the ietf as a

843
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,279
network uh focused thing brings to uh

844
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,360
those other efforts okay

845
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,960
on in particular my concern is that

846
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,799
um with respect to the people from

847
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,360
microsoft i'm sure you can make anything

848
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
fly

849
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,039
at scale at large scale

850
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,200
the question is you know can you make it

851
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
work for left pad

852
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
right

853
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,080
and that's the real question can you

854
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,559
make it work for physical devices so i

855
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,200
my feedback is

856
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
of course let's deal with the software

857
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,440
bill a materials problem okay but i

858
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,320
think we need a second use case which is

859
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,399
in the physical world

860
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,039
and which explains to people outside the

861
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,360
itf why it is that we're involved in

862
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,679
this process well it's probably because

863
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,440
these claims need to be transmitted over

864
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
the internet and

865
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,039
probably have to have anchors that trust

866
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,039
anchors they are are look up able on the

867
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,159
internet

868
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,120
um with some authorization but to do

869
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,200
that i think we have to go a little bit

870
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
out of our

871
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
comfort zone

872
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
and we're actually going to have we need

873
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
to pick

874
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,640
uh

875
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
a an available

876
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,799
other thing maybe dick here can can

877
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,720
bring us the energy sector

878
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,519
of physical devices in that sector if so

879
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,559
great but but i'm not i don't want us to

880
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
focus on just

881
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,039
you know

882
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,919
left pad and the latest open ssl distro

883
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
we need to go beyond that point

884
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,760
otherwise i think that we'll we'll wind

885
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,440
up with a standard that's great for us

886
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
but nobody else uses

887
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
thank you

888
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,320
yeah

889
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,519
okay um i i yeah i think uh mikey you

890
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,760
indeed support the current approach to

891
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,919
the charter that we have taken uh and

892
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,679
that's actually good we saw that tension

893
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,000
in on the mailing list um some of the

894
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
folks and as i tried to show on this

895
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,960
slide

896
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,519
some folks coming more from the software

897
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,080
supply chain inside others coming from

898
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,799
sort of other industries other verticals

899
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,960
um which is quite understandable because

900
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
hardware and software in

901
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
in the bigger scale of things often

902
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,279
very much relate to each other and and

903
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,120
there's more but uh

904
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
point taken and that's

905
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,200
i i will

906
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,080
i have to cut the cue here to be honest

907
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,600
because otherwise we are not getting to

908
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,240
the actual discussion point uh so

909
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,640
rudiger where are you

910
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
where do you folk i'm not completely

911
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,080
sure if i'm right here

912
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
from my

913
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,399
experience

914
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,679
i'm coming to the question

915
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,519
yes it's really good to have

916
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,799
such

917
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,599
a bill of material and so on

918
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,040
um

919
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,520
what i wonder is

920
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,239
is the question of how to

921
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
bind

922
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,879
the actual deliver the deliverable

923
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
and the

924
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,879
say bill of materials that we are

925
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
talking about

926
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,560
so that one can actually

927
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,399
check as a recipient of the stuff

928
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
that they are actually linked in some

929
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
way

930
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,599
like

931
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,280
in software quite easily

932
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,119
is the intention of having

933
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,918
uh one of the transactions in the bill

934
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,918
saying the last

935
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,239
party dealing with the stuff

936
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,800
uh takes a checksum

937
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,440
and puts in the statement the checksum

938
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,680
of this deliverable is

939
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,839
and well okay that might be

940
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,880
a thing for the physical objects that

941
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,720
were just mentioned

942
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
obviously

943
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,919
that would not directly help

944
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
yes so uh yes so i i think that's a very

945
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,720
interesting point and there's also an

946
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
earlier question about uh authorization

947
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,599
policies and i think that's uh

948
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,320
or to uh outright on or to to know this

949
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
is the this version of the rise to make

950
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,760
those claims

951
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,320
so so i i agree these are a very

952
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
important point the

953
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,880
the approach we are taking here is to

954
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
guarantee that

955
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
we can deliver transparency and claims

956
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,119
as the input of

957
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,160
local authorization policies and so we

958
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,000
we know there is a lot of work on the

959
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,839
authorization policy

960
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,359
before you make the decision whether or

961
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,480
not to accept an artifact as valid and

962
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
we think there is value in providing

963
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
binding from the claims that are the

964
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,240
input of that policy

965
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,280
back to the long-term identity of

966
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
people that are trustworthy because if

967
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,400
they are long-term there can be hardware

968
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
into the policy and the policy can be

969
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,839
checked automatically as opposed to

970
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,640
relies on people to inspect and

971
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,599
be uh

972
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
subject to triples or this kind of thing

973
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
so so yes there is a very big part for

974
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,320
the authorization policy that can be fed

975
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,200
those

976
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
claims after we have checked that they

977
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
are signed and transparent but

978
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,359
we

979
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,280
try to put that out of scope for the

980
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
working group where we just

981
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,720
essentially make sure we can

982
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,200
automatically provide systematically

983
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,480
the guarantee that the claims have been

984
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
validated and registered

985
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,119
without

986
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,720
directly looking at the content which is

987
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
interesting but much more open and

988
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
complicated

989
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,760
um okay and i want to note like please

990
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,599
wear your mask if you don't do it yet

991
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,240
i've seen a couple of people uh

992
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,560
not to worry i have it i don't i know so

993
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,000
i'm sorry to keep pushing on this but i

994
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,079
just didn't understand your answer right

995
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,680
like i looked at six store and they

996
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,280
clearly have a transparency log where

997
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
they plan to and there's already a bt

998
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
vlog at google and so what i'm trying to

999
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
just like what if i understand is are we

1000
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,599
at itf proposing to standardize

1001
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,200
something that will be in competition

1002
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,440
with existing working bt vlogs and if

1003
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
the answer is yes then i'm concerned if

1004
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,480
the answer is no because they're going

1005
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,680
to like pick up whatever this is then

1006
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,599
fantastic so like i'm in favor of this

1007
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,800
area of work but i'm trying to figure

1008
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
out where like are we being asked to

1009
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
spin up competitive work or would you

1010
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,119
have such a collaborative work and it's

1011
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,960
like i'd love to hear from like them

1012
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,079
actually but if i hear from you guys

1013
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,680
i'll start right

1014
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,839
so

1015
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,040
okay

1016
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,520
so this is roy williams uh at the open

1017
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,720
ss mean this basically came up the

1018
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
the people with the most experienced

1019
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
there were cloudflare people that had

1020
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
have done ct logging for the last little

1021
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,839
while

1022
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,000
they did not want to continue down this

1023
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,680
experiment they said this has been super

1024
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
problematic for us and we've been in

1025
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,640
talks with them to see what we could do

1026
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,960
to improve it

1027
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
we're willing to

1028
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,839
to work with them to try and come up

1029
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,520
with a better solution but right now

1030
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
they're saying the ct logging as it

1031
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
exists today that they're offering is

1032
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
not scalable when they they grow up so

1033
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
six door as as what they're attempting

1034
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
to we basically are willing them to work

1035
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,839
with us and we've invited them to the

1036
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
meetings and so forth so yeah there's

1037
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,160
there's a concept of auditing but right

1038
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,480
now the the people that are contributing

1039
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,000
to the the six store open ssf project

1040
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
are saying hey

1041
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,880
they see some roadblocks ahead for what

1042
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,839
they have

1043
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,160
brenton please go ahead

1044
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,560
hi so i i'm in favor of this work i

1045
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,640
think it's it's a really interesting

1046
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
area for us to pursue and i think

1047
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,079
there's some real gains that we can get

1048
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,240
out of it and the the problem that i

1049
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,400
have so far is that i've read through

1050
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,359
the charter and all of it seems to hint

1051
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,000
at some very specific security problems

1052
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
that um that we're trying to fix uh the

1053
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
problem is those aren't written down so

1054
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
i've got a problem statement that has no

1055
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,680
specific threats listed i have no idea

1056
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,040
exactly which threats we're trying to

1057
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,960
mitigate and all of that leads to a lot

1058
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
of confusion in these discussions so

1059
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
what i'm hoping is that somewhere i've

1060
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,520
missed a list of threats i'm hoping that

1061
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,599
you can tell me where to find that so

1062
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
that i can go through this

1063
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,960
if you can look at the draft

1064
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,320
architecture

1065
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,040
that describes

1066
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
the motivation the attacks and some of

1067
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,079
the

1068
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,000
proposed implementation to to actually

1069
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,920
achieve those properties so i think the

1070
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,119
architecture

1071
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,880
of course is just a starting point but

1072
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,760
uh but i think it's uh it's already

1073
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
workable and we also have a prototype

1074
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
implementations that are close to

1075
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
providing those guarantees with what we

1076
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,119
think is a proper security model for

1077
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:49,920
them

1078
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
okay architecture is a is a good

1079
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,280
starting point for that then there are

1080
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,200
some friends on the mailing list as well

1081
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
discussing it

1082
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,119
okay thanks

1083
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,079
elliot

1084
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,400
okay so i just have a quick clarifying

1085
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
point to michael

1086
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,200
um

1087
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,520
who suggests we need a second use case

1088
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,480
um

1089
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,960
yeah that we have a lot of people in in

1090
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
this room who haven't virtually speaking

1091
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,079
impact

1092
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,160
who haven't participated in it when we

1093
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
received guidance

1094
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160
um that we should start that we should

1095
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,119
narrow our use case down to supply chain

1096
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,680
but that was really from you know the

1097
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,200
the

1098
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,359
the ad and others who who said you know

1099
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,520
keep keep it small first

1100
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
so all i'm just gonna say is please

1101
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
let's not penalize the the people who

1102
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,920
are you know designing the who came up

1103
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
with the spec

1104
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,960
um

1105
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,280
for the narrow focus that was really uh

1106
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,000
the ietf own goal if if you have any

1107
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
concerns

1108
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,319
okay um

1109
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,720
thanks elliot

1110
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,920
good um

1111
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,440
so let me move on to the next presenter

1112
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
who

1113
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,400
is that good for you hank

1114
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,000
no

1115
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
see we must be architecture

1116
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
no that's fine okay

1117
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
maybe i

1118
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,640
i'm just confused so um hi this is hank

1119
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
so i'm going to talk about the uh

1120
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,960
essence of this that's which we boil

1121
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,880
down to milestones which of course are

1122
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,160
too abstract and so uh we are going into

1123
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
uh the content that this can be the

1124
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,079
charter at some point and that's

1125
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
why we call the program of work next

1126
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,000
slide please

1127
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,119
so oh i have a monitor here um so yeah

1128
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
brenton said the obvious thing where's

1129
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,680
the threat model

1130
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,640
that's going to be a hard one because we

1131
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
have to first

1132
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,839
understand uh the building that is on

1133
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,079
fire and then now we have to understand

1134
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,240
how to rescue people from the building

1135
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
if it is on fire so uh the third model

1136
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,640
will be part of the architecture and it

1137
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,280
is

1138
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
outlined there a little bit but that is

1139
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,480
a milestone

1140
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,920
so the milestone is the things we are

1141
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
talking about uh terminology-wise i'm

1142
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,040
going to uh go to my standard example

1143
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,599
that i heard somewhere a few years ago

1144
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,760
if you want to buy a house

1145
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,920
uh you probably really have to know

1146
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
who's the buyer

1147
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,800
who's the seller

1148
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
who's the bank

1149
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,000
and who's the notary

1150
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,920
if you confuse these roles

1151
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,400
you pretty much are not buying a house

1152
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,040
and so we are trying to uh secure

1153
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,079
uh supply chain for software here and

1154
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,440
therefore i think in architecture and

1155
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
defining these worlds with precise

1156
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,520
technology is important

1157
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,400
i'm going there later and so information

1158
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,319
models and interaction models are

1159
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,839
important of course because we want to

1160
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,200
have a protocols and this has to

1161
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
interact some signs we have a very

1162
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,760
specific one in cosy right now

1163
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,280
because we want to have this proof that

1164
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,800
this happened

1165
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,240
people were telling about us this

1166
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,280
transaction really happened the

1167
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,920
statement was was made a transparent

1168
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,240
claim you've heard that before and we

1169
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,440
have an ongoing cozy uh independent id

1170
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
um that's talking about these additions

1171
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
to counter signing especially using

1172
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,599
causes so there's something happening

1173
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,880
there you can look at it there's

1174
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,720
something tangible here so these are

1175
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
potential milestones all this is draft

1176
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,119
everything here should be like proposed

1177
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
milestones or proposed after proposed

1178
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,920
architecture because this is above okay

1179
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
i think i hope this is implied so the

1180
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,119
the the proposed way to do a protocol

1181
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,119
here of course is then

1182
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,640
using something

1183
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
like an http based rest api and then

1184
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
request response is just one interaction

1185
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,040
model right you can have a lot of these

1186
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
um but this is very tangible

1187
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,119
everybody i think gets

1188
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,960
request response so these are potential

1189
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,720
milestones that could end up at the

1190
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,280
bottom of a data tracker but now go into

1191
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,760
the details so i spoiled it all now

1192
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
that's that's dissected a little bit

1193
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
um on the following slides we will talk

1194
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
about a server called program of work

1195
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,839
which is i think the frame in which we

1196
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,079
will allow uh deliverables and

1197
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,880
milestones and so um i think that will

1198
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,560
become part of the child at some point

1199
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,920
if we go to chartering and um

1200
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,440
again there's this architectural model

1201
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,280
that was talking about banks and issues

1202
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
and buyers and such these are the actors

1203
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,640
and they somehow interact with each

1204
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,319
other this has to be written down

1205
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,520
somewhere it is not necessary to build a

1206
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,800
system um that functions uh this

1207
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
document here this architecture model

1208
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,319
but if you really want to build it in a

1209
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,920
way that

1210
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,680
does the things that it's intended to do

1211
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,599
and nothing else i think you really need

1212
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,839
the definition of interactions uh

1213
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,680
terminology therefore and interactions

1214
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,839
and brenton's point of view i want to

1215
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,920
add this to the architecture a threat

1216
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,119
model to some extent because that is

1217
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,359
really tied into the information model

1218
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,960
in the action mode in the end and the

1219
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
consister actor identification is key

1220
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,599
i trust a transparency ledger it gives

1221
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,119
me a transparent claim or just the

1222
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,800
receipt of it

1223
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
that's a trust relationship

1224
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,880
i have to identify

1225
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,560
the

1226
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,680
issuer of this contrast signature i have

1227
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,400
to identify the issue of the initial

1228
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,040
statement and that has to be consistent

1229
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
that has to be consistent all over the

1230
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,800
supply chain i think that is an

1231
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,880
essential part of all of this

1232
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
and i'm going into much details because

1233
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,560
this is an overlook over viewers last

1234
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
slide so let's go to the next ones

1235
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,119
because

1236
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,200
i would go deep in here

1237
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,319
yeah

1238
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,200
so

1239
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,319
essentially um the issue is

1240
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,680
key

1241
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,240
the issuer needs a low threshold way to

1242
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,880
make a statement it can't be confusing i

1243
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,280
must be working my app if i take a photo

1244
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,760
and post it to the transparent registry

1245
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,920
it must be really easy

1246
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,079
click done send

1247
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,839
i have key material and such so the

1248
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,160
issuer is of course not always me making

1249
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
a photo so picture didn't happen it's

1250
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,520
not really our scenario here but sorry

1251
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,240
but

1252
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,440
the um

1253
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,960
the important part is that that the

1254
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,680
re-identification

1255
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,119
is a a very hard problem we have pkx we

1256
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,640
have other things in out in the world

1257
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,240
that might last longer than a

1258
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
certificate and the title pkx and i

1259
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,599
heard before on the mic that these

1260
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,680
assertions have to be audible for a long

1261
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,200
long time

1262
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,880
these things will be

1263
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,119
i don't know embedded in a in a highway

1264
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
for a long long time you can't just

1265
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,880
break and auto update them that's done

1266
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
so so i think these audibility features

1267
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,079
are somewhat ingrained in this

1268
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,319
architectural model and therefore it

1269
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,720
will provide a lot of examples how to

1270
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,880
compose these roles and compose these

1271
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,079
actors next slide please

1272
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,920
yeah i was basically ah

1273
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,640
i

1274
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,960
was talking about this lofty slide again

1275
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,440
re-identification of all the parties

1276
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
essential way

1277
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,640
it has to be some decisions on the

1278
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,599
format some decisions on how to manage

1279
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,000
them and some decisions on how people

1280
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,160
are happy with it are you happy with the

1281
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,079
way we are doing this that's working

1282
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,280
group work that's why this slide has no

1283
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
um indication of whatsoever what we want

1284
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,839
to do here with the actual solution

1285
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,000
because it's just consistent actor

1286
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,079
identification that's the problem and

1287
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,599
everybody can agree on this we can have

1288
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,520
rough consensus on this a lot of things

1289
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,680
on the table and i think that is

1290
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
something that is really itf working

1291
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,880
good work because the experts are here

1292
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,200
we can also invite others experts and i

1293
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,400
think

1294
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,640
some of them are already here so i think

1295
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,880
this is a very inspiring slide therefore

1296
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,839
next slide

1297
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,960
we heard about notarization i'm going

1298
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,680
with the second one first um

1299
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,160
it's like a real-life notary

1300
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
it does nothing else

1301
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,520
you go somewhere you conduct some things

1302
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,760
and it's getting notarized by a trusted

1303
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,720
party

1304
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,520
so

1305
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,000
these skit services however we want to

1306
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,839
call them in the end that is transparent

1307
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,160
regency a registry or whatever it's also

1308
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
a logo but a derm term

1309
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,880
these things can scale in any system in

1310
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,720
any instantiation around the globe

1311
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,040
however you want it if you are a global

1312
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,800
manufacturer for software that everybody

1313
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,680
wants to audit be global accessible

1314
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,319
if you are really confidential your

1315
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,000
notary is only accessible for for a few

1316
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,359
select people

1317
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,760
like really select people it's just the

1318
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,119
i don't know run of a certain carrier in

1319
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,240
a certain

1320
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,800
cell phone thingy right it's it can be

1321
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,440
scaled as as much as you want but the

1322
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,599
important part is if suddenly your

1323
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,440
supply chain changes

1324
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
someone else is coming in someone else

1325
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,920
is moving out it has to be interoperable

1326
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,119
and that is why we won't need this

1327
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,520
authentic authenticity layer of that

1328
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,280
really happened because auditing

1329
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,839
otherwise is a nightmare

1330
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,839
i don't know who here is actually an

1331
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,640
auditor and has tried to do a supply

1332
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
chain transition

1333
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,400
from one authority to the other but it

1334
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,640
is a legal and it is a documentation

1335
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,880
nightmare and we can't really solve the

1336
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,160
legal nightmare but we can solve the

1337
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,760
audibility and the accountability

1338
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,520
nightmare a little bit for them and on a

1339
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,440
technical level thank you

1340
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,960
you need to cut it short you'll still

1341
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,800
have two more slides yeah i have one

1342
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,280
minute and 50 seconds go ahead i'm

1343
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,400
having about o'clock there

1344
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,359
so

1345
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,119
i've been already talking about our work

1346
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,640
at cosi and so uh um i'm very uh

1347
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,800
encouraged by the feedback which seems

1348
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,520
to be this is an uh unobjectable content

1349
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,160
to the addition to the cosy realm which

1350
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,920
i'm happy to hear

1351
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,040
um

1352
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,920
again

1353
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,400
we are not inventing new wheels here we

1354
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,720
are literally adding some spikes to the

1355
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,040
wheels so it gets mounted up better so

1356
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,200
so we are using existing iotf technology

1357
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,520
for this contour signing apparently and

1358
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,160
so next step please

1359
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,800
and this is the one i'm i'm i'm not

1360
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,960
absolutely sure about so um some people

1361
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,119
told us it's okay to do apis in the itf

1362
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,000
i was a little bit surprised um so uh

1363
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
yeah we can do some protocol binding

1364
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,440
here because you would have to find

1365
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,280
things in there query response

1366
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,440
apparently uh you'll find one want to

1367
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,839
find the responsible issue of one feed

1368
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,319
of one issue of software and then if the

1369
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,400
authority really changes or if somebody

1370
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
some other entity is endorsing it you

1371
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,480
also find that want to find that

1372
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,960
so i think um a protocol really helps

1373
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,480
here understanding the general

1374
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
operations that you want to support uh

1375
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,400
let's come up with the interactions my

1376
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
slides are gone i have 30 seconds left

1377
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,880
oh okay um but we can take questions now

1378
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
you know you can continue it's just a

1379
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,040
lost internet connectivity oh oh that's

1380
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,760
it's not me it's you okay um that's

1381
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,800
that's unusual

1382
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,119
it's not a sabotage thing

1383
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,040
sure

1384
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,400
let's start at the beginning also we're

1385
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,880
doing skill

1386
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,920
then okay um so um i mean i think really

1387
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
we are we are coming from the ietf point

1388
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,480
of view having a reference protocol

1389
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,000
helps

1390
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,760
helps understanding what the operations

1391
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,880
are again

1392
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,640
binds it all together information model

1393
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,800
interaction model architectural roles a

1394
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,960
reference protocol would really help you

1395
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,640
i think and then also doesn't hurt if

1396
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,720
you're starting from zero it's fine to

1397
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,760
have one

1398
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,839
uh if you're already involved heavily in

1399
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,200
your own thing

1400
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,520
get our cool building blocks because we

1401
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,920
are not providing systems and so yeah

1402
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
that's basically my comment on the

1403
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,160
portal bindings and i'm perfect on time

1404
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,520
excellent um thank you hank um

1405
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,920
so i could i will yield the mic for the

1406
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,680
discussion but it will come back to any

1407
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,680
of these mics for discussion so don't

1408
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,520
don't think that i'm leaving the room or

1409
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,720
something

1410
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,400
for so in in short for items um

1411
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,160
to be worked on four documents specific

1412
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,800
documents nothing that should probably

1413
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
surprise you having worked in the idf

1414
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,559
before

1415
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,800
um

1416
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,359
discussion time

1417
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:16,680
uh i see the first person uh nalini

1418
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,240
maybe this is not the right time for

1419
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,920
this i'm just trying to put this into

1420
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,119
context

1421
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,839
so so i'm not clear how you become a

1422
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,440
notary and and whether this also applies

1423
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,480
to

1424
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,920
open source

1425
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,160
software as well as

1426
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,599
you know something produced by a

1427
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,160
for-profit company all right if you

1428
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
don't know if you can get to that or or

1429
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,480
what

1430
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,880
that's the microphone

1431
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,280
so this is hank um

1432
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,880
the basis for this is that we have a

1433
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
code base we have a apparently signing

1434
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,440
is involved right so the code base we're

1435
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,400
doing here uh is um as a reference where

1436
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,559
we are starting with this is cozy

1437
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
and all of this is going to be not very

1438
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,079
open source but also very code reviewed

1439
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,440
and this does not stop with the uh

1440
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,400
single

1441
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
libraries that it goes on with

1442
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,640
interoperability between libraries and

1443
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,280
and and on the matrix automatics that uh

1444
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,720
that shows you which library is

1445
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,960
interoperable with which in your supply

1446
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,040
chain so we can recommend something here

1447
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,359
that we there's a hard basis for for

1448
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,559
decision actually and then a reference

1449
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,040
notary is planned as a open source

1450
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,680
project also so so you can't just go

1451
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,480
with

1452
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,520
just do this uh yes a open source and

1453
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,760
and free available and an easy

1454
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,480
licensable framework is is is on the

1455
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,960
roadmap and very very close and we can

1456
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,599
if we look at the um

1457
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,240
i think it's arms go cozy

1458
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,040
um you can see how how uh how we really

1459
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,319
mean this because there are there's a

1460
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,559
report folder in there that includes two

1461
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,119
code reviews and and that's the basis we

1462
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,839
basically achieved as aspire to

1463
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,440
um to be really reliable on the uh

1464
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,400
um ground the grassroot code here

1465
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,680
cedric uh yes i have a complimentary uh

1466
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,800
uh

1467
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,920
answer to this question so the

1468
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,520
something i fail to mention in the

1469
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,440
architecture is that we do not presume

1470
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,559
there will be a centralized notary for

1471
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,000
everyone and so

1472
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,119
quite crucially you want to have

1473
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,040
interoperability and so it's completely

1474
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,440
alright to have multiple notaries

1475
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,839
multiple services that are trusted by

1476
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,920
different people for different reasons

1477
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,160
so now the more it is open source and

1478
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,920
the more there is reference rotations

1479
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
and the more guarantees you can provide

1480
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,480
such as running with uh they'll get

1481
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,640
replications or with additional

1482
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,040
independent auditing or with trusted

1483
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
hardware the more transparency will be

1484
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,319
on the more likely it will be crazy

1485
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,079
member people but we don't want to

1486
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,000
prescribe that so we hope there will be

1487
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,319
a healthy diversity of

1488
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,240
military services for different purposes

1489
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,720
and in fact for some of the use cases it

1490
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,119
makes sense to have a dedicated service

1491
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,160
like uh if you look at uh the

1492
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,319
uh the use cases that are we described

1493
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,599
last time there is confidential

1494
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,319
computing and for that in order to be

1495
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,680
able to say good things about the

1496
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,920
binaries that we trust for attestation

1497
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,599
having a dedicated

1498
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,920
notary service makes a lot of sense

1499
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,200
similarly the same claims can be

1500
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,040
registered on multiple

1501
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,359
notaries for different purposes and

1502
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,799
that's also

1503
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,640
something that we think should naturally

1504
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,680
occur with

1505
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,078
multiple notaries

1506
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,440
regarding the scope uh i'd like you know

1507
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,200
i see a lot of parallels going even

1508
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,880
further down the stack than just

1509
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,440
software the software runs on a machine

1510
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,839
you've got firmware you've got hardware

1511
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,880
and i see this applicable not just just

1512
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
the software supply chain

1513
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,960
but also the hardware and firmware

1514
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
supply chain

1515
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,480
so i think i would like to see

1516
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,760
i mean i think this is a great solution

1517
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,520
for that we've got platform certificates

1518
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,720
out there people producing

1519
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,799
basically certificates that said that

1520
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,000
machine came from xyz manufacturer we

1521
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,200
don't have a way to distribute them

1522
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,400
right now i think this is a phenomenal

1523
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,359
way to get that as well as reference

1524
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,200
measurements for firmware and things

1525
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,480
like that firmware is really just

1526
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,599
software

1527
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,440
and the platform itself kind of

1528
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,680
emphasizing this is also comprised of

1529
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,040
many components

1530
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,880
inside each one of your machines you

1531
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,000
probably have a half dozen

1532
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,160
microcontrollers all of them have

1533
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,359
firmware that's updatable

1534
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
so i i guess i would

1535
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,079
i could see this this the the scope of

1536
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,640
this expanding to further down the stack

1537
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,319
as well i don't see anything different

1538
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,000
that i would do

1539
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,040
one uh a question back um

1540
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,200
if you look at the current charter text

1541
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,319
do you see

1542
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,079
like it has

1543
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,720
been written in a slightly more generic

1544
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,559
way do you think that charger would

1545
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,599
cover

1546
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,280
sort of like the

1547
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,200
the space the use cases that you have in

1548
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
mind like with software firmware

1549
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,920
hardware

1550
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,119
um

1551
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,280
i think the literal wording right now

1552
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,640
someone would

1553
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,319
say hardware

1554
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,920
you know shipping a safe platform

1555
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,839
certificate describing the hardware

1556
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,920
might be out of scope

1557
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,079
so i i don't think it requires a lot of

1558
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,880
tweaks okay but

1559
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
again we as a group need to decide is

1560
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,280
that in scope is is it simply the

1561
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,799
software that's running

1562
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,960
the operating system above or does it

1563
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,520
also include the stuff below if it's not

1564
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,200
then i think we need to start up another

1565
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,559
group for that

1566
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,160
i'd like to see it all in one because i

1567
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,839
don't see the problem statement being a

1568
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,720
lot different between the two okay so

1569
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,879
yeah

1570
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,839
can i get a comment in there i think the

1571
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,640
important part uh the the the working

1572
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,599
group is

1573
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,760
or the proposed working group here

1574
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,319
is intended to use software transparency

1575
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,160
as a first use case

1576
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,040
it's not intended to be

1577
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,799
circumscribed to just software's

1578
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,680
transparency though and so maybe the

1579
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,960
thing we need to do is monty is as as

1580
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,880
we're going through the work

1581
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,720
of the working group assuming that it

1582
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,839
gets charted a charter that you should

1583
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,240
probably have us that that that hardware

1584
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,760
use case

1585
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,920
at least in your hip pocket and maybe we

1586
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,160
should talk with the area directors and

1587
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,480
say well maybe we do adopt it as a draft

1588
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,280
if it's if it's available but the risk

1589
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,599
of that and this is where

1590
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,559
i think

1591
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,640
roman might want to comment

1592
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,720
is that people become unfocused if you

1593
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,760
have if you diverge too far

1594
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,520
so there's a bit of a tension there and

1595
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,680
i just want to highlight

1596
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,760
uh that that you know we don't i don't

1597
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,119
think we want to be too narrow but at

1598
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,599
the same time you know we don't want to

1599
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,440
be so general that we're not useful for

1600
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,720
anything

1601
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,799
yeah yeah so i agree there's going to be

1602
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:11,599
some

1603
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:12,880
some balance you don't want to lose

1604
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,119
focus you have a really good thing to do

1605
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,160
here

1606
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,920
but at the same time i don't i don't

1607
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,240
want to reinvent the wheel over in

1608
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,480
another working group right so you know

1609
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,079
if we can make it general enough that

1610
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,839
would be great then we could just tweak

1611
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:26,880
it a little bit

1612
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,480
but i'll be more than happy to

1613
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,680
participate

1614
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,480
in writing use cases and and and helping

1615
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,160
with the charter if we need to work work

1616
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,839
with that charter more than happy to

1617
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,319
help with that

1618
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,240
thanks thanks monty and ellie you since

1619
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,599
you invoked i was going to comment

1620
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,599
that's what hannis and i uh we're

1621
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,200
talking about here up front i think what

1622
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,040
you're observing is the big lesson

1623
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,920
learned from the first buff which was

1624
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,799
there

1625
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,359
there was appreciation around uh the use

1626
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,359
case of kind of software but as we saw a

1627
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,599
number of other entities said but wait

1628
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,680
this in fact may generalize and i

1629
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,119
believe that the finesse that occurred

1630
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,880
on the mailing list after was those

1631
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,119
changes to the charter which say we are

1632
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,599
absolutely going to cover software

1633
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
but we're writing this in such a generic

1634
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,599
way that this is probably going to be

1635
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,559
going to be

1636
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,079
going to be reasonable for a lot of

1637
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,680
other applications we did not know what

1638
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,680
the answer was for all of the next use

1639
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,440
cases and so that perhaps is some of the

1640
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,119
conversation to have here but as the

1641
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,319
charter is currently scoped it's

1642
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,599
software but things are written

1643
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,359
generically so that is kind of a bit of

1644
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,799
the squint at the chart early do you

1645
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,160
think it precludes things and let's have

1646
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,040
a conversation about it

1647
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,559
thanks um

1648
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,599
uh philip yeah uh just responding to

1649
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,480
that i think it's a terrible idea and

1650
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
here's why

1651
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,400
software is completely different to

1652
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,760
everything else

1653
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,839
because you've got a massive amount of

1654
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,680
installed base

1655
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,200
and if you want to do anything that

1656
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,319
makes any sense to software provenance

1657
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,480
you have git

1658
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,079
and you have software signing

1659
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,079
and anything that you do

1660
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,480
has to bridge between the two if it's

1661
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,720
going to be of any use

1662
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,599
now my model of doing this

1663
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,640
every user is a notary

1664
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,520
all you have to do is to modify git

1665
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,000
slightly so that instead of just putting

1666
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,880
a pgp signature in

1667
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,839
you have create a signature that is

1668
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,559
enrolled and interlocked to the

1669
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,640
individual developers

1670
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,720
personal notary chain

1671
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,359
and then that notary uh

1672
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,119
interlocks with every other through a

1673
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,359
bridge eventually

1674
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,079
and so every user ends up being their

1675
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,000
own route of trust when they're

1676
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,960
evaluating notary claims

1677
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,640
so the notary doesn't need to be a

1678
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,319
trusted party

1679
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,400
in this system you can factor out that

1680
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,599
trust

1681
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,280
you can't do that if you're talking

1682
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,839
about supply of baked beans you can do

1683
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,680
it for software

1684
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,760
and then when we look at the

1685
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
how do you go to

1686
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,839
code signing

1687
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,599
at the moment we have a really bad model

1688
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,520
for code signing well

1689
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
every vendor seems to want to do it

1690
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,760
their own way

1691
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,240
and we sign software distribution

1692
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,440
packages

1693
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,160
not the code that runs on the machine

1694
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,280
and we only do the uh final code not

1695
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,480
every

1696
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,079
individual

1697
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,000
my point here is that if you want to do

1698
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,520
something useful

1699
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,240
in software supply chain

1700
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,799
it is a thing of itself

1701
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,880
that has unique advantages that you

1702
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,920
cannot apply to supply of baked beans

1703
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,160
routers or anything else

1704
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,799
it's got to be considered separately and

1705
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,880
you've got to interface with all that

1706
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,319
existing legacy infrastructure or it'll

1707
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,559
be irrelevant

1708
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,200
uh thanks philip um in response to that

1709
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,240
i feel i think what what i hear is you

1710
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,440
agree that there's a problem and you you

1711
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,960
you just uh phillips shaking his head uh

1712
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,359
but not in his head sorry um

1713
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,599
and i think where the

1714
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,440
difference uh lies is more in

1715
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,160
in the solution space uh of course we

1716
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,319
will have hopefully plenty of time to

1717
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,000
discuss different solution spaces i'm

1718
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,720
sure uh some of you have other ideas on

1719
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,799
how to do that and love to hear more

1720
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,520
about that but i think it it um

1721
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,760
sort of like we are not there yet to

1722
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,920
really dig into the the solutions at

1723
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,559
least um i'm not at this point um but

1724
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,480
it's it's definitely something that we

1725
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,160
should um talk about in the future

1726
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,079
and the other point on where the

1727
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,400
software is very different from hardware

1728
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,880
point taken um

1729
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,160
and and it's

1730
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,839
like others obviously

1731
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,880
like monty who just spoke um

1732
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,720
right before you in the queue thinks

1733
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,559
differently so we'll have to have to

1734
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,480
hash this out as we look into

1735
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,440
specific use cases which is also

1736
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,599
part of the architecture in terminology

1737
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,359
document i think

1738
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,960
we need to look into this see what is

1739
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,119
commonalities where the differences are

1740
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,520
and then figure this out and if there's

1741
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
let's assume there's no

1742
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,280
relationship between any of those then

1743
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,119
we have a solution for software

1744
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,440
it's yeah it's for the community to

1745
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,079
decide as roman says uh correctly okay

1746
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,079
nalini and the queue gets longer oh my

1747
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,799
god okay

1748
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,359
first this is a it's a it's an inquiry

1749
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,000
it's a very very important problem

1750
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,720
and and definitely as a software vendor

1751
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,559
i'm very very interested

1752
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,039
but so but but a couple of clarifying

1753
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,559
things is like

1754
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,799
like like the question of who is a

1755
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,319
notary and how do i say who a notary is

1756
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,240
is very important it's like certificate

1757
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,119
authorities can no can i just say i am

1758
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,480
now a notary

1759
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,039
and i will sign everything i will attest

1760
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,880
i mean is that can i do that and then

1761
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,119
like now like cas are like you have to

1762
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,280
like you know like cas are defined in

1763
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,839
the os and and stuff like that and java

1764
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,680
store i mean there's a bunch of like a

1765
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,400
bunch of details around that like how is

1766
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,079
that and i don't know i is that within

1767
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,480
the scope of the work so

1768
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,359
and and if i may try to respond to that

1769
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,160
um

1770
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,240
in general

1771
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,559
like we would work on the protocols and

1772
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,920
the mechanisms that require

1773
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,559
intra-mobility so if some environment

1774
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,640
says like everyone can do their role

1775
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,119
their own like you could be your own ca

1776
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,640
like as i do for testing at the

1777
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,280
hackathon i am i'm literally setting up

1778
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,359
my own say of course

1779
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,920
um you could do that too um

1780
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,160
whether that would be then in a specific

1781
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,079
use case uh

1782
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,079
then be acceptable to the other parties

1783
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,359
i think that's a deployment

1784
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,200
consideration that of course

1785
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,920
architecture document may explore but i

1786
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,240
think it's from an intro ability point

1787
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,000
of view it's less of an issue

1788
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:02,400
okay so but i mean at some point someone

1789
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,480
needs to think about that

1790
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,280
sure yeah i definitely agree yeah and

1791
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,839
and another thing is that i'm gonna i'll

1792
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,240
stop talking is um

1793
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,400
so like okay for example like we have

1794
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,240
software that uses tomcat and then does

1795
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,839
commands maybe to the to the linux os so

1796
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:26,400
within our software do we need signed

1797
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,839
whatever it is

1798
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,680
for all these other things and who

1799
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,480
exactly is signing them is it linux

1800
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,119
foundation signing on behalf of linux or

1801
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,319
what

1802
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,839
so

1803
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:41,039
um that's a good question uh

1804
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,359
in

1805
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
so there's pride there's other work that

1806
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,000
we uh we definitely go are going to

1807
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,839
reuse here this is the whole debate

1808
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,760
about software bill of material in case

1809
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,240
of the software where there's obviously

1810
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,960
lots of work on on figuring out on who

1811
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,119
signs what um how does this work how do

1812
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,799
the formats look like so we would

1813
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,960
essentially stand on the shoulders of

1814
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,440
giant here who have done years of work

1815
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,000
on that space already so we would reuse

1816
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,680
that like we as hank said we reuse

1817
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,119
other idf work okay

1818
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,920
brenton i i

1819
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,680
have to get to the queue okay

1820
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,760
okay there um

1821
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,240
i'm i'm sorry to bang on about this

1822
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,760
again with threat models and um and to

1823
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,119
and i'm gonna about to say some things

1824
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,400
that sound like i don't support this

1825
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,079
work but i promise i do support this

1826
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,760
work i just think that we need to be

1827
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,920
very specific about what we're doing and

1828
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,400
i'm worried that right now we're not um

1829
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,880
so i'll give you a couple of examples so

1830
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,039
if we take that original example uh that

1831
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,960
someone brought up a little while ago

1832
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,760
about uh taking a key that's trusted by

1833
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,559
the os for one application and using it

1834
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,520
to sign another um i'd like to know how

1835
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,559
we see this solving that problem i mean

1836
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,480
there's an obvious way that we could

1837
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,240
look at it and that means you know when

1838
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,160
you go to install a piece of software

1839
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,160
you have to you know trace that

1840
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,039
particular software's signer back

1841
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,079
through the log and see if it changed

1842
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,198
um and then then you can maybe make some

1843
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,279
decision but the question is do you

1844
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,120
really need that or can you just look at

1845
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,719
what the trust anchor for the previous

1846
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,679
key was you know that you've you can do

1847
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,520
the same thing based on your own history

1848
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,679
then the only gain we get here is for

1849
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,439
brand new installations

1850
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,479
um

1851
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,198
so is that a goal of yeah is that what

1852
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,560
we're trying to solve

1853
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,439
uh the second example is that you know

1854
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,120
take solar winds for example someone

1855
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,040
breaks into a build server

1856
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,319
and they legitimately sign a piece of

1857
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,799
broken code this is you know a

1858
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,880
deliberate attack and they use the

1859
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,960
existing signing infrastructure to do it

1860
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,759
so

1861
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,759
now i have to go back again and say

1862
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,520
we've got supply chain

1863
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,439
we've got a software bill of materials

1864
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,839
we've got signatures we've got notaries

1865
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,238
how does it save us from this attack

1866
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,719
i i don't understand where this all fits

1867
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,198
in and i i just like this is why i'm

1868
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,439
talking about threats and threat models

1869
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,600
i want to see how all these pieces fit

1870
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,399
together so that i can understand how

1871
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,560
we're solving this problem because i'm

1872
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,319
lost right now i don't i don't quite get

1873
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,400
it

1874
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,920
brenton i

1875
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,198
i hear you a little bit that you would

1876
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,880
like to see almost like a separate

1877
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,799
threat model document in addition to

1878
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,040
what's what would otherwise go into an

1879
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,000
architecture to cover this thoroughly

1880
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,080
i think that honestly i think it's

1881
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,679
necessary because

1882
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,679
right now what i see

1883
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,238
is a bunch of security requirements with

1884
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,719
no justification and their advantages

1885
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,600
simply implied

1886
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,280
is it okay if i answer the part two of

1887
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,800
the question which brandon has asked

1888
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,040
actually there's a long queue you can uh

1889
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,560
which i closed already so you're a

1890
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,040
little late on that uh

1891
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,600
sorry about that i need to answer not

1892
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,600
questions if there's time uh will um

1893
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,840
yeah but uh yeah

1894
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,719
maybe we'll get to that uh chris

1895
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,440
hi uh christopher i i feel like there's

1896
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,520
a disconnect for

1897
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,199
some of the statements and i'd like some

1898
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,360
refinements

1899
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,800
there's a disconnect from some of the

1900
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,480
statements i'd like some refinement in

1901
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,120
the charter about like identities

1902
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,280
so it's kind of described as being out

1903
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,320
of scope

1904
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,520
but then

1905
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,400
you know

1906
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,239
cedric kind of mentioned that identities

1907
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,880
need to have endurance and long-lasting

1908
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,560
and so you can't just you know kind of

1909
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,159
issue a new identity and issue a new

1910
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,480
identity and issue a new identity

1911
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,640
and there's no way to kind of manage or

1912
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,400
control that in the protocol and it

1913
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,400
seems like a key foundation to it so if

1914
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,440
there could be

1915
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,080
text added around what i think is kind

1916
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,560
of a big problem in

1917
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,400
what's there so far that would help me

1918
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,560
out a lot because otherwise i don't feel

1919
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,080
like we can make the assertions we want

1920
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,159
to make

1921
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,960
i'm just going to actually clear that um

1922
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,920
maybe if

1923
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,000
if you could propose some text

1924
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
uh that would that might help on maybe

1925
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,080
on list or that would that would be

1926
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,080
appreciated

1927
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,760
okay

1928
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,360
so

1929
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,880
all right so it seems to me that

1930
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,960
software is different from real world

1931
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,239
artifacts in the software you want to be

1932
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,280
immutable

1933
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,920
you don't want it changed whereas if i

1934
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,800
buy myself my kid a gaming pc and he

1935
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,120
wants to upgrade his

1936
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,280
video card and then maybe sell the old

1937
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,199
one to somebody else

1938
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,760
how do you handle that um the other

1939
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,360
thing is i want to know on the software

1940
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,239
side

1941
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,640
how do i know if a bag of bits

1942
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,159
is software

1943
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,440
or

1944
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,960
a gif of a board ape

1945
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,679
and does this enable

1946
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,719
that whole bad thing

1947
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,480
so i'm concerned that this is

1948
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,800
you know we're trying to boil the ocean

1949
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,280
and merge too many separate things here

1950
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,280
and that instead we're going to end up

1951
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,280
with

1952
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,440
you know nfts is the only thing that

1953
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,679
really works

1954
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:32,880
so um

1955
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,159
i think it needs another i think it

1956
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,520
needs more clarification and more

1957
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,679
refinement i think the generalization is

1958
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,440
a really bad idea

1959
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,880
you can't argue with me hank that's my

1960
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,280
opinion

1961
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,000
yeah yeah yeah i guess uh dick uh you're

1962
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,640
not you are in the queue um uh but in

1963
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,400
response to that

1964
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,880
i think we've heard on the mailing list

1965
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,199
and now here that some people are

1966
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,560
pro

1967
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,000
more than the software use case and

1968
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,920
others are focused on the software use

1969
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,840
case and we will have a

1970
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,880
um

1971
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,800
later on to figure out like where you

1972
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,120
guys are with regards to that question

1973
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,239
in general

1974
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,719
and then we just then we do what uh you

1975
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,480
guys want

1976
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,679
dick go ahead

1977
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,800
yeah dick brooks you know right now

1978
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,159
software consumers have no trustworthy

1979
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,719
way to verify

1980
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,960
the software supply chain

1981
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,880
they can't verify even the most simple

1982
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,360
things like this software signature on

1983
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,960
this software package is legitimate

1984
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,640
there's a need

1985
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,400
and someone's going to have to solve

1986
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,360
this

1987
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,520
it doesn't exist today to have this

1988
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
verification function

1989
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,199
so that a consumer

1990
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,239
can go out and check that information

1991
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,520
and establish some level of

1992
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,280
trustworthiness

1993
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,560
and i think

1994
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,760
i think

1995
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,000
we will have succeeded

1996
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,040
if we can get some greater visibility

1997
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,040
into these

1998
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,159
smart grid app stores which collectively

1999
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,000
are the largest distribution point to

2000
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,760
software on the planet commercial

2001
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,600
software

2002
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,920
if we can get visibility for these

2003
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,320
consumers to be able to compare trust

2004
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,280
scores or compare something about trust

2005
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,719
we will have given

2006
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,960
the the community something useful

2007
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,040
thank you

2008
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,440
cedric

2009
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,120
i would like to make a couple of

2010
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,440
reclarification is it okay or should i

2011
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,159
leave home for questions

2012
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,239
so the first one has to do with um so

2013
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,280
there were a couple of questions

2014
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,040
suggesting that the

2015
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,520
notary would be a central authority and

2016
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,120
that

2017
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,440
deciding who gets to be the notary is

2018
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,800
super important he's controlled to

2019
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,480
architecture

2020
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,840
and and similarly with the question of

2021
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,440
software like everyone should be there

2022
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,800
on notary if they want to sign their

2023
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,920
software

2024
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,960
uh

2025
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,800
i would like to emphasize that the

2026
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,280
notary the issues the counter signatures

2027
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,199
that that's not the primary asceron clan

2028
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,000
so

2029
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,840
the whole architecture suppose is that

2030
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,960
issuers

2031
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,520
typically software providers developers

2032
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,280
will sign their artifacts and that's a

2033
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,760
primary signature and there will be a

2034
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,320
held accountable for that what the

2035
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,760
notary provides is more like an

2036
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,600
administrative function we are not going

2037
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
to accuse the notary of taking over the

2038
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,719
world they just

2039
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,560
take the claims look check that they

2040
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,239
look again superficially then put that

2041
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,080
into the registry and that's it so

2042
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,080
that's not a source of authority like a

2043
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,280
ca the

2044
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,320
the notary has no way of issuing uh uh

2045
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,920
signed claims on behalf of anyone else

2046
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,679
in the system

2047
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,520
uh regarding i don't it's you i don't

2048
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,640
think you have time to get in the

2049
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,159
details but there is an interesting

2050
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,320
thread on the mailing list discussing

2051
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
why your water approaches and some

2052
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,040
alternatives to it

2053
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,280
thanks

2054
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,520
i i open up the

2055
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,280
queue again which i previously closed

2056
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,960
and worried that we wouldn't get through

2057
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,840
it in time so hank yogesh and i think

2058
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,400
cullen uh also wants to get up there so

2059
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,280
please please do

2060
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,480
okay

2061
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,440
uh

2062
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,519
wait are you in a room or remote

2063
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,159
uh first of all i need to say i uh in

2064
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,480
favor of this work but my concern is

2065
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,600
that this work may be

2066
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,800
to

2067
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,840
rely upon the supply chain or

2068
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,280
i suggest recommend

2069
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,840
using the word supply chain as less as

2070
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,800
possible because actually i feel this

2071
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,080
work

2072
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,400
shouldn't be bound to the supply chain

2073
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,719
for example the supply chain the word

2074
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,640
supply chain appears 30 uh 23 times in

2075
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,920
the chatter but it only appears uh 21

2076
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,080
times in the architecture draft which is

2077
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,760
our 26

2078
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,120
page draft so

2079
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,400
so i think it's not really so

2080
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:12,700
um

2081
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,080
[Music]

2082
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,360
related to

2083
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,040
or so

2084
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,640
rely upon the

2085
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,920
supply chain

2086
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,000
um besides that i feel um this is um

2087
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,159
solution is just like

2088
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,000
a transparent

2089
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,159
statement tracking or

2090
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,120
service so

2091
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,320
it's not appropriate to put the supply

2092
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,520
chain in the working group name

2093
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,440
for example we don't

2094
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,120
we don't put

2095
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,280
supply chain in the rats working group

2096
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,480
names but uh the rats remote attestation

2097
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,440
could be used to secure uh the supply

2098
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,440
chain in in certain ways

2099
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:00,400
um yeah and uh in the chatter i saw um

2100
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,199
in the goals it says to standardize the

2101
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,400
overall security flows for securing uh

2102
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,320
the supply chain but

2103
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
i think securing the supply chain

2104
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,440
involves a lot of non-technical points

2105
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,920
so uh saying this may be

2106
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,520
too broad for the working group

2107
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,520
that's all thank you

2108
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,600
thank you thanks ray um i hear you

2109
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,560
making a couple of points here um

2110
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,159
the i think

2111
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,159
it would help the group if you could

2112
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,800
propose some text on that on the charter

2113
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,080
um to

2114
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,000
use maybe terms or also for the

2115
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,719
architecture document to use terms um

2116
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,640
that you think are more appropriate in

2117
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,040
in places where supply chain is maybe

2118
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,880
used too often i think that would be

2119
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,000
helpful

2120
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,080
also the working group name itself is

2121
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,400
something that is of course up for

2122
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,000
the group and for

2123
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,199
uh the isg and uh and so on and so on to

2124
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,560
make so um

2125
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,800
yeah we are with i think

2126
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,120
totally up for that so so

2127
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,159
thanks thank you for the feedback

2128
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,199
roy

2129
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,640
rory williams

2130
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,400
so i wanted to make a few comments so

2131
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,840
there's been a lot of discussion on the

2132
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,600
difference between the software and the

2133
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,800
hardware

2134
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,040
use cases and some of the other ones

2135
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,440
there are probably a half a dozen to a

2136
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,679
dozen that we know of of use cases that

2137
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,120
we could walk through

2138
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,360
but we were really focusing on hey let's

2139
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,080
just see we can do a generic one to fill

2140
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,199
in some basic building blocks we have

2141
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,679
in general for this whole problem space

2142
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,679
some of the questions on how do i set

2143
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,600
myself with a notary

2144
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,520
but what we're trying to define here is

2145
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,280
an interface for implementers to

2146
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,800
implement and whether there's an

2147
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,040
instance you can install on your in your

2148
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,239
own network

2149
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,840
or there's a government one or there's

2150
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,159
an industry one those are outside the

2151
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,320
reach of this

2152
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,840
as to whether big companies like

2153
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,239
microsoft or google will stand up on

2154
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,360
that's still

2155
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,280
too far in the future

2156
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,159
the

2157
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,560
discussions on how to supply a secure

2158
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,600
software

2159
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,920
and all the discussions in s-bombs we

2160
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,360
kind of take out of the here because

2161
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,560
there's already

2162
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,840
um other groups working on some of the

2163
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,239
issues to deal with the requests from

2164
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,760
the us government

2165
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,159
around s-bombs in microsoft's case we're

2166
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,480
signing our our s-bombs and putting

2167
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,639
hashes of functions and and talking

2168
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,199
about binding keys that's not

2169
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,960
what this working group is about this is

2170
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,199
about building blocks we kind of need

2171
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,440
transmit those things around

2172
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,520
when we talk about signatures of

2173
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,480
software

2174
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,639
microsoft signs every single binary we

2175
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:35,760
produce

2176
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,840
but we don't sign the text files and

2177
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,239
those signatures

2178
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,400
readily expire well before the product

2179
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,719
life cycle ever exits and that's why we

2180
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,480
were hoping for something like the

2181
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,480
notary to

2182
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,960
to transition that case

2183
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,320
if you want to see how microsoft does

2184
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,639
its day you can read through the athena

2185
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,040
code specific specification

2186
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,120
and you can tell we're not very happy

2187
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,639
with where the some of the directions

2188
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,120
gone in there

2189
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,960
thanks uh thomas

2190
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,120
yeah i'll wear my mit hat on so i just

2191
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,400
want to say i'm very closer to the

2192
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,320
microphone i'm very much in favor of

2193
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,679
this two years ago i pitched a bunch of

2194
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,480
presentations to the tcg

2195
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,920
and this is two years ago the slides are

2196
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,840
still up in the tcga website for those

2197
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,760
uh have access to it

2198
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,920
and i kind of didn't get a listening

2199
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,880
because

2200
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,600
of

2201
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,520
many reasons and that one one being the

2202
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,360
lack of i guess software providers in

2203
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,800
the tcg so it's great to see iitf do

2204
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,679
this

2205
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,840
related to this i was involved i've been

2206
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,440
following a thing called gsa ties for

2207
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,560
those who know what the global

2208
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,920
semiconductor alliances they're

2209
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,360
doing that well they're talking about

2210
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,159
the same thing niche it would be good if

2211
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,360
they would be

2212
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,600
made aware of this work because they'll

2213
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,199
probably just use it

2214
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,280
so that's another sort of audience that

2215
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,760
this group could um could talk to

2216
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,679
using a different hat so on tuesday

2217
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,920
there was a small company that was

2218
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,840
called 14 bis

2219
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,480
that is doing supply chain for aircraft

2220
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,120
components the ceo just texted me to say

2221
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,320
look could you say that they're in

2222
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,679
support also

2223
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,120
and if this becomes a working group

2224
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,719
they'll come and join

2225
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,440
awesome thanks that's great to hear

2226
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,600
colin

2227
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,080
calling jigs so i'm trying to work

2228
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,920
through like hey

2229
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,960
i mean i believe we could build

2230
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,880
something like this it has really a lot

2231
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,719
every single stage of it is about as

2232
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,639
distributed and complicated as possible

2233
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,239
it's a very complicated solution to this

2234
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,440
type of problem

2235
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,719
but the thing that i'm trying to get my

2236
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,320
head around is

2237
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,639
it seems like there's a lot of different

2238
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,320
players that need to deploy something

2239
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
for this to deploy in the real world

2240
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,239
and it's not obvious to me what the

2241
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,239
incentives for each of them are to

2242
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,679
deploy and i'm not saying there isn't

2243
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:48,960
i'm just saying it's not obvious to me

2244
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,320
like i'm having my hard time getting

2245
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,480
around that so if anyone could sort of

2246
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,480
speak to like look these are the

2247
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,320
different actors we need to successfully

2248
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,920
deploy a complete solution even though

2249
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,000
the itf's only doing a small part of it

2250
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,159
and these are the type of companies or

2251
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,159
operators that would do any of those i

2252
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:05,679
think that would really help me better

2253
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,480
understand uh the the likelihood of not

2254
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,320
us successfully writing some rfcs but

2255
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,080
those successfully being used in the

2256
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,559
real world

2257
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,719
is there anyone who could actually

2258
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,760
respond to that because i i can't even i

2259
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,400
can't do that

2260
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,480
hi i'm kate williams closer to the

2261
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,719
microphone you need to eat it got it all

2262
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,840
right

2263
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,040
i'm kay williams i am at microsoft and

2264
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,600
um we are uh

2265
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,159
we are we will be implementing uh

2266
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,920
something that is based on skid and

2267
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,600
making that available as a commercial

2268
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,679
offering

2269
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,920
was there more to the question than that

2270
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,199
um

2271
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:52,080
yeah i i think what cullen is asking

2272
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,520
is who are and i'm gonna try and see if

2273
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,280
i can restate your question a little

2274
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,320
colin

2275
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,840
i i think elliot

2276
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,710
i think the question was um like

2277
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,159
[Music]

2278
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:05,600
try it give it a try

2279
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,880
yeah which

2280
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,639
let me let me try and restate it in this

2281
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,400
way first of all who are the minimum

2282
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,639
number of players for for this for this

2283
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,719
architecture to succeed

2284
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,639
because cullen is basically saying you

2285
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:17,280
know

2286
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,560
it's very complex there are a lot of

2287
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,040
players it seems to me that the minimum

2288
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,360
number of players is really three

2289
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,440
um you know you have somebody who wants

2290
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,320
to

2291
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,920
uh assert uh a notarization you have the

2292
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,360
notary and you have somebody who wants

2293
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,719
to validate it

2294
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,320
you can have others as well but those

2295
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,559
seem to me to be the minimums am i wrong

2296
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,639
yeah i can uh mike perrock here i can

2297
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,280
talk to this a little bit uh you know

2298
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,880
working in different aspects of this and

2299
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,840
we're primarily looking at this from um

2300
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,679
you know validation of supply chains

2301
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,040
around machine learning and machine

2302
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,280
learning assets and i think the three is

2303
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,880
kind of the simplest construct right

2304
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,320
you've got someone who's creating some

2305
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,080
kind of software that says yup this is

2306
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,280
me

2307
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,360
here's the stuff i produce let's get a

2308
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,960
signature on this right you've

2309
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,960
ultimately been getting that at the

2310
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,639
notary level right this third party

2311
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,040
that's recording that log putting it in

2312
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,280
on you know some kind of a notary style

2313
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,360
ledger right that's append only

2314
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,880
and then you have this consumer side

2315
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,159
right i'm going to go look at this and

2316
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,560
decide do i trust that notary do i trust

2317
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,239
the people that were making claims about

2318
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:25,120
it and this is extremely in line with

2319
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,880
the kinds of software deployment stuff

2320
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,400
we have right when we're deploying

2321
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,400
something out open source

2322
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,920
uh cool like it's kind of on the

2323
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,840
consumer side to go trust that right and

2324
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,120
they're going to trust whatever they see

2325
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,719
around it who are the authors who is

2326
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,880
involved when i'm deploying something

2327
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,280
for a more secure environment

2328
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,639
typically you'll have a third party red

2329
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,320
team looking at this right and then

2330
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,080
taking their attestations and putting

2331
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,560
those things about that in some kind of

2332
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,120
right now usually a big old pile of word

2333
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,960
documents that they then hand to the

2334
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,320
customer who decides if they want to

2335
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
trust it and so it's very very similar

2336
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,840
to the exact model we have today it's

2337
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,600
just simplifying it and allowing for

2338
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,760
automated checks around this stuff and

2339
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,120
if we could do that in a standardized

2340
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,880
way it would be extremely helpful across

2341
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,159
the board for a lot of different

2342
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,400
problems but focusing on the software

2343
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,920
side as a starting place is good it's

2344
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,719
clean it's easy you know nothing is easy

2345
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,960
around this but it's it's the easiest of

2346
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,679
the ways we can go tackle this problem

2347
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,199
colin did that help you in any way

2348
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,239
is so i i get probably what one side of

2349
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,840
microsoft would be doing is microsoft

2350
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,440
planning on running a notary service as

2351
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,199
well

2352
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,920
it's i see people nodding so okay

2353
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,719
okay

2354
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,760
okay are there other people yeah

2355
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,639
yeah i can just say

2356
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,600
i mean if it's helpful for microsoft

2357
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,360
we're planning to be involved in a

2358
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,719
number of ways so we will be providing

2359
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,520
information about initially our software

2360
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,520
that we make available to the public for

2361
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,920
consumption through a service such as

2362
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,000
this we're also looking at beyond

2363
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,520
software we were listed just on the

2364
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,679
software side earlier but we're looking

2365
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,199
at this much broader than software we're

2366
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,040
looking at it also for our hardware

2367
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,400
products

2368
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,159
another way that we're looking at it is

2369
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,120
as a consumer of information from others

2370
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,679
so we want to be able to gate the

2371
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,679
software and the hardware that comes to

2372
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,719
us

2373
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,639
and we're looking at this as a solution

2374
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,480
where others can provide information

2375
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,719
that that we consume so we'll share with

2376
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,280
others we'll request from others and

2377
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,679
then we'll also provide services where

2378
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,840
um you know both microsoft can use and

2379
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,800
others um can use to stand up their own

2380
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
notary services

2381
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,719
good thanks i

2382
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,440
think i have to skip you because i'm

2383
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,800
worried that we won't get through the

2384
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,520
queue yeah on uh make it brief

2385
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,239
here on chef

2386
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,840
okay okay

2387
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,679
go ahead johan we're using the term uh

2388
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:53,920
transparency and we really mean

2389
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,600
immutable ledgers

2390
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,120
i would urge the group to decouple

2391
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,760
the the function of what you want out of

2392
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,120
this

2393
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,239
registry from the implementation

2394
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,239
i think for some use cases that

2395
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:12,080
transparency kind of thing is totally

2396
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,480
useless that specifically for internal

2397
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,120
enterprise registries it's a waste of

2398
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,560
time and money

2399
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,320
and i would claim that even in the

2400
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,400
big real world

2401
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,600
um certificate

2402
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,920
transparency has not been such a

2403
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,120
wonderful success as opposed to hey

2404
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,320
google just has a copy of each of the

2405
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,120
you know

2406
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,520
issued certificates

2407
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,560
so

2408
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,040
so again some people might want those

2409
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,679
immutable ledgers and that's fine but i

2410
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,080
would suggest that the rest apis at

2411
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,880
least or the the interfaces should not

2412
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,440
assume that okay that's a that's a good

2413
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,040
point uh definitely

2414
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,679
uh in favor of separating the

2415
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,360
functionality from the implementation i

2416
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,280
think that's in general what uh

2417
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,800
we do in the idea

2418
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,920
um

2419
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,520
next one chris from remote

2420
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,480
hi yes um i just wanted to quickly

2421
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,239
respond to yaran's comment i do believe

2422
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,120
the the contacts or the contents of the

2423
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,400
proposed charter and the documents that

2424
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,679
i've seen are written in such a way to

2425
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,600
allow that separation so you could for

2426
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,520
example deploy something that was not

2427
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,880
like fully transparent for some

2428
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,560
definition fully transparent with all

2429
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,480
the backing history and everything

2430
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,920
um

2431
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,679
uh of course you know as we get deeper

2432
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,600
deeper into the specs we'll figure out

2433
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,280
if that's actually true

2434
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,560
um

2435
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,520
on uh cullen's question with regards to

2436
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,639
you know who's interested in doing this

2437
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,400
stuff uh we're interested in looking at

2438
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,960
this as sort of a successor to earlier

2439
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,360
binary like transparency systems on the

2440
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,159
web

2441
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,960
um that provide more stronger guarantees

2442
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,520
for like browsers and other applications

2443
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,760
pulling down arbitrary code from

2444
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,000
untrusted contacts

2445
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,159
and making sure that they are safe

2446
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,320
earlier work i just dropped a reference

2447
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,199
to it

2448
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,800
in the chat was this thing called code

2449
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,920
verify

2450
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,199
with meta

2451
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:09,440
um or whatsapp and um but there's

2452
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,159
a natural progression of that work to

2453
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,800
something like skit uh especially

2454
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,480
six door slash whatever

2455
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,080
this you know the unification or

2456
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,360
convergence of these things happens to

2457
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,800
be um

2458
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,400
but i'm interested in experimenting with

2459
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,719
what is the successor to this initial

2460
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,880
um initial thing for

2461
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,639
uh transparency-like solutions on the

2462
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,159
web

2463
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:32,480
thank you

2464
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,400
thanks a lot chris and uh thanks for the

2465
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,638
link

2466
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,440
hey or ori steele from transmute um i

2467
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,040
just wanted to say uh you know we're

2468
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,480
planning to implement

2469
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,320
a version of this and we're interested

2470
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,440
in both

2471
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,760
both sides from the slide earlier so

2472
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,239
cyber physical supply chains you know

2473
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,239
software supply chain physical supply

2474
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,520
chain use cases i believe i agree with a

2475
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,960
lot of the framing that's happened on

2476
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,800
the mailing list around acknowledging

2477
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,239
that there are some generic building

2478
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,639
blocks here and in particular really

2479
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,960
leaning into cozy and the affordances

2480
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,520
that it has to solve these problems and

2481
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,760
um we're looking forward to implementing

2482
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,639
um whatever comes of this work thanks

2483
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,480
thanks thanks for the support

2484
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,360
yeah

2485
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,280
hi hi this is hank i'm currently not on

2486
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,080
thecube but my um echo uh

2487
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,000
played fun with me here okay go for i

2488
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,320
want to reply to vay's comment is way

2489
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,120
back sorry for the pun um

2490
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,199
so uh yeah uh

2491
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,760
rats can help

2492
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,320
but i think we deliberately

2493
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,520
kept them out of the initial chartering

2494
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,199
so that this was deliberate because we

2495
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:44,480
need to form uh the things you want to

2496
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,600
protect

2497
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,320
with authenticity and trustworthy proofs

2498
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
coming from rats first

2499
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,520
and then

2500
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,760
find the the nucleus where we attach

2501
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,840
them because this is a very big space

2502
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,320
and if we force everybody to rest i mean

2503
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,040
they issue a cell phone whatever taking

2504
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,639
that is too much

2505
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,560
so but but we are thinking about that so

2506
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,040
so don't worry it's not if you have it

2507
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,760
it's in sight but not in scope

2508
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,760
right now and i also want to highlight

2509
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,400
uh back to jeff um

2510
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,639
sharon's question about uh who might do

2511
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,400
this microphone mike go speak to him

2512
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,159
sorry sorry uh who wants to do this

2513
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,600
there was a list so i mean um

2514
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,480
hannes

2515
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,400
projected that he made a call on the

2516
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,199
list

2517
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:29,120
who wants to do this and there in the

2518
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,760
first day eight people said yeah

2519
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,880
so maybe maybe that that helps

2520
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,679
a little bit to

2521
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,920
reduce the concern here that people do

2522
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,199
not want to do this because i heard

2523
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,440
microsoft wants to do it but that's nice

2524
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,520
um there were there are others

2525
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,320
like a lot of others so maybe that helps

2526
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,520
yeah yeah here we go

2527
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,960
yeah that was the feedback on the list

2528
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,679
hi this is sachin here i just had a

2529
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:00,000
point about the previous one where the

2530
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,920
gentleman pointed out that key signing

2531
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,600
and everything is already being done in

2532
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,840
software and everyone can be a notary

2533
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,480
my own point is that the challenge that

2534
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,159
i think this thing is trying to solve is

2535
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,600
the fact that there's a centralized

2536
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,639
transparency thing and the idea of the

2537
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,360
offline receipt that people can validate

2538
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,040
i mean those are key concepts that don't

2539
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,120
rely on every user actually knowing

2540
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,600
everything about what's going on but

2541
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,320
i i have a place where i can take this

2542
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,239
proof and just validate it and say it's

2543
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,159
okay assuming that somebody has done due

2544
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,840
diligence just the way that you go and

2545
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,920
do buy a title to a house where the

2546
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,679
title leasing company has actually done

2547
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,800
due diligence so other than everybody

2548
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,920
trying to be

2549
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,920
uh get the title of the house verified

2550
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,199
and validated i have the central

2551
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,679
authority that says okay fine and assume

2552
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,080
let's say some sort of

2553
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,719
what you should say uh

2554
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,639
responsibility for that so i think

2555
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,000
that's one of the key things that we

2556
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,120
should point out that that is

2557
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,480
yeah thanks for pointing out this

2558
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,320
specific requirement on offline

2559
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,679
validation uh

2560
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,280
of course we will

2561
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,440
have to sort of go through some more

2562
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,159
collection of uh requirements and and

2563
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,320
looking at the threats etc to see what

2564
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,159
other things need to be added so that's

2565
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:15,760
uh but good catch yeah

2566
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,400
delaney elkins so now first don't get me

2567
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,440
wrong i totally support this but but

2568
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,440
we're an independent software vendor and

2569
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,520
we have to do this and so i'm just

2570
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,800
trying to figure out how to do it and

2571
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,560
one of the things it's like it's great

2572
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,880
you've got people who want to do it but

2573
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,800
a lot of the problem is going to be with

2574
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,960
the weakest link is the people who don't

2575
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,440
do it and then that that software gets

2576
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,880
embedded the way my customers deal with

2577
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,239
it today is we have a contract and in

2578
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:49,040
the contract is like if you take our

2579
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,320
business down we will take you down

2580
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,119
yeah

2581
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,360
that um yeah that's definitely a good

2582
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,440
and i think i think this aligns your

2583
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,360
comment the lines uh with what cullen

2584
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,560
has said

2585
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,800
uh in the sense that um looking at the

2586
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,960
incentives understanding the incentives

2587
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,080
for everyone who participates in uh

2588
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,679
these type of things these type of

2589
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:10,800
systems

2590
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:11,600
um

2591
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,840
at this stage we are mostly concerned

2592
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,800
about

2593
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,119
do you agree that there is a problem

2594
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,360
do we need to solve that problem

2595
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,119
and is this the right place to solve the

2596
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,199
problem and to work on a solution like

2597
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,360
how the exact solution looks like and

2598
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,000
who then based like obviously you can

2599
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,880
shape

2600
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,639
a solution in many different ways so

2601
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,960
that the responsibilities shift around

2602
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,719
that's something for the

2603
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,320
a future group

2604
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,719
not um like not at this stage yet

2605
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,080
because we don't know exactly how the

2606
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,239
solution would look like

2607
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,760
okay having said that um thank you

2608
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,600
so far thank you for the discussion now

2609
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,800
we go to

2610
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,800
an equally important part on

2611
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,119
sort of uh capturing your your

2612
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,320
impression

2613
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,239
by the poll

2614
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,119
let me

2615
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:58,960
put up the questions and i think we need

2616
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,080
to augment the questions on the generic

2617
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:06,040
versus software

2618
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,719
okay i

2619
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,960
i think we need to start with the

2620
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,000
problem statement one um

2621
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,440
and

2622
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,280
maybe roman you can help me here a

2623
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,199
little bit uh

2624
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,760
i think the question i i

2625
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,719
i think we should be asking is

2626
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:41,119
whether the the problem statement is um

2627
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,599
understood

2628
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,480
uh elliot are you going to do a pull or

2629
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,960
paul or who is going to do that

2630
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,880
i'll do it so

2631
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,360
the question is um

2632
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,320
uh you wanted to say understood or clear

2633
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,239
i think they're both synonymous to be

2634
01:36:58,239 --> 01:36:59,280
honest

2635
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,320
yeah

2636
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,760
pick whatever you want

2637
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,560
okay we're gonna start the poll in just

2638
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,679
a moment

2639
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,159
for that question

2640
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,360
um

2641
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,520
and let's see here

2642
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,119
you should now see this up

2643
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:16,400
excellent

2644
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,679
and we'll give it just a minute

2645
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,159
numbers are still going up a bit

2646
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,080
and

2647
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,280
still going up a little bit we'll give

2648
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,199
another

2649
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:42,159
20 30 seconds

2650
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,000
actually

2651
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,639
yeah just

2652
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,440
another a few moments okay i think it's

2653
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,960
pretty clear let me end the session here

2654
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,280
let's see here

2655
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,320
so there are the results

2656
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,679
yeah i agree it's pretty clear that

2657
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,400
do we have consensus but it's rough that

2658
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,679
we understand the problem statement

2659
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,840
given that we had some folks talking

2660
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,600
that they did not understand it that now

2661
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,960
would be a good time to come to the mic

2662
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,679
to

2663
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,320
to help us all understand

2664
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:21,590
[Music]

2665
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,159
but of course you can also post it to

2666
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:27,119
the

2667
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:30,480
to the list as well

2668
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,160
[Music]

2669
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,880
um you already know what i'm going to

2670
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,000
say

2671
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,080
but i'll say it again anyway i don't

2672
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,920
understand which security problems we're

2673
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,480
solving which specific security problems

2674
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,400
i see security solutions in the problem

2675
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,480
statement but i don't see the problems

2676
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,000
so i don't understand the problem

2677
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
statement

2678
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,159
okay uh sure

2679
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,639
yeah and i i have a similar concern in

2680
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,239
that there are lots of different

2681
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:05,920
problems in this space that we can solve

2682
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,360
and lots of different ways to solve them

2683
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,400
i'm not quite sure exactly how

2684
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,400
the notary fits in

2685
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,159
those

2686
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:14,800
k

2687
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,400
in which ones we're going to solve with

2688
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,480
notary how it fits in like i'm missing

2689
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,960
that bigger picture and maybe i have not

2690
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,320
you know

2691
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,440
been involved in enough of the

2692
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,600
discussions to see that but that's my

2693
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,000
concern right now

2694
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,679
so um

2695
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,840
hank you're next i'm hope you're going

2696
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
to address or attempt to address both

2697
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,480
brendan's and joe's point

2698
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,719
yeah i i i will try to this is hank i

2699
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,880
will try to

2700
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,679
so

2701
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:42,480
um

2702
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,960
yes the problem statement is phrased

2703
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,199
this way that we can agree upon this in

2704
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,880
this session

2705
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,159
that's sad that sad i think

2706
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,880
brendan is absolutely on track

2707
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,239
um they're

2708
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,880
in inside of the

2709
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,880
chart ring to some extent

2710
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,960
and then in a working group document to

2711
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,159
a very large extent we really have to

2712
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,719
lay out the threats

2713
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,320
and that is called threat modeling i'm

2714
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,880
not sure how popular i'm just right now

2715
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,800
with the itf saying that but this flat

2716
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,239
model thing

2717
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,760
really pays off

2718
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,360
because

2719
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,800
it really does sorry and so so yeah

2720
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,119
part of the work is creation of that

2721
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,880
threat model but i think

2722
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,600
initial chartering work would be um

2723
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,840
categorizing that and i think brandon

2724
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,960
would be a huge help

2725
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,960
others too

2726
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,920
okay

2727
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,080
yeah but um in other words what you're

2728
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,000
saying hank is um

2729
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,760
like we have to keep the

2730
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,320
some pro when we wrote the problem

2731
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,760
statement

2732
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760
it had to be short and so it couldn't

2733
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,320
capture everything and there's obviously

2734
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
supplementary documentation that will go

2735
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
into the details okay

2736
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,600
um just one point of information

2737
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,440
somebody put in the chat that the

2738
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,199
results of the polls don't show up in

2739
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,320
the recording so i'm just going to

2740
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,800
announce them here uh ray's hand for do

2741
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,159
you the question was do you think the

2742
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,159
revised problem statement is clear ray's

2743
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:12,320
hand was 56 people do not raise hand was

2744
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,759
13 people and participants were 69.

2745
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:20,480
go ahead okay thank you honest

2746
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,000
uh dick brooks

2747
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,040
i'm willing to bet that every person in

2748
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,400
this room

2749
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,880
has experienced what it's like to go to

2750
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,159
an app store

2751
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,880
and not be able to tell which apps were

2752
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,159
trustworthy

2753
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,639
you do a search you get a result of a

2754
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:37,600
dozen

2755
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,960
how do you know

2756
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,840
which of those is the most trustworthy

2757
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,199
so my response to brendan is brendan we

2758
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,360
need to give consumers

2759
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,080
better insight into the software

2760
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,600
trustworthiness

2761
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,199
that is that is completely blind to us

2762
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,239
today

2763
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,040
so

2764
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,360
what i think this group is doing

2765
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,040
is giving us

2766
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,760
the avenue or the at least

2767
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,280
the guys like microsoft who are going to

2768
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,000
host the registries and and people like

2769
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,239
rea which are very small company by the

2770
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:12,239
way we're committing to

2771
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,719
but we'll do it from the consumer side

2772
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,760
we'll query microsoft we'll give them

2773
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,560
here's the sha-256 key

2774
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,080
hash and here's the key identifier tell

2775
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,239
me if it's trustworthy that's what i

2776
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,400
hope to see okay

2777
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,880
uh dave please keep it short uh we need

2778
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,560
to do another

2779
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,880
raise another few questions god uh i

2780
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,000
raised my hand that i think it's clear

2781
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,440
but i think then brendan asked a good

2782
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,800
question i think the part that's

2783
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,040
relevant to i think the ad and knowing

2784
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,040
how to go forward is

2785
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,080
is it clear enough that the others is

2786
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,560
the threats that brennan is asking for

2787
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,440
is it okay for those to go into say work

2788
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,639
of the working group to say put it in

2789
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,239
the architecture document

2790
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:55,040
or

2791
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,560
is it something that needs to be known

2792
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,679
enough in the charter text okay that's

2793
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,679
relevant to the buff okay i raised my

2794
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:02,880
hand saying i think it's clear enough

2795
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,159
that i think cedric's presentation

2796
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,840
talked about enough that i think putting

2797
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,119
it into the architecture document is

2798
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,800
sufficient for me but i just want to

2799
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,320
clarify that's really the question the

2800
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,159
working group and what i think our ad

2801
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,920
would probably want to know is does this

2802
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,119
something that affects the charter and

2803
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,159
the scope or is this something that's

2804
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,239
just worked for the working group

2805
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,320
thanks dave that's a that's a good point

2806
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,040
okay um

2807
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,320
we want to bring up the next um

2808
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,719
which is the one about

2809
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:31,600
should the charter be

2810
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,480
focused on the software

2811
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,360
um supply chain use case or

2812
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,080
um should it be more generic

2813
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,000
right from the start we can like future

2814
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
we can always do things later but that's

2815
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,520
the question are you how do i phrase

2816
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,239
that best in

2817
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:53,320
roman is giving it a try yeah

2818
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,080
should the charter be

2819
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,820
focused exclusively on s-bomb

2820
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:02,159
[Music]

2821
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,000
yeah should be focused exclusively on

2822
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,280
the software supply chain

2823
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,760
okay i have that ready to go any any

2824
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,560
concerns with that

2825
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,080
no go for it

2826
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,400
okay

2827
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,199
it's like a game show huh

2828
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,719
you have the next poll and we people are

2829
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:29,320
if are invited to poll online

2830
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,159
and uh

2831
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:42,199
yeah this one's more interesting

2832
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,159
we'll give it just another moment and

2833
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:54,519
then we'll close the poll

2834
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,600
okay

2835
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,600
results are

2836
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,520
um should the question should the

2837
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,119
charter be focused exclusively on the

2838
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,800
software supply chain

2839
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,840
raise hand with 27 do not raise hand

2840
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,639
was 44 total participants

2841
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:21,520
um

2842
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,920
is uh 71 so

2843
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,240
um

2844
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,679
[Music]

2845
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:27,119
i would say that

2846
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,719
roman you have your work cut out for you

2847
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,320
as to how you want to interpret that

2848
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,840
that looks really rough let me think

2849
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,920
about that let's open the queue to talk

2850
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,840
about that result we need a finessing

2851
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,560
question yeah quick question

2852
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,880
because yeah quick clarification might

2853
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,199
be would you still participate and

2854
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:55,920
engage and think the work is important

2855
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,080
even if it was only limited to software

2856
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,679
because there are plenty of us working

2857
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,920
across multiple aspects of supply chain

2858
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,840
that still feel that it's very important

2859
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,760
this work moves forward regardless of

2860
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,600
how it's scoped initially

2861
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,960
can you say that more slowly

2862
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,800
sorry i i'm at point seven eckers um the

2863
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,880
uh no the

2864
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,920
you know

2865
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,920
would you still be willing to engage

2866
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,119
with the work

2867
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,600
uh and support the work even if it were

2868
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,560
only scoped to software to start right

2869
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,440
as part of the charter

2870
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
okay alyssa

2871
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,440
alyssa cooper i agree the question

2872
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,560
wasn't clear sorry elliot um

2873
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,239
i think there's kind of two things to

2874
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,159
think about here one is that it's not

2875
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:48,159
necessarily mutually exclusive like you

2876
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,760
can have this nice language that says

2877
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,600
you're going to prioritize software

2878
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,600
supply chain use cases but

2879
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,840
you know make every endeavor to

2880
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,600
build generalizable building blocks that

2881
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,080
can be used for other use cases and you

2882
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,960
can also say that um to the extent that

2883
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,000
it bears on the actual design and

2884
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,480
architecture that you can prioritize

2885
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,960
software-based use cases but um

2886
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,119
take the other ones in later after the

2887
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:15,440
core work to support software supply

2888
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,119
chain is completed so i don't think it's

2889
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:18,880
really like black and white and i think

2890
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,400
that's part of why you got

2891
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,480
a weird answer to the question

2892
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,840
so do you think

2893
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,239
alyssa must and may might might do the

2894
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,639
job there like must meet the needs of

2895
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,639
the software supply chain main the needs

2896
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:31,679
of other

2897
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,600
use cases

2898
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,000
i mean i'm not a super fan of using the

2899
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,560
normative keywords and charters but

2900
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,520
um

2901
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,760
it's it is like that's the same concept

2902
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,880
yeah

2903
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,159
yeah

2904
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,080
you need to see that

2905
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,600
all right we're going to run out of time

2906
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,360
if i let everyone kind of speak we're

2907
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,719
primarily using this to catch some early

2908
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:52,639
feedback i apologize we're going to kind

2909
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,159
of cut it because i want to get the next

2910
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,080
question so we get a positive result

2911
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,199
from the buff

2912
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,440
so we're going to kind of say we'll keep

2913
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,960
the queue as it is if you can kind of

2914
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,040
come back after we run the questions

2915
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,600
thanks so roman which question do you

2916
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,119
want to run next

2917
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:10,719
yeah i'm preparing the text

2918
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,360
okay yep

2919
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,119
so we're going to put the question of

2920
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,480
we're going to put the question in and

2921
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,760
i'm going to send it to you in chat

2922
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,280
elliott would you be willing to support

2923
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,840
the work if it was scoped to software to

2924
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,840
start

2925
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,199
okay i just um

2926
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:40,239
i think what i heard was yeah yeah yeah

2927
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,839
okay ready get set

2928
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,080
go

2929
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,080
and we're off to the races

2930
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,480
and look at

2931
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,040
that okay i think we're getting a very

2932
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,199
clear answer on that question

2933
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,560
so um last chance

2934
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,880
and

2935
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,199
the results to that question

2936
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:17,839
were 69 raised their hands four did not

2937
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,599
good so

2938
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:22,960
thank you for that question i think we

2939
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,119
got some conces consensus and we

2940
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:26,400
finessed

2941
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,080
some of this specialization versus

2942
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,000
generalization kind of with that item i

2943
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,520
think we want to talk about

2944
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,360
the energy questions

2945
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,400
yeah

2946
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,638
okay

2947
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,960
um

2948
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,480
the energy question

2949
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,760
willingness to review documents uh

2950
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,119
can you phrase something according to

2951
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:47,920
that

2952
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,400
yeah let's see who's actually engaged

2953
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,080
rather than being a tourist here on a

2954
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,320
first date

2955
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,960
okay here we go

2956
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,040
wow

2957
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,400
this is going to be like the most these

2958
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,520
are going to be like the most reviewed

2959
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,280
documents in history

2960
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,920
for the idea

2961
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,320
i think okay

2962
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,400
i'm going to just uh end this session at

2963
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,920
this point i think roman you have your

2964
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,960
answer there pretty clearly

2965
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,000
um we have 57 people already who are

2966
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,320
willing to to to review 11 said they're

2967
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,000
not willing to review

2968
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,679
um and they were total 68 participants

2969
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:41,040
um

2970
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,679
the next question is sort of the step up

2971
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:44,560
um

2972
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,360
sort of

2973
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,080
beyond willingness to review i actually

2974
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,199
willing to

2975
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:53,320
write the text um

2976
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:02,280
and here it comes

2977
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,799
holy

2978
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,560
this is going to be like the editor

2979
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,000
co-author working group those would be

2980
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
great

2981
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,080
okay so what's interesting is that there

2982
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,920
are 31 people at the moment who aren't

2983
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,040
willing but there are 31 people who are

2984
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,280
which is more than enough uh let me end

2985
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,840
this session

2986
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,199
yeah that's good enough thank you

2987
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,159
okay

2988
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,760
next what would be your preferred next

2989
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,199
question then we'll just move on the

2990
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,360
list

2991
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,840
uh so let's do the next uh question as

2992
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,560
we plan do you think about the charter

2993
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,080
from the slides

2994
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,599
okay basically do you support the

2995
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:56,800
current charter

2996
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,639
as we discussed it

2997
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,280
okay here it comes

2998
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:09,840
testing everybody's pop-up window size

2999
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,159
on this question

3000
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,719
all right just another moment

3001
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:34,880
okay

3002
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,210
and

3003
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:38,560
[Music]

3004
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,520
all right

3005
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,679
on that question

3006
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:43,040
um

3007
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,760
the there were 61 people who did raise

3008
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,520
their hand there are nine people who did

3009
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,080
not raise their hand and um

3010
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,000
just a reminder for people who are new

3011
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,239
to the ietf that we confirm things on

3012
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,719
mailing lists and in particular i would

3013
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,040
suggest that the nine people who did not

3014
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,199
raise their hands who had concerns

3015
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,719
should definitely raise those on the

3016
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,440
mailing list

3017
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,639
which brings us to our last question are

3018
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,719
we ready for that

3019
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:13,520
what did the question just now also

3020
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,639
address our last one

3021
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,080
i think it does from what i need i mean

3022
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,360
what it looks like we have here in the

3023
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,520
room is consensus to go with the charter

3024
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,639
we have

3025
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,320
i do recognize we we had some folks that

3026
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,159
did not support the charter i don't know

3027
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:31,679
whether it's outright or in the form it

3028
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:32,639
has

3029
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,400
given kind of where where we are with

3030
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,239
the clock we can actually collect i mean

3031
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:38,880
i i do welcome those folks to come to

3032
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,080
the mic but i think we are going to have

3033
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,360
to come to the mailing list because

3034
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,719
there may be an opportunity just to

3035
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,719
refine it a little bit more but in broad

3036
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:46,239
strokes i think we have something to

3037
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:47,840
move forward with with the working group

3038
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,760
but again to the mic if you are one of

3039
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,840
those kind of nine nine folks or perhaps

3040
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,280
you didn't participate at all that want

3041
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,639
to see a particular refinement thanks

3042
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,639
and i see

3043
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:01,280
thank thank you for for the for the uh

3044
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,960
response not anymore um

3045
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:08,880
so then i would also say there were some

3046
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,960
folks uh in the mic line how we were

3047
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,199
trying to finesse these questions that

3048
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:14,719
we turned away just so we can continue

3049
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,400
kind of pushing for that to fit inside

3050
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,639
the time if there is if there's anyone

3051
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:19,920
that wants to kind of return back to the

3052
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:22,000
mic as well to make that comment now is

3053
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
the time

3054
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,719
you have five more minutes if someone

3055
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:29,599
and while people are considering that

3056
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:31,119
ramon do you want to talk about what

3057
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:33,280
you're what your process is for the next

3058
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,280
steps

3059
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,239
yeah great point so my next process

3060
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,159
given what i heard which again i'll

3061
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:42,480
repeat is it looks like a strong

3062
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,239
consensus in this room to move forward

3063
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:45,679
with the charter we have in this forum

3064
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:46,480
is

3065
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,159
i would return back to the mailing list

3066
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,920
we have quite a lot of activity there so

3067
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,280
it's actually really nice to see that

3068
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,520
healthy discussion already i would drop

3069
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,520
the text we have here with the reminder

3070
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:58,000
that of the results here about the level

3071
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,840
of interest who's kind of what is

3072
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,360
interested in working on what and i

3073
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,199
would give it a little time to collect

3074
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:06,480
more feedback so uh probably next week

3075
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,239
after we all successfully travel home

3076
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,960
with no incidents of course uh

3077
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,159
i would probably give it around a two

3078
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:13,840
week call to see what we collect and

3079
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,800
whether that's going to be an

3080
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,119
opportunity to refine the text we have

3081
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:18,400
in some way

3082
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,920
or kind of change

3083
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,599
you know change a little bit of kind of

3084
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:22,960
what we're thinking so everyone that

3085
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,239
wants to say something concretely will

3086
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,080
have another opportunity and we have

3087
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,760
some folks now at the mic given my

3088
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,040
discussion of that

3089
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:32,400
hi stu card critical technologies with

3090
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,800
sedate again

3091
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,360
stu card critical technologies

3092
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,639
um

3093
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,639
a potential place to draw the circle

3094
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,639
that's somewhere in between software

3095
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,080
only which is still enough to be

3096
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,520
interesting and arbitrary things like qr

3097
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,080
codes on parts trays in a factory

3098
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,040
might be

3099
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:54,480
things that can run software including

3100
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,480
participation in cryptographic network

3101
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,040
protocols and that at least occasionally

3102
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,480
have network connectivity

3103
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
phillip

3104
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:20,400
yeah my problem with doing

3105
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,800
software as an example of something is

3106
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,920
that it is not a good example of parts

3107
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,760
so for example

3108
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:29,760
take github we've got a microsoft person

3109
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,880
here

3110
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,679
say github just started a notary

3111
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,560
and automatically through

3112
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,239
the apex of everybody's git commits

3113
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,880
into a notary chain like transparent and

3114
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,119
we do a merkle tree over it

3115
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,280
structured cryptography is amazingly

3116
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,800
powerful

3117
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:51,199
if you have that people can then throw

3118
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:55,360
ais at it and can analyze that data and

3119
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,840
can come out with

3120
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,480
you know really useful stuff on

3121
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,480
current risks today

3122
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,679
even if nobody else deploys

3123
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:06,639
and

3124
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,800
so when i start to look at the problem

3125
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,639
of software

3126
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,400
there's so many low-hanging fruit that

3127
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,000
you can get

3128
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:14,800
that

3129
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,320
don't apply to anything else

3130
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,400
and so that's the reason that i'm kind

3131
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,840
of like yeah i think that we should do

3132
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,719
software but

3133
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:26,880
i don't want to be coming along here

3134
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,679
with a solution that is good for

3135
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,080
software that is perfect for software

3136
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,800
and then say no phil that's not going to

3137
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,080
work on brake pads

3138
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,040
that's my problem i think that

3139
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,360
software is so generous it's a thing of

3140
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,760
its own type and

3141
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,840
you've got leverage there that you can't

3142
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,560
do anywhere else yeah you can't set an

3143
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,280
ai loose on brake pads

3144
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,840
and find out interesting stuff on them

3145
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,119
you can have ais look into software

3146
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:02,239
so it's not the same

3147
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,360
okay um

3148
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,599
i think we ran out of time

3149
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,599
and

3150
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:14,000
i would like to are we both are we three

3151
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,239
uh elliot roman and i would like to

3152
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:18,400
thank you for your participation and for

3153
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,639
the feedback you've provided and

3154
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:22,000
we hope to

3155
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,679
see all of you again on the mailing list

3156
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:25,920
discussing um

3157
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,280
the

3158
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,360
the actual documents and the work right

3159
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,520
yeah

3160
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,040
sorry elliot please

3161
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,400
yeah i'm just going to add

3162
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,639
congratulations to the the proponents of

3163
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:40,239
the the group who've been really working

3164
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:42,719
really hard to the participants in the

3165
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,480
on the mailing list looks like there's

3166
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,239
very productive discussions really
