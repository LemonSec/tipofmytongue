1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,880
hello hi this is greg um i have us right

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
at the top of the hour so uh i think

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,599
we'll just get started um i know it's

4
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,880
late for some folks um

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,200
who are in europe and um it's this is

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
going to be a small group i suspect so

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
we can be super informal about it um

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,440
i

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,399
uh the goal of the the goal of this um

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
session is really just to give a chance

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
to get uh reacquainted with mitiga if

i'll run through the slides uh with

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,119
there are only a few

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,080
but feel free to interrupt at any time

so

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,240
this

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
deck that you see is is

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
i created using this the template that's

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
available through the idf 114

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,119
um

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,159
preparation webpage uh under the chairs

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
on the chairs page so if you want to

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
uh

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,840
quick starting point for slides for your

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
your session if that your moderating or

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
that you're sharing um

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
feel free to grab those

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
they it includes the note well and then

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,520
it will apply to this session as it does

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,560
to all itf sessions

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
if you're a chair you're familiar with

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
this i'm sure um but it's always a good

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
reminder um

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
i take a look at it um at least three

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
times a year just to remind myself of it

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
and what's included in it

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
um it hasn't changed lately but it does

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
does change from time to time so it's

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
always good to take a look

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
and to remind folks who are in sessions

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
that it does apply

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
um

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
there are some

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
tips uh here uh they're pretty much the

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
same as

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
uh the last uh 113 uh for both in-person

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
and remote participants there are two

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,599
things that are not on this slide that i

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
want to highlight and they will be

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
included in the

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,519
standard standard template that is

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,959
available to use

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
first one is that

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,519
in

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
each of the meeting rooms you meeting

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,319
session rooms there'll be qr codes

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,080
that you can use

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,280
from phones to log in to the medical

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
lite client for that session so that's

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,959
super handy you can just walk into the

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,400
room scan the qr code and be and fire up

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
right away the um

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
the medical lite client for the system

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,319
that you're in um and all participants

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
in sessions will need to use medico

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
obviously remote participants will need

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,599
to use it because that's how they'll get

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
the audio in the video

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
and see the slides as we're doing now

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
but in person participants need to do it

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
as well for at least two reasons

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
the first one is that it will actually

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
automatically generate the blue sheet

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
for the session

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,799
um so by

87
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,440
logging into the medical lite client you

88
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
are automatically signing the blue sheet

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
which means you don't have to pass pens

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,280
and clipboards around anymore

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
and the other reason is because in the

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,159
sessions

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
medical will be used by both in-person

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
and

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
remote participants

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
to manage a

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,360
consolidated queue and we can test that

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
out here

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
but it worked really well at

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
itf 113

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
because that way chairs for example

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,879
didn't have to try and keep track of a

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
jab jabber queue versus uh in-person

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920
queue and everybody uh

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,239
who is joining medico

106
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
um

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,959
uh sorry who was in the session whether

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,720
the promoter in person could see the

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
medical cue

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
on the screen at the front of the

111
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
in-person room and obviously if you're

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,839
remote you see it in your medical window

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,798
um

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,079
so you'll see there's a little

115
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
screenshot there of what um the icons

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
look like in the new improved data

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
tracker agenda page um

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
the little phone is for the medical like

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
which is what uh people on site can use

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
and uh the full the camera is for the

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
full medical session which is what

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
remote participants must use

123
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,960
if you're in person you can use the full

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,040
version of mitiko but you just

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
for sure should not send audio or video

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
at all because those will be provided by

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
the in-room av setup so

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
um

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,000
yeah

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
one of the changes

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
relates to medical for this time around

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
relates to

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
actually both of the changes related to

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,759
chat but one is that medico now connects

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
to the zulip

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
um

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,080
group chat service that the itf is using

138
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
um sort of uh there's the follow-on to

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
jabber or xmpp so

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
uh it's now zulip um and it's seamless

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
if you're if you're using it through the

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
media gun it works just like like jabber

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,759
does

144
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
um and the other

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
chat related um

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
change is that uh

147
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
in the medico lite client there's a link

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
to the zulip chat room that was a

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
feature request that we heard

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
quite a bit

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
from 113

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
and now you can get to the zulu chat

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,080
room

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
via the light

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,039
session

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,520
and yeah and so there you go

157
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
joe is using the chat feature there to

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520

for um

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
uh the zulip's stream i guess is the

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
word for a particular medical

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360

session is is um related to um

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
but this is i think uh pretty

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
straightforward so

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,000
and i see andy has joined

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
actually as a zulu um user so

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
uh

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
i

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,039
don't

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
know if andy

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
that also means andy is in the room i

181
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
think it doesn't mean he's on the

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
medical bridge yet

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
but he's in the zulip room for this

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
session in the testing session

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
i've got that right

186
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
great uh

187
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,240

189
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,720
microphone um

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
uh

240
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920

244
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160

well you're here so uh you've made one

246
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
of the moderated test sessions which is

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
great

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
just a reminder that that web page is up

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
off the 114 page

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
and it has links to other

251
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
more specific

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
guides for either

253
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
participants or chairs

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
and each of those

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
guides have

256
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
a lot of detail about

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
things to consider

258
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
before you get to the um before you get

259
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
to the meeting and while you're at the

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,880
meeting uh the two two of those things

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
are

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
that in addition to these moderated uh

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
test sessions

264
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
uh which is

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
again moderated it's the wrong word it's

266
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
being me facilitated

267
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
because i'm not

268
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
there's no moderation going on but in

269
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
addition to this this test session and

270
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
the one that we have yesterday

271
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
there will be on-demand testing

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
beginning on 15th of july so um this is

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
a great way where you and there's a link

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
from from those um from that chair guide

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,519
on the website

276
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
to this tool where you can set up a

277
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
session a test session

278
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
for your group

279
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
the group that you chair

280
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
directly via

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
directly via the

282
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,399
scheduler

283
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,079
this doesn't create an interim meeting

284
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
or anything like that it just schedules

285
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
the

286
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
medico session

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
and then you can use that session at

288
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
whatever time works for you

289
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
to test out mitiga

290
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,839
with for example a

291
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
or your co-chair or both um so that you

292
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
can make sure that all the um

293
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
av setups that people might be using

294
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
especially if the remote uh work as

295
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,200
expected

296
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
um

297
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,360
yeah so that's um that's a really really

298
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,839
great feature uh and uh i highly

299
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
recommend it and it'll be available i

300
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
think at the end of the day tomorrow

301
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,760
there's one more session uh that needs

302
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
to happen and then the new version of

303
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
music will be deployed in the schedule

304
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,839
scheduler will be available to that so

305
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,200
you have a week

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
plus to try that try that out

307
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
and then in addition to that

308
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
we will have on-site testing available

309
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
at the

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
hotel venue the venue hotel

311
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,120
and there'll be a room set up just as it

312
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
will be set up for um

313
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,240
the sessions during the during the week

314
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
that you can go in and test out and get

315
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
comfortable with that as well if you if

316
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
you'd like um and there's a link to sign

317
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,600
up for a particular slot

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
on the chairs

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
preparation page

320
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
so if you want to pick a slot to meet

321
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
your

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
presenters or your co-chair on site

323
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
or if one of you is on site and the

324
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,440
other person is remote you can

325
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
agree to

326
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
join the test session

327
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,360
uh

328
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,160
so it's um it's a nice way to get uh

329
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
re-familiarized with with

330
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
the media set up on site

331
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
um

332
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,240
yeah so those are um

333
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,279
those are the testing opportunities for

334
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,279
medico between now and um

335
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,560
114

336
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
and i'm gonna pause here again in case

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,639
there's a there are a few tips uh that i

340
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,079
uh that um i wanted to offer based on

341
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
the experience from last time

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,959
uh

343
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
this the first one is

344
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,959
um

345
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
really the

346
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
best way to get

347
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,880
to share slides is to

348
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,079
upload them

349
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,959
to data tracker in advanced which i

350
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,800
think most people do

351
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
so that um

352
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
they're available both in data tracker

353
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,959
for participants but also

354
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
uh here

355
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
um

356
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,880
and uh what i can do is

357
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
i'll stop sharing

358
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,880
the slides here

359
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
and then i can show you i think

360
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
if i share my screen

361
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
what that feature

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,480
looks like and i will

363
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
share

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
this tab so

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
screen sharing and i'm apologies this is

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,959
just a

367
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
an artifact of the

368
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,760
recursive nature of sharing my screen

369
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,240
but if i share pre-loaded slides oh i

370
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
can't do that that's right sorry

371
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
anyway if you look at this icon here

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
you'll see that you'll have

373
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
options to share slides

374
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
that are pre-loaded

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
and you can in addition to drawing um

376
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
all the list of slides

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,720
uh

378
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
that are available from data tracker i

379
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,600
don't think this modal will show on my

380
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
screen share though

381
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
um

382
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
you can um you can share slot manage

383
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,279
share slides through the settings as

384
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
well there's a managedly slides here

385
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,480
yeah that model was showing up on the

386
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
oh fantastic

387
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
so let me go back to that um so you can

388
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
see all the data tracker materials

389
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
uh these are loaded in data tracker and

390
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,560
all these steps that are ready to be

391
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,519
shared

392
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
and then in addition you can see that

393
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
this test slides session down here at

394
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
the bottom

395
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,440
uh that's something that i uploaded um

396
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
directly to mitico so it's not it i

397
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,680
didn't upload a via the data tracker in

398
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
advance so that's a great feature which

399
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,959
um

400
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,199
uh you can do through that again through

401
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,440
that modal um is upload a new

402
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,760
deck if you have to uh

403
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
on the fly

404
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,399
um

405
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
but if again by uploading to medical the

406
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,399
slides it makes it much easier

407
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
especially for remote particip

408
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,440
participants

409
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,079
if they're sharing slides and you can

410
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,760
pass slide control

411
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
by using this feature

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
as a chair in a session so bias chair

413
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,920
will have this option you as a

414
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
participant in the session won't

415
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
but you can pass slide control to other

416
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
participants in the session

417
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,680
so that's a handy way to manage

418
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
slides and then you can you can

419
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,680
similarly take slide control back if a

420
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
participant has it

421
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,639
um

422
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
yeah so i'm going to stop sharing my

423
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,279
screen because that's annoying and i'll

424
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
go back to sharing the

425
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
test slides

426
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
um

427
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
the other the only other thing because

428
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,720
this just came up if somebody asked me

429
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160
about this um

430
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,199
if for some reason you have video uh

431
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,399
within a presentation

432
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
that's best coordinated uh

433
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
with medico in advance

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
um so that's something where you'll want

435
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,279
to let

436
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
you can just send a note to support

437
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
ietf.org

438
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
and say hey we're going to have a video

439
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
during this session that we want to make

440
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
sure to share

441
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
and uh

442
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
medical will help work that out

443
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
because video doesn't do great

444
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
through screen sharing again it's just

445
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,839
not not as

446
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,160
as nice and tidy as if it's managed

447
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
centrally

448
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
uh there's one more thing i want to

449
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
share for sure

450
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,759
um

451
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,680
but uh again i'll pause there and see if

452
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
there are any questions about

453
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
that

454
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,600
any of that

455
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
or anything else

456
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,639
that i haven't mentioned

457
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,040
okay uh great the last thing i wanted to

458
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,720
make sure to cover was how to get help

459
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
if you need help um so if you know you

460
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,440
have a question before 114 starts uh the

461
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
best thing to do is just to

462
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
send an email to support itf.org and

463
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,160
it'll get routed to this to the right

464
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,919
folks um

465
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
it's um yeah so

466
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,599
if something you have a question about

467
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
something

468
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,280
at the meeting uh including your

469
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,039
particular session at the meeting you

470
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,400
can just send the email to support

471
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
itf.org

472
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,919
um if something comes up during the

473
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
session that you're chairing

474
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,640
um

475
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,760
the thing to do is to type into the chat

476
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,039
um into the meet echo chat um

477
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
uh a comment or a question that starts

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
with meat echo

479
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,039
because medico monitors all the sessions

480
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,400
that are going on

481
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
um but you know they're taking care of a

482
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
lot of things all at once

483
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
but they do have a way where if mitiko

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,039
appears in the chat uh i don't know if

485
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,480
sirens or something go off something

486
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,440
magic happens and they will take a look

487
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
and see what they can do to work it out

488
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
so either support itf.org

489
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,320
before your session if something comes

490
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
up during the session just type in

491
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,919
midiko and then

492
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,000
what whatever you need help with or the

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,559
question you have into the chat and

494
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,840
someone will

495
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
um get back

496
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,960
uh right away if they a lot of times

497
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
what happens is the issue comes up and

498
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
medical is monitoring the session and

499
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
they proactively take care of it which

500
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,960
is amazing um but if that doesn't happen

501
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
or if there's a general question you can

502
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,160
just type me to go in the chat

503
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,520
wow uh i'm oh hey go ahead joe

504
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,400
is is it just mitico or an app medical

505
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
or just the word mutico

506
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
i think just the word medico but maybe

507
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,760
if alessandro if i can test it see if

508
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,000
mitika is listening now

509
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
yeah it's anything that contains the

510
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
word medec oh yeah

511
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,039
