1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,759
it's a it's a kind of uh we all know

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,519
it's a failed opportunity on our part

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,240
but

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
um you know

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,040
but for this one we have a chance

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
we can only push strings so far

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,600
is the point

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
right

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
i like this one at some point at some

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
point if no one's pulling on the string

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
it never goes anywhere so

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
you know that's what we have to do

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
okay okay

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,840

open issues

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
all the variable is back to the working

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
group and that's where we are addressing

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
the open issues to be able to

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,959
send it back to this team uh though

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
projections are going to be discussed

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,200
today as mentioned previously and

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
noticed that this document is in working

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,640
group last call

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,040
for several weeks already and we haven't

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,599
received any objections so

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
today we want to know their opinion

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,440
and

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
if you agree

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,879
with the document we can just close the

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,480
investment

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,599
and then the enderman priority

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
now those are working in addressing open

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
issues

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
mopeds and capabilities are waiting for

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
attention

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
they were

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
expired

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
in november last year

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
so we need to return to work on those

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,640
um

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
as well we want to

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
form

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
ribbon steering root act we would like

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
to

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
again issue the working group adoption

104

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,478
uh for nfp

106
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,560
this work was adopted by the working

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
group

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
review is needed probably we will need

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
to set up work events to work on this

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
tomb

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
but now we want to focus attentions on

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
dow projections in the document that we

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,320
have working with

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
thank you then we have our milestones

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,520

for this year

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,000
we aim for the projection enderman

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,720
priority on muppets if possible and as

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
well

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
close led ripple

121
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
and then for next year the rest of the

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
documents

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,600
including the evaluation but

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
we have to

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
recharge their clothes

126
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
as well probably start their repair

127
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
version 2

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,639
or rebuild these

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
and then we have a bed lincolns for

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
urban priority how the rivers and they

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
were closed but they are listing some

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
open

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
then as well for ripple observations we

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,520
have future work items

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
more books we have one

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
um

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
then i just want to mention that on

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,240
friday

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
we are going to have a

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
month in the money

141
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
meeting there going to be a discussion

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
of multicast

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,919
um

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,720
with the bible and roll

145
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
um

146
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
so we would like you to participate um

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
and yes um there is a agenda basically

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
present multicast in barbell house

149
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
multicast in the end

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,120
we manage as well so

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
this is as well kind of a brainstorming

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
uh how to address multicast

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
but i think it will be interesting

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
and i think following this meeting there

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
is a buff on multicast as well

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,440
so

157
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
yes

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
a lot of work on those topics

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
okay thank you

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
pascal the flooring source i will pass

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,759

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
video

165
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
um

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
hello guys

167
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
so very very sad not to be with you

168
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,240
today

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
but yes we will do it remotely

170
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
and so

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,919
um

172
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
this is about the dow projection so

173
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
cincinnas has already

174
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
introduced the situation

175
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,160
so um this is basically what we do we

176
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
build

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
instances within instances and you can

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,639
uh you can call them overlays and the

179
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
overlays take the usual shape of a

180
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,639
traditional ripple instance meaning that

181
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
it's a geodag and and it reaches some

182
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
targets which are considered as

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
external destination in rfc 9008

184
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,319
and basically to reach them from an

185
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,479
ingress point which acts as root you

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
need to build a deodag and

187
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
we use

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
typically non-storing mode to to have

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
the dotted lines and storing mode to

190
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
join the dots basically

191
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,639
so

192
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
this is the things that we are building

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
we call track

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
a complex dotted line uh

195
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
basically a geodag a complex expression

196
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,800
of a of a potential for a path between

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720
an ingress and an egress

198
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,599
and we call a segment a serial

199
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,879
direct

200
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,360
sequence of nodes which we can install

201
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
using storing mode for instance in black

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
on the top you see a story mode pedal

203
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
which installs a segment between a relay

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,879
a

205
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
and a e

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,440
um

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
so so basically you can also see that as

208
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,879
a way to use

209
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
ripple to do traffic engineering and

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,520
really to install what row

211
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
will be using

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
to make wireless a lot more reliable

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
so summary of the recent changes so we

214
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
had a number of reviews we had lee it

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,120
took two round three to to go through

216
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
um

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
the the edit the second round included

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
michael's editions about amman's and

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,839
extends

220
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
and since then i've tried and thanks for

221
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
dominique and dinners to remind me but

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,959
i've tried to uh to use ameld when it

223
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
was needed

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
um

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,920
25 included a rewarding of

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
terminology to make sure the terminology

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
was more clear

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
on the concept of legs which is one

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,240
possible path along the track source

230
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
right path along the track

231
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
um and and

232
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,839
possibly a sequence of segments to get

233
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,200
there

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
then 26 was remove series so we we uh

235
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
the chairs are screamers to to do uh a

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
deep uh review as well so it was it was

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,320
quite instant

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
intense but uh i think there was one bug

239
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
that he found and for the most piece it

240
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
was a lot of cleaning up

241
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
um

242
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
and so his review the second step of his

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,920
review went in 27 with dominic's review

244
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
so then again dominic was very kind to

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
to propose like every most for the typos

246
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
a

247
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,279
pro request so that's really appreciated

248
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
saves a lot of time processing

249
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,880
uh so that was neat and then um dominic

250
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
had these comments in line in the in the

251
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
pro request so so i handled them in line

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
that we actually use get to discuss but

253
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
i i copy the main results on the mailing

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
list as well so all the gory details can

255
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
be seen on github

256
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
and the summary of the changes in the

257
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,680
mailing list

258
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,279
so

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
there were a number of interesting

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
issues that were raised directly or

261
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
indirectly by dominic's review first

262
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
thing is and i think it's quite

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
important um

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,839
the the

265
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
sibling information option basically

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
gives you

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,750
um

268
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,399
[Music]

269
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,839
so a node

270
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,160
it sends a daw with an sio in it and

271
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
basically what it says is i've got all

272
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
those siblings so these are the nodes

273
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
which are one hop away from me which i

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,760
can directly route to

275
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,720
so

276
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
basically that means for instance if the

277
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
root wants to get one of those notes

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
along the path i can forward to him he's

279
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
mine it can be a next stop or if he's a

280
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
target then you can you can build a

281
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399
track which terminates as me egress and

282
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
i can reach those siblings

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
but

284
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,279
it can also mean if you have a packet

285
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,839
um to give to those guys even if it's

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
not a track anything if you give it to

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
me i can give it to him directly

288
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
and this really reminds of a next star

289
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
preservation protocol

290
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
uh i guess in many they've got

291
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,160
variations around that i'm pretty sure

292
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,839
you can basically say hey if i'm one hop

293
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,240
away from the destination well two hops

294
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
i have one neighbor which is a neighbor

295
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
then we don't need rating

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,399
multicast now in ripple was initially

297
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
without siblings just for direct

298
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,079
connectivity i'm sure

299
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,160
i broadcast the multicast

300
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
everybody around me knows i'm here no

301
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
need to use a ripple path to get to me

302
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440
we are neighbors

303
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,920
with the sio we extend this to two

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
halves

305
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
it's one of the consequences of having

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
an sio is we can we can do two halves

307
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
away and it's loopless it's just having

308
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
a common neighbor that can rely

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
so it was there but it was not clearly

310
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,279
stated and doing the changes for dominic

311
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,519
i realized that it was important to make

312
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
it more clear

313
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
and in particular what was missing is we

314
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,959
were not amending

315
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,880
rc6550 on the multicast now

316
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,200
the multicast though was explicitly for

317
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
one half and now because we have cio we

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
can make it to hops

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,959
so so i i made the changes to make that

320
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
very explicit and i did a sentence which

321
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
talks about amending your c650

322
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
um so

323
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
yeah and by the way there is one api

324
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
which was

325
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
related so it's not fully that it's

326
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,000
never fully that but

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,800
um just in case i asked the lawyers to

328
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
to add that ipr we already had cisco apr

329
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
on this draft so this is the second

330
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
cisco apr on the draft which will i mean

331
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
the guy promised me that he will push it

332
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,399
just now

333
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
so before before we do the shepherd call

334
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
i will make sure that the second apr

335
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
which really relates well at some point

336
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
it uses those two hop things

337
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,320
so it's quite useful in fact

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,360
so so i will declare this app here

339
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
next slide please

340
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
oh it's me i forgot hey

341
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
yeah so um another thing which came up

342
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
as part of the discussion with dominic

343
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,079
and that one also is important

344
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,079
uh forever we had that discussion about

345
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
loop avoidance i mean we have we are in

346
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,440
a situation that we used to call

347
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
multi-topology writing

348
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
where you have the main topology which

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
is the main report diode x or the

350
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
underlay if you like

351
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,360
and you've got the track which is which

352
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
is an overlay

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
and when you do multi-topology routing

354
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
if you let a packet bounce between

355
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
topologies it can look

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,680
just depends on the way the topologies

357
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,519
are organized so it's very important

358
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
that the topologies you're manipulating

359
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
or basically the rules that you're using

360
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,120
for writing

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
have a strict order so you can go from

362
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
this to that and this to that and this

363
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
to that but never the other way around

364
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
otherwise you have a chance of loop

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,560
so

366
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,839
we we are the the text that we had was

367
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
clear that

368
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
in the cons context of forwarding along

369
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
the loose

370
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
track so to the loose hops

371
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,820
that um

372
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,079
[Music]

373
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,279
you could use either the next up

374
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,000
which is a segment to get to the next

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,519
loose hub

376
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,120
uh you could use a direct neighbor or

377
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
via a command neighbor using the

378
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
you know that's when we found that the

379
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
sio discussion was missing but basically

380
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
if if you have a packet you're you're a

381
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
logger truck you're one of those loose

382
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,639
hops

383
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
if the destination is direct one hop

384
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,839
then

385
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
pass it to him

386
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
if it's not but you have a common

387
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
neighbor then pass it to him if not but

388
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
you have a segment route

389
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
basically a story mode dao which reaches

390
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
the next loose hop

391
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,279
use that

392
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,760
else it could be encapsulating inside

393
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
another track which effectively gets to

394
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
the next loose help do that which

395
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
creates a new encapsulation but that's

396
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
still okay else drop

397
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
so you you add all those methods but

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,440
what you didn't have is a strict order

399
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,800
of them

400
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,040
so we we clarified that to avoid loops

401
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,639
basically do there is there is not only

402
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
a preference to use direct top if you

403
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,920
have else common neighbor etc but it's

404
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
also a precedence meaning that

405
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,399
you you can

406
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,120
never take a packet

407
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
uh

408
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
off a segment and put it in a different

409
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
track

410
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,000
if if you are rotting due to the common

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
neighbor never put it in a segment

412
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
it's it's it's it's

413
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
it would be the recipe to disaster

414
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,079
tulips

415
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
so the the text is is now i hope more

416
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,959
clear about that

417
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,920
um

418
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
there are two things though one of them

419
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
is a very old

420
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
a pull request which really does not

421
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
apply to the text at all anymore

422
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,759
but

423
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
maybe there is something to dig into it

424
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
they don't know if halle is with us but

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
howell basically is the one who made

426
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,320
that poll request and i would have liked

427
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,480
raul to shine in and and look at you

428
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
know the new the new way we do a group

429
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
of items basically

430
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
if it matches his intention in this poor

431
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
request the second thing is

432
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
uh this preference of you know using a

433
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
direct harp and then a common neighbor

434
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,560
since segment is is on the right you

435
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
know it's less

436
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
preferred forwarding a longer segment

437
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,839
can

438
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,760
use a direct hub but it could also use a

439
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,839
common neighbor so today the way

440
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
the segment is is written is you have to

441
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,400
be

442
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,880
in direct site to the next step in the

443
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,520
segment it is a straight thing

444
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,559
but

445
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
we could have made it

446
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,280
one hop loose basically the segment

447
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
could be

448
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,480
you could be relaying to someone which

449
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,840
is not your direct neighbor but the

450
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
neighbor of a neighbor

451
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
and that you would know

452
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
using sio

453
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
it's just not done

454
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
i don't think it's

455
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,679
we want to to to take a big risk and

456
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
change that inside the segment but when

457
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
the segment you you you're done with the

458
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
segment that you have to deliver at

459
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
least the destination could be via

460
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
common neighbor

461
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
but anyway the way it's written right

462
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
now is when you forward the longer pedal

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,960
uh which is a story mode pda or segment

464
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
um it has to be a hub by hop strictly

465
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,720
when you forward along the track

466
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
it can and uh

467
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
you have to deliver a packet that you

468
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
know just you know lose heart and you

469
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
look at how to forward it

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
then uh you can use the one hop two

471
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,559
halves other than the segment

472
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,799
so there is a slight inconsistency if

473
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
you look at the strict order

474
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
uh two

475
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,799
common neighbor is acceptable is

476
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,360
has more precedence than segment so

477
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
common neighbor will not loop even if

478
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
you forward inside the segment at this

479
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
time

480
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
it might not be very clear the way i

481
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,559
said

482
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,600
but

483
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,760
basically the question is should we

484
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,799
allow

485
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,720
to forward the outcome and neighbor as

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
we write along the segment and mostly

487
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
when we deliver the aggressor segment

488
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
it's not fully consistent the fact that

489
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
we we allow it for tracks but not for

490
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,840
segments

491
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
just because i didn't change the text

492
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,120
and

493
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
did not want to i wanted discussion on

494
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,240
this

495
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
so i hope we come back to that

496
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
and that's pretty much it um by the way

497
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
there is a 28 on the works

498
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,600
because i got the new feedback uh from

499
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,400
dominique after 27

500
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
and

501
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,799
we found that

502
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,600
something else of interest was

503
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
was missing

504
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
um

505
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
so it is

506
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
let me find

507
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,399
maybe i can share the divs

508
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
yes so

509
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
the the bottom line is

510
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
we

511
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
didn't clarify this document something

512
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
which is very clear in the main ripple

513
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
spec

514
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
which is that each ripple instance

515
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
it's on rib it's it's a vrf if you like

516
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
it's it's it's it's on rip so when a

517
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,400
ripple node runs two instances already

518
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
with 650

519
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
when you forward along a a a a an

520
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,559
instance

521
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
you really use one verb and when if you

522
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
can never go from one instance to the

523
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
other it was already there it was

524
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
important they are shipping the night

525
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
and that's why we tagged the packet with

526
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
the hub by hub option the ripple up

527
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,000
the api basically the rpi tells us what

528
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
instance that is that allows us to look

529
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
at which rib we forward against and we

530
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
can only use this rep that's why again

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
we avoid loops in this

532
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
multi topology routing thing it was

533
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,039
already there with ripple

534
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,000
but

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,080
it was not really

536
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,960
said

537
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
again in this document

538
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,159
that

539
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,559
yeah even if you do an overlay inside

540
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,960
the main dodge it's still another dag so

541
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,559
it's still another instance

542
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,720
and still it's a different trap

543
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
and you have to forward along that trip

544
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
you know

545
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
unless unless you have a common neighbor

546
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
unless you have a one hub

547
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
so

548
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
i i added some text to just clarify that

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
it doesn't change anything it just

550
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,799
clarifies that hey each instance is a

551
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
rip for the for the router multiple

552
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
instances multiple reps

553
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
and then forward along

554
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
so so that's that's one thing you will

555
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
find 28 and if there are commands today

556
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
then i'd be glad to add them to 28 as

557
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,240
well and then i can publish it

558
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,399
so

559
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
so any comment

560
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,840
on this

561
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,159
i can't see any comment in the room

562
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
anything in the chat

563
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
nope

564
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
so everyone accept this via neighbor

565
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,679
sorry

566
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
uh about the proposal that

567
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
you say common neighbor i think

568
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,799
it's okay but

569
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
some comments about that

570
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,200
and just yeah think about next stop

571
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
reservation protocol next up discovery

572
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
protocol

573
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
it's it's basically the fact that if you

574
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,880
have a common neighbor then it will

575
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
relay without the loop and without a

576
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
writing protocol i mean that's that's in

577
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
money that's a

578
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
usual thing just that triple was not

579
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,559
using it because we didn't have the

580
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,240
sibling but now we have it so we need to

581
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,280
average it in full

582
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,080
about overlapping legs when it will be

583
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,760
needed

584
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
because it's not clear to me so much

585
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
what what will be needed i'm sorry uh

586
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
sorry overlapping legs

587
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,400
um interlac segments

588
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,120
like north south

589
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
oh when you expect

590
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
no sights no stars we cannot do

591
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,960
because

592
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,760
um so if you go that's when we refer to

593
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
the raw architecture so that's that's

594
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
another interesting discussion and uh

595
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
alvaro is in the room so i will like

596
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
just to say hey i will run for you here

597
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
um

598
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
basically one one consumer for what we

599
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,840
are doing here is raw

600
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
wood needs

601
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,760
those tracks

602
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
and row has defined them so i i

603
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
refrained to do too much definition this

604
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
document wanted to keep the two

605
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
completely consistent

606
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,679
and so raw as a concept of track which

607
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,679
is a little bit wider than what ripple

608
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,279
can build

609
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,159
because in repo we have a dodec meaning

610
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
that all the links are oriented so you

611
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
go east-west from source to destination

612
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,200
with

613
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
a

614
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
row there is also north south

615
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,919
north south is bi-directional you can

616
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,559
use it up down or down up

617
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
just don't want to loop so you must have

618
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
something which tells you how not to

619
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,880
look for instance a source route but the

620
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,679
link could be used in both directions

621
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
and the reason for that is in a row

622
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
sometimes you want to do checkpoints

623
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,600
to make sure that the packet for

624
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,120
instance if you have a

625
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,240
north

626
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
path and a south path having a

627
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,559
north-south link to connect the two

628
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
allows you to check if both hands have

629
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,320
received the packet and if they don't

630
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
then they share it so now both hands

631
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,960
have the packet and you can fall so you

632
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
can basically replicate over the north

633
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
south in either direction to make sure

634
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
that the packet is is there and then you

635
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
can continue to to the west

636
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
this capability is not present with

637
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
ripple because ripple does not signal

638
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,480
um sibling rods basically rats which

639
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,360
would be

640
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,080
between notes of the same cost

641
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
uh it was proposed very early in the

642
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
design of ripple

643
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
because of one big

644
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
drawback of geodex which is basically

645
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,559
that the node which is closest to the

646
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,039
root has no plan b

647
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,799
because every link is oriented at least

648
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
the node which has half of the load

649
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
under his heart on his arms you know

650
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
because it's close to the root it's just

651
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,200
one half away from the root well because

652
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
he's the closest

653
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
he cannot he cannot not have a plan but

654
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,039
he cannot pass it to somebody else if

655
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,440
the connection to the root is is dead so

656
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,240
so yeah half of the traffic or so and no

657
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,960
plan b so rotting between siblings

658
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,320
around the root for instance would have

659
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,440
been useful

660
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,520
but we decided not to do it so ripple

661
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
does not have no cells

662
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,039
still today

663
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,840
so that's why a row has a little bit

664
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,720
more

665
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
than what ripple can build

666
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
we can always discuss in the future how

667
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
we do nerf cells but

668
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
the the use case is basically the scene

669
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
as if you want to replicate a packet on

670
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
two path

671
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
and you want to verify at some point in

672
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,919
the middle that both sides the packet is

673
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,679
still there was not lost

674
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
then you can reconcile you can think

675
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
about this north south

676
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,200
and basically the first one which has it

677
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
passed it into the other universe is

678
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
that oh i got it from him it won't pass

679
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,480
him

680
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
but if i didn't get it from him i will

681
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
pass him and you see this kind of rule

682
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,840
and so you're sure that both sides of

683
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,720
the

684
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
segment now they have the copy and it

685
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,279
can progress against to the west

686
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,080
that's replication form

687
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
okay thank you

688
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
and can you mainly uh how can we

689
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
differentiate from a track from a

690
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
complex drug basically there is a metric

691
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
or basically if they have a lot of

692
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,440
segments

693
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
the term complete track was there to

694
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
just explain that it's not serial

695
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,000
you know

696
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
if you express something f a

697
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,880
dot b that dot c

698
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
and that would be your

699
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,960
simple track basically serial track

700
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
and now you would have segments between

701
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
a and b and b and c which would be the

702
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
the one hop

703
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,919
storing mode thing

704
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,039
um

705
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,000
now if

706
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
with this if you lose the packet there

707
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
is no way to to get it to destination

708
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
if you have more than one possible path

709
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,760
then you have a complex track

710
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
um the track is

711
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
is a potential you can send your packet

712
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
along this diode

713
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
you know and when it forks you can

714
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
choose to send it up through the up path

715
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
or the down path i mean each time it

716
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
works or you can decide to replicate or

717
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
anything that's raw

718
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,399
so how you use it is really wrong but um

719
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,240
basically it's no opportunity see the

720
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,720
track as an opportunity if a packet is

721
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
not replicated then

722
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
when you forward then you have more than

723
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,159
one next step you choose one that's what

724
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,159
you typically do with repo

725
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,440
you choose one

726
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
typically for instance you use your

727
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,039
preferred parent to go to the route but

728
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
you have an alternate parent you could

729
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,919
have passed the packet to him it would

730
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
have gotten there

731
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,120
so so the dag is a potential

732
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,840
a certain packet will experience one of

733
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
those potentials

734
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,039
it's gonna be the path

735
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
so the path is the actual experience of

736
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,279
one packet a different packet may

737
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
experience a different path between the

738
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
same a and the same b if you have a

739
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
diode between the two and and you load

740
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
balance or do whatever

741
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
so so the path is different from the

742
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
track the track the potential it's the

743
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,880
global set of everything that's possible

744
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,799
and the path is the experience of one

745
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
given packet

746
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,679
yes

747
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,900
okay thank you

749
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
more questions in the comments

750
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,480
so there is any objections to

751
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,279
close the working glass call after these

752
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,399
issues mentioned by pascal where raised

753
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,640
are addressed in the version 28.

754
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,600
um

755
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
maybe again yes stated differently

756
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
pascal we've been in working group last

757
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,279
call for

758
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,559
quite

759
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,520
a few weeks maybe a few months already

760
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,200
what's your opinion on the stability and

761
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,120
convergence of this document

762
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,480
given the the various changes addition

763
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,279
that

764
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
have been made in the

765
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
recent weeks

766
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
that's your feeling

767
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
well

768
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,000
for the most thing i would say that we

769
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,080
have

770
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,919
it's a lot of

771
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
clarification

772
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,000
uh for instance what i just said today

773
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,039
uh you know reply to you on on the email

774
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
is something that has always been there

775
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,559
each instance is a red

776
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,520
but

777
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,679
it was not written so so i think it's

778
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
all going the right direction the only

779
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,799
thing which and it's nothing new

780
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
the the thing that which the most

781
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,279
surprising thing might be this this sio

782
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,080
thing

783
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
which maybe people did not realize it

784
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
was there so um

785
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
so

786
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
again it's clarification

787
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,679
so i just

788
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
voiced it on the mailing list in your

789
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,120
reply i made a point today

790
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,679
so i hope if somebody has a problem with

791
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,559
that

792
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,840
but you know it's it's a very

793
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,000
traditional thing to to to be able to

794
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,159
write through one help

795
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
so i would be surprised know that

796
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
somebody shines in but if somebody

797
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,240
shines in you know today or on the

798
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
mailing list

799
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
uh happy to address that but no it's i

800
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
mean you've seen the fixes that you've

801
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
proposed right you you made the document

802
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
a lot more readable

803
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,360
and the guys before you i mean tourists

804
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,480
for instance

805
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,799
i spent a lot of time asking me to to

806
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
reorganize to help the first reader then

807
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
we had all the reviews that i showed i

808
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,720
mean we had a good number of reviews if

809
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,120
you look at my slides for the previous

810
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
ietf and the one before i always you

811
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,120
know retrofit the last

812
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
four or five

813

[Music]

814
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,720
the items you've seen it's a lot of of

815
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,279
clarification a lot of

816
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,960
um

817
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
typos as well sorry for that

818
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,360
but it's all going in one direction

819
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,279
that's basically my answer to you

820
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,679
we have not fought we have not we have

821
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,000
refined clarified

822
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,480
but i i don't think we

823
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,360
it's all stabilization it's not forking

824
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,880
to something completely new at the last

825
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
minute

826
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
so i'm good i mean basically

827
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,600
okay so i'm hearing from your point of

828
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,399
view we have converged on this document

829
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,279
yes and i'm sorry because i was i was uh

830
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,200
telling alvaro i have a point for you

831
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,519
the point for you alvaro was that

832
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,320
i'm

833
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,679
referring the raw architecture

834
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
for the terminology of trucks

835
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,640
and because it's terminology

836
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
i made it

837
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,519
the normative reference

838
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
problem is the raw architecture is

839
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,760
still in the works i mean it's in

840
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,399
lascaux type of situation

841
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,640
but it's still on the works

842
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
and so

843
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,399
and and by the way i'm pretty sure it's

844
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,799
going to end up as an informational

845
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,720
so we will be in this

846
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,600
um

847
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
double situation of of a

848
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
done ref

849
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,519
to informational

850
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
and

851
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
basically this document will be held by

852
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,440
the raw architecture

853
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
the alternate was to redefine the

854
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,960
terminology from the raw architecture

855
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,799
into this document

856
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,519
so what do we want to do i think it's

857
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,279
more correct to do it the way i did it

858
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,720
so i did it but

859
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,760
if you

860
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,679
if you prefer otherwise

861
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,840
hey pascal

862
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,559
um thunder rolling id

863
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,230
so um is this

864
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,200
[Music]

865
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,480
so um

866
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,279
i i think referring to another document

867
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,600
for terminology

868
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
versus redefining is the right thing to

869
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,559
do

870
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,480
right we don't want to define

871
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,320
the same thing in many places and then

872
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,720
have the definitions maybe not

873
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
be in sync or you know etc so that's a

874
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
good thing

875
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
um don't worry about the reference and

876
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,720
if there's a

877
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,240
downrive or not

878
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,080
um first of all knowing that it's an

879
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
architectural document i'm sure that

880
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
it will get referenced later by some

881
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
other things as well

882
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
so yeah that shouldn't be a problem

883
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,919
um and i'm going to say don't worry

884
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,519
about the sequencing either

885
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
thinking that the raw architecture is a

886
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
little bit behind

887
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,919
because in any case my publication queue

888
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,360
is relatively deep

889
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,559
so by the time i get to this uh you know

890
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,320
we won't have to worry about it anymore

891
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
yes

892
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,960
okay

893
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
that's good

894
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,640
and if if for some reason we completely

895
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,120
abort row then i change that obviously

896
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
but i i mean the architecture is on the

897
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
right track so i'm not just to let you

898
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,159
know that it will it will

899
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,280
it may

900
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,918
hold this one that depends on

901
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,760
the different cues i mean john's versus

902
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,399
servers

903
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,918
okay and that's pretty much it for me

904
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,918
okay very good so

905
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,520
um

906
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,320
so ready for pr i will publish 28 and

907
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,839
then you press the button that's that's

908
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,520
the deal

909
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,839
and that's the deal unless i hear a

910
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,000
strong objection here in the room or in

911
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,639
the mailing list in the coming days but

912
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,119
okay so we do that

913
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,960
at the end at the end of this week

914
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,719
depending on the mailing list activity

915
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,199
if nothing wrong shows up

916
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,800
i'll publish because after that i'm in

917
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,560
pto so i'll i'll publish 28 and then cry

918
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
okay thank you so much

919
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,240
thank you and you're back again

920
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,439
for the next presentation

921
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,520
okay

922
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,000
let's go did you just disappear

923
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,680
i'm trying to pass you the control again

924
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,480
oh ho ho ho

925
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,359
okay so um

926
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,320
well i mean i'm lost why do you pass me

927
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,640
uh aren't you talking about uh six law

928
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,720
registration

929
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,359
oh oh sorry agenda

930
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,960
yeah yeah

931
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
i forgot that that was that i'm sorry

932
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
you just

933
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
so we convinced 20 people in a room just

934
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,880
for you

935
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,040
okay

936
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,400
so yeah this is this is a work which is

937
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,720
let me start the video again just be a

938
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,839
little bit polite

939
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,480
um yes there we go so this is a work

940
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,520
which started at six low but really the

941
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,359
way it's written right now it impacts

942
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,720
six low six man and raw

943
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,599
and the reason for that is we wanted to

944
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,200
to give a complete story across

945
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,720
work groups

946
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,920
and that's kind of based upon

947
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
some other histories

948
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,079
for instance the sixth opponent versus

949
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,680
report stories

950
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,079
which has been bouncing back back and

951
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,680
forth between

952
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
six low and raw

953
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,560
um you know we did

954
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,880
rc8505 and then we did rc 9010

955
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,880
again

956
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,119
to make something like that work

957
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,240
you have to think in advance in ed 505

958
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,119
everything that 9010 will need

959
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,359
and obviously when you write 9010 you

960
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,119
realize that oops you should have done

961
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,920
this in 9545 or something

962
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
so so

963
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
if we want a consistent story and and

964
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
as we build it we might impact nd and we

965
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
might think by triple

966
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
so so this time we try not to make the

967
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
same mistake and say oh let's build the

968
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
full story and and write the right

969
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,240
impacts on the sixth side and the right

970
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,119
impacts on the wrong side

971
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,920
so next next slides me

972
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
so that's why we ended up with this

973
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
single

974
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,800
document the document showed up at six

975
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
low because it starts with what you

976
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,240
register

977
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,760
in this case we are talking about

978
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,520
extending eight five four five for any

979
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,240
cast and multicast registration

980
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
and why are we doing this we are doing

981
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
this because we got some users which

982
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
came to us and

983
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,280
came to the atf effectively and said hey

984
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
um

985
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
we we we're good for nd we live without

986
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,440
multicast and that's really great

987
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,280
but we still need multicast and for

988
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,040
multicast we have the same prime as we

989
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,000
had with nd right so the the report

990
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,520
creates a pool a multicast pool by the

991
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,640
router

992
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
which is exactly the model that you

993
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,680
don't want in an iot network

994
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
because it means that the devices has to

995
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,720
have to be awake waiting for this pool

996
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,880
and reply even if there is nothing

997
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
interesting to it report

998
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,040
the devices prefer to sleep on their own

999
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,160
schedule and tell the router when they

1000
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,680
like

1001
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,200
and guess what they already have a 545

1002
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,520
to report that they have an address a

1003
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,680
unicast address

1004
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,320
why don't we extend 505 to report that

1005
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,240
you're interested in listening to a

1006
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,480
multicast address or if you're

1007
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
participating in any guest address so

1008
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
basically that's what we did with this

1009
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,480
this document we said hey

1010
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,599
the nodes

1011
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,800
already don't need mld for nd right a

1012
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,839
six open nd does not rely on mld

1013
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,320
now there will be no mld at all even for

1014
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
multicast you can register to your

1015
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
router and the router will do what's

1016
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
necessary

1017
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,480
so we we have the same benefits as we

1018
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,760
already have with h505 we have a

1019
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
basically a host to router interface

1020
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
which is completely abstract to how the

1021
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,359
router

1022
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,440
routes or now does multicast

1023
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,400
so

1024
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
um that was that was where we started

1025
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
from but then we said hey by the way uh

1026
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,880
what is the multicast for this oh it

1027
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,720
could be meepo and that's what weissan

1028
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,599
is doing but most of the time people are

1029
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,839
using non-storing mode and guess what we

1030
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,960
have multicast only in storing mode

1031
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,599
so we said hey let's provide the

1032
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,359
multicast that goes with it for

1033
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,960
non-storing

1034
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,440
and the very cool thing is we had all

1035
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,560
the tools in our toolbox for doing this

1036
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,079
because with rfc 9010 the reaper and

1037
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,280
aware leaves

1038
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,119
we already know how to build tunnels

1039
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,280
from the root to the router that serves

1040
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,119
the device

1041
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,200
so typically a device that doesn't want

1042
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,599
to do mld is a low power device that

1043
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,760
doesn't want to do ripple either

1044
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,319
so it will do it 505

1045
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,000
it will be seen as an external

1046
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
destination

1047
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
and then it there will be a tunnel to

1048
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,000
the router for him

1049
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
so

1050
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,359
for non-storing mode multicast why don't

1051
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,640
we leverage this tunnel

1052
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,280
and so we said hey

1053
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
basically the multicast addresses are

1054
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,079
registered using non-storing mode

1055
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,160
but basically the way it

1056
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,440
percolates

1057
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
will be

1058
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,680
very close to to the way we do unicast

1059
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,280
with only one thing

1060
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
the tid

1061
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,359
will be omitted that will that won't be

1062
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,599
considered that's gonna be next slide

1063
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
because multiple sources can can ask the

1064
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,040
same thing

1065
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
and the the root will do ingress

1066
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,560
replication

1067
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
so there is no multicast tree inside the

1068
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,599
non-storing ripple there is just

1069
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,400
a

1070
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,760
set of tunnels between the root

1071
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,599
and the routers which serve the final

1072
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,119
destinations

1073
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
and so we we added this into into this

1074
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
document and we called it mod5 so that

1075
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
was the discussion on on odv repo with

1076
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,119
map five

1077
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,440
and we agreed that aodv repo is map four

1078
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,359
so we can beam up five

1079
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,720
so it's still question mark but

1080
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,880
basically we we are there

1081
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,599
so we have new flags in the arrow and

1082
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,640
those flags are propagated in the dow

1083
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,520
so now that that's basically consistent

1084
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,920
the changes we do in the arrow and the

1085
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
changes within in the dial

1086
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,839
so that's the the cool thing about

1087
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,960
having a single document

1088
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
and so

1089
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,440
we pushed it three times since last iatf

1090
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,599
mostly clarification again right it was

1091
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,079
clarification but we we wanted to be

1092
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,839
quick with this document because there

1093
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,920
is a huge need on the weisen side so we

1094
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,520
really worked on it and i got the why

1095
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,720
some guys to do reviews for us as well

1096
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
um

1097
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,280
so we clarified that it's not an a2mld

1098
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
where the device pushes that he listens

1099
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,880
to an address as opposed to to getting a

1100
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,440
pull by the router we clarified that the

1101
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,160
tid freshness assertion is not done

1102
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,560
because there will be multiple devices

1103
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
not synchronized that will do the same

1104
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
request for the same multicast or any

1105
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,520
cast address so ripple should not decide

1106
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
that the only good ones are the freshest

1107
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
based on tid because the tid won't be

1108
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,839
synchronized so it's not a unicast

1109
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,839
moving for which the the tid is

1110
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
meaningful it's just multiple

1111
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
richest registration for the same

1112
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,040
address

1113
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,000
so don't use tid

1114
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,079
now the most interesting thing that

1115
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,760
happened recently

1116
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,920
is this question that we did not really

1117
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,880
solve in 9505 which is what happens if

1118
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
the router reboots

1119
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,920
and basically how do we does the 6ln

1120
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,960
know

1121
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,599
that it needs to refresh the state in

1122
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,920
the router because until then you won't

1123
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,640
get any packet

1124
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,680
so what we did is

1125
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,560
we created a new ro status which is

1126
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,960
registration refresh request

1127
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,319
that the router can sound

1128
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
in an asynchronous n a which already

1129
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,079
exists in a 545 but this status is new

1130
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,200
and the asynchronous na can be unicast

1131
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,839
or multicast so for instance if if the

1132
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,040
router gets a packet from a 1600 that it

1133
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
doesn't know

1134
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
it's not a normal situation because you

1135
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,520
need to register to your router before

1136
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,119
you use them i mean for

1137
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
savvy or stuff like that

1138
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
so the writer should know about you if

1139
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,200
you start sending him a packet it

1140
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,160
doesn't know your address he he may send

1141
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,240
this new error status

1142
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,040
um

1143
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,680
it can also be an essence multicast in

1144
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,240
the case of ysun for instance they have

1145
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,960
effectively a multicast channel it's

1146
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,839
slow it's periodic but they have a time

1147
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,680
where the devices are synchronized and

1148
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,160
will listen to a multicast so the router

1149
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,680
will have an opportunity to send a

1150
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,319
multicast

1151
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
with a narrow status registration

1152
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,920
refresh request after it reboots you can

1153
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,400
do it once try twice three times

1154
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,920
and you know getting a chance for the

1155
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,680
six elements to discover that that's

1156
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,160
rebooted

1157
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
um now it's not the only way that we

1158
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,760
propose and that's going to be next

1159
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,800
slide

1160
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,440
and by the way i i had an early

1161
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
discussion with amanda

1162
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,040
on the ins section so i've revisited the

1163
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,880
inr to to

1164
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,720
fit better with the model that she

1165
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
expects

1166
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,079
basically the the

1167
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,920
we used to call things subregistries and

1168
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,440
registries wasn't clear what was a

1169
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,359
registry and sub-registry there is no

1170
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,720
sub-registry

1171
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,880
so so all the tables individual tables

1172
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
now are registries

1173
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,400
and

1174
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
the the basically the web page which

1175
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,520
aggregates the number of registries

1176
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,079
now is is kind of a registry group or

1177
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,160
you can say it's under the name blah of

1178
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,720
the page but the page itself is not a

1179
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,680
registry it's a group or just a page the

1180
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
registries or the things inside so i

1181
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
rewarded things

1182
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,839
in here and in dow projection document

1183
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,440
as well

1184
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,839
and you'll see that in 28 but

1185
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,319
it's all now fitting the way amanda

1186
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,680
wants it

1187
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,480
so so this this item i just said is next

1188
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
slide let's go to it

1189
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,400
so the second thing that the router

1190
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,960
could do when it reboots is effectively

1191
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,280
sent in a second array

1192
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,920
now sadly this does not exist at six men

1193
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,200
and that's the reason why i'm saying

1194
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,839
this document in fact six men alvaro

1195
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,880
again this one is one that could deserve

1196
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
your attention

1197
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,359
so so you know that when you want to

1198
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,640
have a new

1199
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,280
option in rme sages

1200
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
you need to to

1201
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,799
get the documents through six men

1202
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,680
and so we had the discussion at six law

1203
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,040
yesterday

1204
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,880
uh what we do with this option and there

1205
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,560
are two things we can do we can take the

1206
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,640
text out of this document and publish

1207
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,560
without it

1208
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,680
or

1209
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
we can

1210
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,079
get the documents through six man to say

1211
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,319
to get our approval and the recline

1212
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,359
yesterday was more into let's make it a

1213
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,079
separate document

1214
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,920
which means that

1215
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,960
either we we of block this document to

1216
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,760
make the other one a normative reference

1217
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,040
or

1218
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,960
we live without it

1219
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,640
and when we publish the other one we say

1220
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
oh by the way

1221
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,839
we extend this one

1222
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,520
with you know as a potential user of

1223
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,280
this option

1224
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,599
and basically what the option is is just

1225
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,400
the

1226
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,880
time that the router has been awake

1227
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,520
so so if you register at 5 pm and the

1228
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,000
router at night 6 pm and the router says

1229
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,920
have been up for 30 minutes

1230
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,160
you realize that you know the router has

1231
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
lost your stay

1232
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,560
and so you can re-register whatever so

1233
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,800
it applies to 8505 it applies to this

1234
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,400
and it would apply to anything that

1235
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,000
anyone is doing with the rotter and the

1236
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
rata's reboot

1237
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,720
so eric kind of agreed that it was of

1238
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,559
general

1239
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,160
usefulness

1240
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,480
and so it was it was more into

1241
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,960
let's make it its own draft

1242
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,520
so that's where we were and so basically

1243
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,240
eric has a task to

1244
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,559
to discuss it with uh

1245
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,599
the other ids you know basically you

1246
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,720
and

1247
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,160
eric wink

1248
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,480
for six man and probably the six-man

1249
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,920
chairs as well

1250
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,160
and you know come back to me and whether

1251
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
i should take that

1252
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,000
particular option and it's processing

1253
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,760
out of this document make it a separate

1254
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,839
document

1255
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,640
so

1256
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,040
it's for me it's either way is okay

1257
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
we can live without the array option

1258
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,559
because we have dna so we still have a

1259
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,480
solution

1260
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,319
uh

1261
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,200
it's good to have the array the toolbox

1262
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
adding it later

1263
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,559
the only problem i have is is the

1264
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,079
implementers of this rfc might not

1265
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,760
implement the array and when we publish

1266
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
the array they won't even care or know

1267
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,280
that it's there

1268
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,680
so so that's

1269
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,040
they will have to leave probably with

1270
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
dna that's the only problem

1271
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,960
unless like i said we make the other

1272
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
document a normative ref but i don't

1273
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,319
know how long it takes to take the other

1274
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,559
documents through through six man that

1275
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,240
will delay this rfc quite a bit

1276
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,480
now

1277
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,920
going through six man having its own

1278
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,839
document i guess we'll have a much

1279
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,480
better result because six man will

1280
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,319
hopefully pass it but they will message

1281
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,599
it make it more useful hopefully

1282
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,200
so that's where we are so so don't be

1283
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,800
surprised although if you if you see

1284
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,720
rick coming to you and

1285
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,319
and asking you know

1286
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,680
how we proceed with this thing

1287
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,839
i made sense

1288
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,880
hey um i love her though

1289
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,000
yeah i didn't know if you wanted me to

1290
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,079
say something uh yes it makes sense to

1291
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,960
me um okay and uh i'm neither six eleven

1292
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,440
or six man or my working group so

1293
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,200
uh yes i'm fine with this

1294
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,040
when you're finished i do have a couple

1295
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,880
of other questions for you but

1296
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
i'm done i'm done sorry go ahead

1297
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,280
okay so um what is the status

1298
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
of this in six law

1299
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
oh we are done i mean the the

1300
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,880
expectation that what was discussed at

1301
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
six low was

1302
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,839
to

1303
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,520
trigger uh

1304
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,359
work group last goal

1305
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,520
and i guess the chairs maybe i we should

1306
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,160
leave dominica i guess discuss this

1307
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,599
right because you already agreed with

1308
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,760
them i guess munich

1309
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,720
so i will leave you yes we did

1310
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,800
so we'll issue working group let's call

1311
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,400
synchronously between the two working

1312
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,920
groups and sixth law stays at the home

1313
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,160
for this document but we're working

1314
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,558
together

1315
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,119
perfect that works perfect for me uh the

1316
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,960
reason i was asking

1317
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,160
was was not that but um

1318
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,240
was because of the relationship with pim

1319
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,880
and i know that i had asked that we

1320
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
discussed this in pim i know that he

1321
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,400
sent an email

1322
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
uh to the print working group

1323
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,440
i refreshed the email a month or so ago

1324
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,520
to see if you know there was something

1325
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,599
and and there was nothing

1326
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,960
yeah and

1327
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,400
i'm actually that's that's thank you

1328
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,119
alvaro for bringing that up uh tim also

1329
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,040
mentioned that yesterday

1330
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,520
and the answer timothy winters and and

1331
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,480
the the the answer i made to him was

1332
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,359
like we are not really doing multicast

1333
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,200
we are doing grass replication um

1334
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,240
is that um

1335
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,000
pim does other things besides pim the

1336
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,200
protocol

1337
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
uh like mld

1338
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,240
which is

1339
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,200
something that you're placing here and

1340
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,800
the pim working group right now is

1341
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,000
working on moving mld

1342
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,960
to be an internet standard

1343
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,920
so it would be nice for them to consider

1344
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,880
if there's other work needed

1345
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,800
if the signaling

1346
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,559
doesn't come through mld

1347
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,160
but the signaling comes through the

1348
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
mechanism you're specifying here

1349
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,240
so i'm gonna um

1350
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,760
so that you're not surprised when people

1351
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,960
come running behind you i'm going to go

1352
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,160
talk to the pip chairs because i think

1353
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,440
this is important that the working group

1354
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,640
discuss

1355
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,880
that at least that we get something

1356
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,559
at least that we get

1357
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,720
no problem type

1358
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,000
response from them but but i would

1359
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,880
really like to see a response

1360
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,640
because there's a lot of processes that

1361
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,720
are dependent on

1362
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
as you mentioned in the draft mld

1363
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,119
snooping and you know some other stuff

1364
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,680
that would have to change so if a host

1365
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,040
now starts using the signaling

1366
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,960
in a network that would otherwise be

1367
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,160
using mlv

1368
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,200
you know someone has to do something

1369
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,160
different

1370
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,240
so just so that they're at least aware

1371
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,319
that we get some positive feedback from

1372
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,160
them that that someone read the draft

1373
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,319
and that yeah

1374
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,640
that's neat alvaro i really appreciate

1375
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,920
it um

1376
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,079
the the way i i

1377
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,839
i would like uh

1378
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,079
what i'm mostly interested in on my side

1379
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:44,960
is

1380
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,000
whether um there is something we would

1381
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,760
need to add

1382
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,160
in our spec here

1383
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,760
uh because basically the the whole the

1384
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,160
whole thing about 545 the philosophy

1385
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,440
behind it

1386
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,720
is we have an agnostic way for the host

1387
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,400
to talk to the router

1388
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,480
what the router will do with that if it

1389
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,960
does ripple if it doesn't deproxy if it

1390
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,160
does rift if it does a vpn

1391
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,960
we don't care that's the router business

1392
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,440
but it's important that the host always

1393
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,760
provides everything that's needed and

1394
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,720
that the router cannot infer by himself

1395
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,119
that's why the arrow has the sequence

1396
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,119
counter because when you move the

1397
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,559
routers cannot know what's the most

1398
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,319
recent location you have to provide it

1399
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,280
to them

1400
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,440
so so the sequence counter the proof of

1401
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,359
ownership those things the router cannot

1402
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,559
infer

1403
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,079
but

1404
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,599
everything else like

1405
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,680
deciding to inject it and how to inject

1406
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,599
it cetera long as you know

1407
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,200
so if if mld needs because the router

1408
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,160
could

1409
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,920
today what we do with this pack is we

1410
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,640
say hey if you if you have non-storing

1411
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,119
you can use this new mob 5.

1412
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,040
we also say if we have nipple you can

1413
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
use meepo

1414
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,359
but

1415
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,480
what else

1416
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,319
just like at 505 the else could be

1417
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,520
anything

1418
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,240
but is there a case something

1419
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,920
that mld would like to to to get from

1420
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,200
the host

1421
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,839
so that the router can proxy mld on

1422
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,680
behalf of the device

1423
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,440
right and you know i think that as as

1424
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,760
we've talked about before uh 8505 and

1425
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,599
even the extension that you mentioned to

1426
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,280
this about restarting

1427
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
have broader applicability

1428
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
and so it's not only going to be in

1429
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,280
networks where ripple is running it may

1430
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,880
be in the network exactly

1431
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,440
i want to get from from the pim guys

1432
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,680
and at least again so they're aware

1433
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,040
so that if

1434
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,119
other work not just in the spec but

1435
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,160
other work

1436
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,240
that they might need to do

1437
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,240
that's fantastic i really appreciate

1438
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,480
that okay so i'll uh it's too bad that

1439
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,520
the pym

1440
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,200
meeting was this morning

1441
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,000
but

1442
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,480
i'll have mike and stigg

1443
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,559
chase it down at some point

1444
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,160
and and try and have some discussion

1445
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,520
with the pin working group that you know

1446
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,200
they push them to actually

1447
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,040
say something well if if someone could

1448
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,599
contribute to the worker plus call

1449
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,119
and a supplement saying oh you know i'm

1450
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,920
good but i'm i mean uh if if you know he

1451
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,319
comes and say please add this flag to

1452
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,880
the to the arrow because we need it or

1453
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,720
this field we have an opaque field where

1454
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,880
we can put one bite by the way so if

1455
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,559
there is something like that that they

1456
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,480
might like us to do

1457
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,640
i mean it's perfect time to it doesn't

1458
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,319
change the philosophy or anything big

1459
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,079
right but it could be you know what they

1460
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,040
want

1461
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,559
right thanks

1462
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,040
oh thank you

1463
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,920
and that's that's it for me

1464
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,880
thank you very much there is a question

1465
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,640
there is a question pascal in the chat

1466
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,920
can we draw for all

1467
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,799
type of address registrations and then

1468
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,680
the second question will be that uh

1469
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,558
sorry i'm traveling

1470
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,680
oh that's a great question

1471
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
so

1472
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,559
we

1473
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,799
so the tid is normally a sequence

1474
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,760
counter what it normally does in ripple

1475
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,760
yeah in the arrow but then it passed in

1476
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,400
ripple as the path sequence

1477
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,640
is if you move and you send a dial then

1478
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,480
you know you compare the sequence of the

1479
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,160
different dials that you have and the

1480
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,000
most recent sequence comes from the

1481
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,400
latest location of the device so every

1482
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,079
route that you would have for an older

1483
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,400
sequence has to be invalidated

1484
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,200
this is basically traditional ripple

1485
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,760
now it was not said enough

1486
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,520
in the ripple multicast support in 6550

1487
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,240
which is only story mode it was not said

1488
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,040
enough that the tid does not apply

1489
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,359
to multicast because if multiple people

1490
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,599
register to the same address i mean they

1491
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,440
don't know what tid the other guys are

1492
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,920
using they all want the multicast

1493
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,400
so it's not the tid was meant to keep

1494
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,880
only one route only the most recent for

1495
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,359
unicast moving for any cast you want to

1496
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,880
keep them all

1497
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,680
so basically the only way to retract the

1498
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,920
multicast route is to time it out to let

1499
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,079
the lifetime time out

1500
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,880
and the tid cannot be used to say oh

1501
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,640
this one is absolute because it has an

1502
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,640
order tid

1503
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,280
now for the rover

1504
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,559
the rover

1505
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,400
um is

1506
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,040
normally a proof of ownership

1507
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,200
and then again

1508
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,240
we will

1509
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,920
need

1510
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,920
to do something like 8 9 28

1511
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,680
if we want to exploit rovers for

1512
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,040
multicast

1513
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,520
what is what i take from your command is

1514
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,400
i should probably say in this document

1515
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,960
as far as this document is concerned

1516
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,640
there is no owner of the multicast

1517
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,559
address so you don't use the rover just

1518
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,000
the same way you don't use the tid

1519
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,520
now in the future we may have a spec

1520
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,559
which synchronizes the rover values

1521
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,960
and synchronizes the tids between the

1522
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,280
different requesters in which case the

1523
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,440
rover would would have effectively a

1524
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,640
significance

1525
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,400
but for now i guess

1526
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
i need as i take as a workplace call

1527
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,119
command that i have to say what i say to

1528
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,880
about the tid i would say about the

1529
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,200
rover since they are not expected to be

1530
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,760
synchronized there can not be one value

1531
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,480
of the rover for this multicast group

1532
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,160
at this with this specification we have

1533
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,960
no way to to to force everyone to have

1534
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,040
the same rover

1535
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,359
okay so and then was that your question

1536
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,359
yes for the kid yes i know what you said

1537
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,160
but

1538
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,520
i just want to know that you are

1539
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,920
removing the kid in future

1540
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,520
specifications

1541
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,400
oh no no no no the tid is very important

1542
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,559
the tid is important but only for

1543
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,400
unicast routes

1544
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,040
because it allows you to figure

1545
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,799
where the well you know that and then

1546
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,359
but it allows you to tell us the the

1547
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,119
router the rotting to know

1548
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,799
the freshness yeah most recent okay

1549
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,480
i was thinking about the um

1550
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,240

and then

1553
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,559
uh it's okay it's okay from my side if i

1554
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,480
i let me think but if i have some

1555
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880

1556
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,440

1558
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,880
a note to to say oh tid but also rover

1559
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,440

give you another one purposefully

1622
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,000
