1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
for being here

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
we have a short introduction before

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,559
starting the actual

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,599
meeting

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,200
so bear with me for for the following

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
slide

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
they're not well so i think most of you

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
are too well aware of that but this is

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,119
uh the rtf follows the

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,039
etf intellectual property right

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,039
disclosure rules and uh so by

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,880
participating in the iota if you agree

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,119
to follow the rtf processes and policies

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,880
that are listed here and if we invite

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
you to have a close look at this

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
recommendation and the definitive

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,399
information

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
provided here

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
for the audio and video recording so the

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
iftf routinely makes recordings of

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
online and in-person meetings including

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
audio video and photographs and

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
publishes those recording online

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
if you participate in person and not

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
choose to wear a red do not photograph

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
linear then you can send to appear in

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
those groups in search recordings and if

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,039
you speak at a microphone appear on a

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,879
panel or carry out an official duty as a

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
member of irtf leadership then you can

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
send to appearing in recordings of you

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
at the time

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
if you participate online and turn on

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,119
your camera and all your microphone then

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,720
you can send to appear in search record

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
for the privacy and code of conduct

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
as a participant in or attendee to any

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
irtf activity you acknowledge that

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
region audio video and photographic

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
records of meetings may be made public

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
and the information personal information

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
you provide will be also handled

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
according to the privacy policy that you

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,799
can find references here in this slide

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
a short statement on the goals of the

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,520
rtf

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
so the irtf conducts research it is not

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
a standards development organization

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
the internet research task focuses on

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,759
long-term research issues related to the

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,680
internet while the parallel organization

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
the ietf focuses on short-term issues of

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,799
engineering and standards making

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
and while the iltf can publish

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,479
informational and experimental documents

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,360
in the rfc series its primary goal

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
is to promote the development of

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
research collaboration

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
teamwork in exploring research issues

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
related to internet protocols

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,599
application architecture and

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,200
technologies

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
and you can get more information about

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
the goals and missions of the ietf in

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,200
the uh an rhf primer for ietf

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
participants never seen

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
the online meeting etiquette so this

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
session is being recorded please keep

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
your audio muted and video off when

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
presenting or speaking and when speaking

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
please start by stating your name

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
a few useful links you can also find

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
that on the

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
ietf meeting agenda so the links to the

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,000
materials the meteor sessions and the

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,879
meeting notes

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,360
so for today we have a very dense agenda

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
we have two hours meeting but we have a

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
lot of topics to cover so

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,720
our first

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
request will be for presenters please

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
stick to the time allocated

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,519
not more we would like to have time for

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
question answers so bear in mind also

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
when you're presenting to keep time in

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
your presentation to address questions

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,519
that you will have

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
so do not use all your slot just for

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
presenting your slides

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
so we will start with this current

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,959
introduction and research group status

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
then we will have a guest presentation

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
and a number of topics on network

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
digital twin

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,959
green networking artificial intelligence

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,519
and newton-based networking

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
i'm not go through the details because

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
we want to save a bit of time here

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
just a quick status on some activities

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
of the research group so we have

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
research group documents in the pipe we

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
have two documents that are raised the

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,280
rfc editor currently in the edit stage

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
so the editor urs editor is looking into

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
those documents and we expect to get

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
some feedback soon on the next step

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
we have one active research group

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
document digital tree network concept

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,120
and reference architecture and we will

110
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
have an update on the progress of this

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,799
draft in this session

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,519
and

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,879
there are also

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
another document network measurement

115
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
intent one of ibn use cases that has

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
been in a first call for adoption and we

117
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,560
ask for revision addressing some

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
comments received to make a second call

119
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,519
for adoption and we will also have

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,040
updates on this document in this session

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
an outlook for future meeting but this

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,639
is a bit business as usual we will

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
organize uh some interim meetings or

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,360
follow-up discussion on the different

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
topics

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,639
we have one in the pipe that we try to

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
organize for some time on the design

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,479
deployment and operation of distributed

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
ai we have also some presentation today

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
about this topic but we would like to

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
offer a laser platform to address this

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
topic in a dedicated interview or

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
collocate with a research conference

134
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
uh we have a network digital twin site

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
meeting uh this evening

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
on ibm use cases so also we are open to

141

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
support of the future a

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
company that provided the award

175
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,240
at the

176
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
brazilian

177
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
congress of the competing society

178
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
and

179
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,080
yeah

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
[Music]

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
and for

182
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,319
denuciate or denounce

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,440
the

184
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
neglect that's occurring in brazil right

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,319
now

186
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
in science and research and education

187
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
so my presence here it's

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
not due to the

189
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
with the support of the brazilian

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
government so

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,919
well

192
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
we started talking about the paper

193
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,000
entitled using the rfc 7575 and models

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
at runtime for enabling autonomic

195
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
network in sdn

196
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
it was

197
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,599
unnowarded at the workshop pre-ietf last

198
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,479
year

199
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,280
it is part of my phd thesis

200
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
that i defended in 2020

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
by the

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
university federal university of

203
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,679
penabuco also in brazil

204
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
and i just present part of it if you

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
have want to see more details we can

206
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
discuss could discuss later this next

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,680
one

208
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,720
well before talking about the

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
paper itself

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,360
we need to

211
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
remember or to introduce you about the

212
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
concept involved in it the autonomic the

213
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
autonomic network management as may you

214
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,160
see may you know

215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
we have traditional management

216
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
in traditional network we have this

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
autonomous loop put

218
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
above the data plane where you need to

219
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
define the business goals we need to

220
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,959
define the knowledge generation we need

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
to define how the policy process will

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
occur

223
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,399
and also the information process

224
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
the thing is how can we

225
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
translate or to insert all of these

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
components all of this post-processing

227
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
the the business objectives and stuff

228
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
in the data plane

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
this architecture here it's not new it's

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
the 4k architecture based on strasner

231
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
it's from 2006

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,640
and it just defines how

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
this autonomic loop can be coupled with

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
the data plane

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,080
well when we consider the sdn network

236
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
the sdn architecture obviously these

237
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
business goals the policies the

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
knowledge generation the policy

239
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
processing

240
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,959
it now needs to communicate through the

241
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
control plane

242
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,040
and for communicating with the control

243
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
plane we need to translate these

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,920
business goals into network

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
rules excuse me can i

246
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,560
remove my mask

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
okay so

248
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,839
uh besides translating this policy

249
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,839
processing and the business goes we also

250
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,079
need to represent the context from the

251
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,560
network from the control plane uh to the

252
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
layer above to the autonomic loop above

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
so the question is how to enable

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
autonomous network in sdn in an sdn

255
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,839
architecture

256
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,079
well

257
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
it rises so many challenges as the

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
recent internet draft entitled the

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
research challenge and coupling

260
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
artificial intelligence and network

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
management of hiring

262
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,000
and

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,839
we can see several opportunities as well

264
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,360
okay

265
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
for introducing the rfc 7575 for those

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
who are not aware about it

267
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,519
it just defines some guidelines and it's

268
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
like a reference model if you want to

269
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
achieve an autonomic management in

270
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
networks not in sdn you can follow these

271
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
guidelines to

272
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
achieve designing goals to

273
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
to try to implement your autonomic

274
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
management in your network

275
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
so it defines

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
four surface star properties

277
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
like the

278
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
self configuration self healing self

279
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
protection and optimizing

280
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
besides it also defines 11 design goals

281
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
so if you want to provide your full

282
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,440
cycle of autonomous management you need

283
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
to implement

284
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
or achieve each of these goals and

285
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
following these proprietors

286
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
so okay we have the concept of autonomic

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,639
networking we have the rfc guiding

288
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
anyone who wants to implement them

289
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
implement it and the question again is

290
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
how to enable autonomous networking in

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
sdn we have some guidelines we have the

292
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
the concept of autonomic networking but

293
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
how to implement it how we enjoy this

294
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
two areas to different areas together

295
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
we know that atomic networking is not a

296
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
new area

297
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
the first research papers comes from the

298
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
2000 here

299
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,399
and we know now that the control plane

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
is softer

301
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
and we also know that

302
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
there are related areas in

303
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,279
computing like software engineering that

304
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,480
can

305
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,399
provide some

306
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
specific concepts about autonomic

307
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
software

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,560
so if you have this autonomic software

309
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
if you have this autonomic software you

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
will have the

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
um concept named from the software

312
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
engineer you have the

313
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
model that runtime concept

314
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,920
the people from all the related areas

315
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,720
provided a concept that may help us to

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,639
to think about or to have some

317
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
not so new ideas but

318
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
related ideas to how to implement our

319
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
autonomic networking management we're

320
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
using the control plane as software

321
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,279
okay so this is the concept the black

322
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,800
cycle here

323
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
modus at runtime that we are using in

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
our approach in our proposal to

325
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
demonstrate how this

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
combination between the rfc 7575 and the

327
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,079
autonomic network management concept can

328
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,800
be

329
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
combined together to provide

330
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
such a certain approach

331
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,040
obviously the iet apps community also

332
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,399
made these several

333
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
contributions

334
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
into the

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
autonomic field

336
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
excellent

337
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,720
so

338
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
continually

339
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
continually checking or observing all

340
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,639
the related areas like the software

341
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,880
engineering community community

342
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
we have class diagrams we have uml we

343
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,680
have sequence diagrams if you look for

344
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
the database area we have

345
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
the entity relationship diagram we have

346
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
uml so

347
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
in machine learning as well we also have

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,399
models

349
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,720
abstracting the complexity below and

350
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
providing some high-level models for the

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
users and developers to evolve the

352
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,199
solutions to discuss the solutions with

353
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
for example in software engineer you can

354
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
discuss your solutions with clients with

355
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
developers stakeholders and so on

356
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
in networking we can have topologies we

357
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
have a egg model but

358
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,760
is it easy to realize the models

359
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
how can we define intents in there using

360
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
them

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,399
how to create the correctness between

362
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
these models to check if there is no in

363
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
constants between the

364
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
the large cube

365
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,839
the large of the software that you're

366
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,600
trying to to implement

367
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
and obviously how can we use

368
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
young or net conf to

369
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,519
to enable zero or one thought with or

370
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
without human

371
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,480
touch in the from these models

372
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
so we now need to introduce the main

373
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
concept that is in the core of our

374
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,399
proposal that is the models at runtime

375
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,760
it comes from the software engineering

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
community and

377
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,480
it's it defines that any system if it's

378
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,399
a network or a control plane running

379
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
some software it defines that any system

380
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
has goals has behavior and has a

381
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
structure

382
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,920
and if you are going to

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
give some going deep into each of each

384
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
of these parts of the system

385
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
you need to

386
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
visualize that it needs to monitor you

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,399
need to execute some action you need to

388
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
to analyze each action that you're

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
performing

390
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,240
in

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
we also need to separate or to organize

392
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,639
these systems in three layers

393
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,480
the objective layer

394
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
the configuration layer and the base

395
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
layer

396
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,440
so we have the concept how to visualize

397
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,240
any system to provide autonomic behavior

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
but how can we implement it in fact

399
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,560
we need to

400
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,399
according to asthma

401
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
an author that

402
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
research about models at runtime we need

403
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,560
to define metamodels at first because

404
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,639
it's using the for these metamodels if

405
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,000
you look for the

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
left picture of some

407
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
yellow boxes you need to define these

408
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
metamodels to provide them formalism for

409
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
your language for your modern language

410
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
you need to define how you can associate

411
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,839
each concept for example objectives and

412
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,959
actions and flows how are they connected

413
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,560
to each other

414
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,440
we also need to define a concrete and

415
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,240
synthetic syntax to

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
provide to the user or the network

417
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,399
operator and elements so he can

418
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,240
model his objectives and model his

419
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,720
network model his network capabilities

420
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,959
and so on

421
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,520
besides that we also need code templates

422
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,599
we need to have this code templates to

423
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,559
make

424
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
adaptation in the execution of the

425
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,760
system

426
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
you cannot just provide for the user

427
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
some interface some interface and the

428
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
user will try to program it directly if

429
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
you are trying to

430
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
model objectives you need to provide to

431
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
him some abstraction

432
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
and also we have

433
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
monitoring techniques and machine

434
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,760
learning algorithms

435
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
combine it together to

436
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
try to achieve the adaptations to try to

437
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
to execute or achieve the modality

438
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,159
objectives as well

439
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,679
so

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
in our proposal we

441
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,120
used the rfc 7575 as a north

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
and

443
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
we provided this three-layer

444
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,679
architecture

445
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,240
which is which is composed of the

446
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
network model layer at the above

447
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
we have the adaptability layer in the

448
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,080
middle and also and obviously we are

449
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
using the

450
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
sdn architecture at the infrastructure

451
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,880
layer

452
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
the network model here we have

453
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,679
five models we have the configuration

454
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
model of the network we have the

455
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,520
capabilities models and obsolete we have

456
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,919
the objectives model where the user or

457
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
the network operator can define his

458
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
objectives

459
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,678
in a high abstraction level

460
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,799
given some details about each of these

461
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,520
layers the first one the network model

462
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,400
here

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,520
we need to use the previously mentioned

464
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
metamodels we defined these metal models

465
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,559
for example here we are having at the

466
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
at the middle the metamodel for defining

467
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,320
the

468
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,520
objective model so we formalize how you

469
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,559
can

470
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,640
define the objectives how you can

471
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,799
associate these objectives with actions

472
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,200
in your network how you can associate

473
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
these actions with flows and so on

474
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,000
at your right side you're we are seeing

475
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
the metamodel for the applications and

476
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,960
for

477
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,559
the packets and the traffic that you

478
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,720
also can model in your

479
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,919
high level

480
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
tool

481
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,000
if you look for your left you have the

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
concrete syntax at above and you have

483
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,960
the

484
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
objectives models using the concrete

485
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,080
syntax so you need to understand this

486
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
two two things we have two metamodels

487
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,200
and we have two concrete syntax being

488
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,559
used in this slide here

489
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,039
next one

490
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,160
in the middle here we are using

491
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
a deep reinforcement learning algorithm

492
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,360
so it is using the information of the

493
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,559
models

494
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
from the objective layer as inputs

495
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
to this dr algorithm so the parameters

496
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
the network parameters the discount

497
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
factor that this drl algorithm is using

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
and they are being used from the

499
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
objectives layer

500
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
but it also is monitoring the network in

501
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
the infrastructure layer

502
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
um

503
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
it's

504
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
really important that we

505
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
see the

506
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,039
that the dr algorithm and all the code

507
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
are just generated from the high level

508
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
models you don't program it directly

509
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
the code of the drl algorithm are

510
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
generated from the above layer

511
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
so you can look for this layer and see

512
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that you have a knowledge base that

513
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
keeps learning according to the actions

514
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,320
executed at the network with the

515
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,120
decision that is randomly randomly

516
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
decided and executed by the algorithm

517
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
and

518
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
according to the execution of each

519
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
action it can

520
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
verify if

521
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
is the decisions being

522
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
more close to the modality objectives or

523
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,000
if the decisions that are being chosen

524
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
are

525
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,080
making the network parameters worse

526
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,919
compared to the

527
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,400
uh to the model to the objective to be

528
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,720
achieved

529
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,360
so the discussion to

530
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,559
bring to you is that as we have the

531
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
clear conceptual difference between

532
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,080
intent policies and service models

533
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
as the internet draft intent-based

534
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
network

535
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
concepts and definition

536
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
we can discuss if the proposed market

537
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,080
approach if this model

538
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
it's not at runtime approach is a

539
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
feasible way to implement these

540
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,799
abstractions in this concept

541
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,919
and if could the arc architecture

542
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
can have this new obstruction level

543
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
using these models to

544
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
create the the modeling then translated

545
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,400
these models into network code

546
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,039
and the last thing that i bring here to

547
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,320
discuss is that if or how intense uh

548
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,559
will be translated or translated into

549
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,520
network code or network rules

550
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,000
uh how they will be integrated with the

551
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
monitoring in the adaptation rules and

552
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,600
actions

553
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
so a mark-based definition a

554
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,679
market-based approach may help in this

555
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
case

556
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,159
okay concluding we just saw this

557
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,600
proposal from

558
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
enabling autonomic networking management

559
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
in sdn

560
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
we saw how the combination between

561
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,200
different different

562
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
areas of knowledge can be combined to

563
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
provide some new solution we also

564
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
see briefly um

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,120
high-level modelling modeling

566
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
architecture for implementing this

567
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,720
autonomic networking

568
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
and we just saw the distribution that

569
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
may occur

570
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
so

571
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,320
far that's it

572
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
well just to acknowledge the

573
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,799
uh supporters for

574
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
me that i'm being here today the future

575
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
way that is i provide the travel grant

576
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,760
the federal institute of lagos that

577
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
provided me the agenda to be here

578
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
and also the laboratory of data

579
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,159
engineering analysis where i do my

580
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,520
research thank you very much

581
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,840
we have time for questions or comments

582
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
okay so if there are no questions thank

583
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,640
you again felipe we can

584
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
okay

585
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
okay

586
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,320
i'm i'm sorry um developers

587
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
what i was wondering is precisely the

588
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,840
smart models how

589
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,159
complex would be to derive them from the

590
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
uh from the normal specs we have or from

591
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,039
the normal goals because you know

592
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
i have no doubt that this once you have

593
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
this in place it will be useful

594
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
the problem is how long it would take to

595
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,840
to have them in places in place when you

596
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,760
when you need to

597
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,960
monitor a service define a service or

598
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
what is your your experience or whether

599
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,279
you have any kind of metrics or

600
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,400
something like

601
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
about the process

602
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,360
okay if i understood you correctly are

603
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,919
you asking about the performance of this

604
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,640
no i'm talking about the learning curve

605
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
uh how much

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
for someone

607
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
let's say we now go on and try to define

608
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,919
a

609
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,320
service based on master b6 at this so in

610
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
fashion and

611
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
connecting several points and

612
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,679
how much would take to to to apply these

613
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,679
and make an analysis because at the end

614
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,760
if you have to derive this from

615
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,679
protocol by protocol it seems a little

616
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,799
bit

617
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,400
lengthy

618
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
i think i understand that well we as we

619
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
have like a

620
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,039
layer or a meta model that abstracts the

621
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
complexity we are not

622
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
um protocol oriented

623
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
we can generate the natural crew rules

624
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
for any protocol

625
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,600
so for example

626
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
you can model your objectives model okay

627
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
so after you model it it can generate

628
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,039
code for open flow it can generate code

629
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,120
for p4 you can generate code foreign

630
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
protocol

631
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
so it's

632
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,919
the the learning curve if you

633
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,120
i mentioned it

634
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,840
right

635
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,679
the learning group is just to know how

636
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
to to connect the boxes for for defining

637
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
what's your objective for example um if

638
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
you want but you need the metamodel

639
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
to start with right

640
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
the meta you don't need to create the

641
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
metamode actually the network operator

642
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
doesn't doesn't need to create the

643
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
metamodel he just used

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,240
he just needs to use the

645
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,279
the model above the concrete syntax it's

646
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,200
like a model language like a

647
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
uml or class diagram

648
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,480
but for having this class diagram

649
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
do you agree that you have a meta model

650
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
describing it right

651
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,840
okay so it's a model that has a

652
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
metamodel describing it so

653
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,039
the metamodel itself yes we need to

654
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,600
develop for each case like the the

655
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
objects that you need but after defining

656
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
it the network operator or the network

657
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
developer he just used he just needs to

658
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,039
use the concrete syntax like model

659
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,520
creating his class diagram if you were a

660
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,159
software engineer yeah

661
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
yeah okay okay i think i understand i

662
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
had to look in a little bit more detail

663
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
as well thank you thank you i engaged

664
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,799
invite you to maybe continue the

665
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
discussion offline after the session we

666
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
have a very tight agenda thank you

667
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,360
felipe i think there will be follow-up

668
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
discussion after the session thank you

669
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,678
thank you

670
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,200
our next speaker

671
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
will be shangsu for the concert and

672
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
reference architecture draft

673
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,320
hello cheers and everyone

674
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
yes we can hear you

675
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
okay uh this is shenzhou from china

676
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
mobile today i will present the draft

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,919
update of georgie network concept and

678
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,520
reference architecture

679
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,880
on behalf of our co-authors that's like

680
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
this

681
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
draft was adopted by the research group

682
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,960
in march this year and a major change in

683
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
this version is to add new sections of

684
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
enabling technologies to build digital

685
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,559
network

686
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,520
to reply the reviewer's comment

687
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,760
actually and including

688
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,840
data collection services network

689
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
modeling network visualization and

690
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
interfaces

691
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,559
the time slides will show the brief uh

692
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,320
info on the four enablers respectively

693
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,039
next slide please

694
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,960
okay the first enable is data question

695
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
and management guardian data collection

696
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,240
diversity diversified tools can be used

697
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,960
to

698
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
collect the various type of data

699
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,120
including lags tools of snp netconf

700
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,399
ipfix elementary int etc

701
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,760
and also some innovative tools like

702
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,039
sketch-based measurement if it is flow

703
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,840
information damage iom and

704
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
in-band flow learning etc

705
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,240
actually uh we have submitted a

706
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,720
dedicated new drops uh regarding data

707
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,080
collection i will give uh an intro

708
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
instruction later

709
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,919
for this management uh data warehouse

710
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,799
tech fast search batch data handling

711
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,960
conflict avoidance and unified interface

712
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
for data exchange should be studied

713
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,960
firstly that's like this

714
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,480
network modeling is the most important

715
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,720
in enabler to build digital network

716
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
this slide shows a brief summary and

717
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,520
compress in comparison for several major

718
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,799
modeling types

719
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
the first type is simulation or

720
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
emulation such as

721
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,480
s2 s3 opennet mininet uh uv e ng and uh

722
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,960
js

723
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,600
jls3

724
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
the second type is the

725
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,880
watchlight technologies using uh nfv

726
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
containers etc

727
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,559
microsoft

728
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,559
crossnet and arresters cloud vision

729
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,480
portal cvp are successful examples here

730
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,039
we know the first two types of module

731
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,200
measures are easy to deploy and suitable

732
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
for especially support for functional

733
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,679
and protocol event validation however

734
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,559
they have limitations of

735
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,760
including

736
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
high resource consumption for

737
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
performance analysis ability and poor

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,520
scalability

739
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,399
the

740
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,320
third type is modeling

741
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,039
using mathematical abstraction

742
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,320
here these three typical methods

743
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,520
include the full methods or formal

744
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,799
validation or verification theory

745
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,080
a series of both negative structure and

746
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,320
data-driven ai machine learning

747
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,919
algorithms

748
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
we know each type has some example

749
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,480
solutions at least in a table you can

750
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,360
see

751
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,559
and mathematical models are of low

752
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,840
resource cost

753
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,679
and faster

754
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,360
calculation and

755
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
suitable for especially super for

756
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
large-scale network

757
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,919
however

758
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
we think that how does have some

759
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,640
limitations on extensibility

760
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,679
and

761
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,200
the lack of

762
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,679
ability on functional and protocol

763
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,279
evaluation

764
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,159
specifically ai machine learning models

765
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,840
have low interpretability and also needs

766
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,480
a relatively expensive date for training

767
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
since each type of network modeling has

768
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
both pros and cons we believe that

769
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
multiple measures can be in combination

770
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,200
to build a comprehensive digital twin

771
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
network system

772
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,840
next slide please

773
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,918
among all methods

774
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,159
you will have to speed up and move to

775
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,279
the next slide into the next

776
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,080
presentation pretty soon please

777
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
okay uh

778
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,320
okay

779
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,399
among all master diction um um metal

780
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,720
modeling is a host homelessness

781
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,399
direction and this slide shows a digital

782
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,720
twin model easily from the drum

783
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
performance modeling of perspective

784
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,840
so for more details you can uh refer the

785
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
print of

786
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,840
print paper next slide please

787
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,559
okay for network visualization help your

788
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
visualization help users better

789
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
understand the internal structure of

790
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
network and minor valuable information

791
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
hidden in the network this slide lists

792
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,159
candidate techniques for network

793
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
topology visibility a modern

794
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,720
invisibility and interaction interaction

795
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,559
measures respectively

796
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,360
and that's like this

797
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
this slide shows the three types of

798
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
interfaces to build uh detail system

799
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,679
based on proposed architecture

800
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,039
all interfaces should be open and

801
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,760
standardized but specifically

802
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,640
no spawn interfaces should be extensible

803
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,799
and kind candid options can be restful

804
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,240
and the rest of

805
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
internal interfaces should be fast and

806
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,279
efficient

807
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,640
candidate options can be xmpp and http

808
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,519
3.

809
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
southbound interfaces should be light

810
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,000
weighted candidate options can be smg

811
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
and netcom

812
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
that slidepiece

813
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,559
okay in the future we will

814
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,559
dig deep on

815
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,760
each enabling technology and we'll

816
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
build a digital twin network system on

817
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,399
trial network and validate and the games

818
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,960
against specific use cases

819
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,279
we also work on proposals to enhance the

820
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,200
document

821
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
thank you

822
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
okay i suggest you go to the next

823
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,279
presentation right now and we will

824
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,960
address questions at the end of the slot

825
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
please

826
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,919
please please keep it concise in three

827
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
minutes the presentation

828
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,799
okay uh

829
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,919
uh uh this is uh here i will present the

830
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,760
soft updates on data collection and

831
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,519
requirements uh

832
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,760
uh

833
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,080
and uh uh requirement the data

834
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,600
requirements and technology for digital

835
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,799
to network

836
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,519
that's right please

837
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,919
the scope of the draft includes describe

838
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,200
described requirements and data

839
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
collection and for building digital team

840
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,240
networks

841
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
and to provide the data collection

842
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
method towarding uh

843
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,720
build digital twin uh data

844
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,679
uh defiant data repository the object of

845
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,840
job objective of this software includes

846
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,519
identifying the data collection

847
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,559
requirements and principles for dtm

848
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,639
and the coding for more efficient data

849
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,320
collection methods suitable for detail

850
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,639
system and the richer consensus on

851
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
selecting data collection method for

852
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,800
various natural data net slab piece

853
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,399
oh initially uh the draft was just a

854
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,440
specific clashing method for detail team

855
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
network now we promote the drop to to

856
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,800
extend the scope and to to general data

857
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,719
caching requirement and the message for

858
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,918
digital network is so insane so in this

859
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,280
version we

860
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
rescued the draft and we added sections

861
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,359
of data flash requirements of 4010 and

862
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,918
the refined text and made some auditory

863
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,040
changes

864
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
that's like this

865
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
okay uh this slide shows the content of

866
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,760
current job next

867
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,000
okay uh uh drop list

868
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
six data collection requirements so in

869
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
brief uh the process uh

870
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
the dedication should be target driven

871
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,040
and and on demand second is to use uh

872
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,839
diverse tools for various data

873
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,079
and essentially here we list some new

874
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
inertial directions of data works of

875
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,200
study further the third is requirement

876
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,320
is light weighted and efficient

877
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,440
depression and some detailed comments

878
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,040
leads here nice little piece

879
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
uh the fourth uh requirement is open and

880
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,520
standard in interfaces uh for data

881
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
collection and the fifth part is uh is

882
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,520
naming for caching

883
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,920
and the last comment is the efficient

884
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,400
market destination delivery

885
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
next nest slide piece

886
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,200
uh in this uh instructor we provide the

887
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
efficient efficient data collection

888
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,839
solution for digital network uh current

889
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,839
collection method mainly collect raw

890
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,520
date raw and fold it from physical

891
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,880
network and have problems of time cost

892
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,839
insufficient storage resources and local

893
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,680
computational efficiency risk of

894
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
bandwidth resources caused by data

895
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,359
transmission so this

896
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,960
propose an efficient uh and the

897
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,720
lightweight data flashing aggregation

898
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,440
the

899
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,960
correlation uh correlation uh method

900
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
first uh train network sends a structure

901
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,720
to physical network to collect data on

902
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
demand then physical network uh

903
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
completes instructions such as knowledge

904
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
equipment representation and the next

905
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,119
telemetry uh streams element pse of

906
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
physical network complex data

907
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,839
aggregation and correlation finally psg

908
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,160
sends a representation date to the tree

909
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,640
network is a shoot

910
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,078
procedure next slide please

911
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,119
this slide shows the detailed data

912
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,119
collection procedures on the of the

913
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,680
method you can refer that adopt drops

914
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,440
for more details let's place

915
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
okay uh going next or we will further

916
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,400
investigate and categorize the next date

917
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
collection map to us towards the wealth

918
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,800
data for building dtn system

919
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,440
and uh we'll verify that collection

920
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,720
method on dtm demo system and we will we

921
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
are coding for more efficient debt

922
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,520
collection method suitable for

923
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,920
digital team network system to enrich

924
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839

941
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,839
upc personal tech

942
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,880
and all representing this draft about

943
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
digital twin for network performance

944
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,640
this joint work with all these people

945
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,680
from

946
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,000
huawei and telephonic research next

947
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
please

948
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
next one sorry i have this

949
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
so well very briefly that because we

950
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,800
already normalized the concept of a

951
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,720
digital twin it's a virtual replica of a

952
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
physical system

953
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,640
and it

954
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,119
recreates with uh high five reality the

955
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,640
behavior of the the digital system like

956
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,440
the

957
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,760
example that most people use are i don't

958
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,040
know i want to

959
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,480
build a plane but i don't want to build

960
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,400
the plane so i

961
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,280
use a model to understand how

962
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
the wind will affect us some part of the

963
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,880
wing

964
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,839
um

965
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
and in our case we're proposing a

966
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,359
digital twin but only for network

967
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,240
performance so the input

968
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,480
of the digital twin are

969
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
a complete description of a network or

970
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
as complete as

971
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
as the user wants and output our

972
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,040
performance metrics

973
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,800
um

974
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,880
one more into detail uh when we refer to

975
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,640
different oh sorry

976
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,598
when we have um

977
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
the input we're thinking of

978
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,880
uh when i say complete description i

979
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
mean uh the topology routing

980
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
configuration if you want some specific

981
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
scheduling policies if you are using

982
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,880
some

983
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,839
if you need a specific traffic matrix

984
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,000
or

985
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,320
you have a specific flows or different

986
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,079
traffic models

987
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,960
and

988
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
the output right now we're targeting uh

989
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,760
three metrics so that is the delay data

990
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,359
and losses we think that these are

991
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,560
really important because are the ones

992
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,319
that are more widely used in network

993
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,319
management for example

994
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,920
in real-time applications you're always

995
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,119
interested in the the jitter of

996
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,319
voice call

997
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,200
or

998
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
in online gaming people always worry

999
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,560
about the delay that they have

1000
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
next please

1001
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
and in the draft we start talking about

1002
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
the requirements of this digital twin uh

1003
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,040
next please

1004
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
so the first

1005
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,640
requirement is that it should be fast

1006
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,880
next please

1007
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,520
uh because uh well we are also targeting

1008
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,359
optimization scenarios uh by network

1009
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,880
optimization we are thinking of these

1010
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
algorithms that explore

1011
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,720
a lot of different configurations until

1012
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,599
they

1013
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,240
find an optimal one or a configuration

1014
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
that satisfies a certain objective and

1015
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
if you want to run these algorithms in

1016
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,000
more or less real time or short time

1017
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
skills you need you need a model that is

1018
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,520
really fast

1019
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,200
of course a digital twin has four

1020
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
network performance

1021
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,440
also has to be fast i sorry accurate

1022
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,359
because you need a certain thing that

1023
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,319
the

1024
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,480
the performance will be within a

1025
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,119
predefined error range

1026
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,800
it also has to be scalable

1027
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
uh well because usually um production

1028
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,280
networks are much larger than any

1029
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
testbed that you can use to

1030
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,880
test how your model works

1031
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,720
and

1032
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,880
well exactly because of that

1033
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,760
um

1034
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,440
and as i said before the it should

1035
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,599
support a wide range of different

1036
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,240
network i

1037
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
different configurations or routing

1038
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
protocols scheduling policies

1039
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,440
and also different ranges of traffic

1040
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,680
intensity and finally it has to be

1041
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
accessible next please

1042
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,359
and by accessible i mean uh on one hand

1043
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,640
uh being able to communicate with

1044
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
existing systems so it needs a way to

1045
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,920
plug into an sdn controller or different

1046
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
control and management

1047
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,520
systems that are present in in current

1048
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
networks and it also has to produce

1049
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,280
metrics that are uh commonly used in

1050
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,680
network engineering so i for example is

1051
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,319
heading for delay or jitter and not you

1052
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,200
know

1053
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,359
some models for the produce some outputs

1054
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,040
that are not easy to understand for

1055
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,880
network engineers next please

1056
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,359
and in the draft we outline the the

1057
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,960
architectural interface of this digital

1058
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,040
twin next please

1059
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
and we are following the

1060
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
the architecture of the

1061
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,280
reference architecture of the

1062
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,079
digital twin concepts draft and well in

1063
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,280
actually you can see here now we have

1064
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,839
the physical network and we also that is

1065
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,599
connected to the management and control

1066
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,640
plane

1067
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,599
and

1068
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,160
and also the

1069
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
digital twin is connected to the

1070
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,160
management and control plane

1071
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,680
we have also outlined the interfaces

1072
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,200
here

1073
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,759
next please

1074
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,640
and

1075
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,400
well the configuration interface in the

1076
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,920
measurement interface we have seen

1077
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
previous drafts that talk about how to

1078
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,240
collect data we can also leverage uh

1079
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,200
widely used idf protocols like netcom or

1080
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,279
netflow for measurement next please

1081
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,920
and this administrator or this

1082
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,880
intent-based interface we i mean in our

1083
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,560
for our use case minimally it should

1084
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,839
just support

1085
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,440
running the digital twin defining some

1086
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
optimization objectives

1087
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,880
um

1088
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,200
uh applying some configuration but of

1089
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,720
course it can i mean it can range from a

1090
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,040
simple cli to a you know a

1091
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,400
state-of-the-art graphical user

1092
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,839
interface or even

1093
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,359
the

1094
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,920
this uh more modern

1095
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,119
intent-based

1096
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,119
networking that there are some drafts in

1097
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,760
the group also next please

1098
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,960
but the one that we're more interested

1099
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,800
in discussing here with the research

1100
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
group is the

1101
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,160
interface of the digital twin because

1102
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,760
basically the one that

1103
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,480
is not that clear

1104
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,520
and from a from perspective this this uh

1105
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,720
should be like a request response

1106
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,839
interface

1107
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,560
and you send as inputs the inputs i've

1108
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,839
said like three times before the

1109
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,839
topology of the configuration the

1110
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,000
traffic demands of your network

1111
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,839
and then you get an output uh three

1112
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,520
matrices with the performance metrics

1113
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,000
like the delay jitter and loss

1114
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,160
next please

1115
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,359
but we think that this this requires

1116
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,440
more discussion for example maybe you

1117
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
want multi-vendor compatibility you know

1118
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
you want to

1119
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,480
use a digital twin for some from a

1120
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,880
specific vendor for some tasks or maybe

1121
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,359
you need uh then to swap it for some

1122
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,280
some another digital thing from another

1123
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,560
vendor

1124
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
um also we don't really

1125
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,280
understand which control plane element

1126
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,680
should we connect should we connect to

1127
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,960
an intern based interface should we

1128
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
connect to

1129
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,330
um

1130
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,119
[Music]

1131
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,960
to an sdn controller

1132
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
and also i said that the type of

1133
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,839
interface should be a request response

1134
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,440
but maybe you want the publish subscribe

1135
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,119
model in which you are continuously

1136
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,319
evaluating the performance of the

1137
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,400
network because you want to adjust in

1138
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,359
real time some performance parameters

1139
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,839
should include inside the digital twin

1140
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
the validation of the sla so just you

1141
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,839
know like a boolean telling you okay the

1142
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,319
sla is okay it's not okay or maybe this

1143
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,760
is usually something done in the

1144
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,599
management plane

1145
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,160
next please

1146
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,079
and finally well i have a quick notes

1147
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,960
about the implementation next please

1148
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
well we already presented this table

1149
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,920
in the previous meeting so i'm going to

1150
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,760
go quickly very quickly over it because

1151
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,960
also

1152
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,680
we

1153
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,280
more or less saw the same in the

1154
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
previous uh presentation no so the first

1155
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,720
thing you

1156
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,440
consider when you want to build

1157
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,520
now you can do it with simulation and

1158
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,200
because network simulators are very

1159
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,520
accurate um and also they support

1160
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
virtually any feature and if things

1161
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
don't support you can implement it but

1162
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
the key point is that they

1163
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,359
take a lot of time to run for example

1164
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,280
we've seen that like 10 gigabit links

1165
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,839
can take like 11 hours to simulate

1166
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,520
and we said that we

1167
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,280
would like a digital index fast to

1168
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
perform random optimization

1169
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
the next you could think about these are

1170
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,160
killing theory models because they are

1171
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,440
super fast

1172
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,560
and

1173
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,960
they can provide reasonable accuracy but

1174
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,640
there is contentions on the research

1175
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,800
community that

1176
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
they

1177
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
suffer from accuracy when you have

1178
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,560
realistic traffic models like tcp or

1179
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,760
equivalent

1180
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,200
and finally we had to look at machine

1181
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,480
learning models

1182
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,920
and well we tested different machine

1183
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,119
learning models

1184
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,880
and our conclusion is that graph neural

1185
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,480
networks that are a kind of neural

1186
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,839
networks that

1187
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
are able to understand graphs

1188
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,839
are the ones that offer outstanding

1189
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,960
accuracy

1190
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,400
basically because i mean the input is a

1191
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,839
graph so it's they naturally

1192
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,400
render to to

1193
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,440
this nice performance next please

1194
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,680
but why i'm talking about implementation

1195
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,240
in a research group well um if we are

1196
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
about to work with machine learning well

1197
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,599
it's a continuously developing

1198
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,400
technology it's really complex

1199
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,599
and

1200
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
and there are some limitations that are

1201
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,800
not

1202
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,079
are different from what we're used to in

1203
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,760
networking no so

1204
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
i don't know maybe you have a

1205
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,440
switch and you know that it the the

1206
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,920
backplane goes at one time a bit and

1207
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,680
you can do your calculations more or

1208
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,720
less but for example with machine

1209
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,599
learning

1210
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
well everyone knows that it needs a lot

1211
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,480
of uh data to train maybe you cannot

1212
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
you don't have this data

1213
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,040
maybe

1214
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,440
um you have some legal limitations on

1215
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,880
obtaining this data or it's from a

1216
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,079
customer and you cannot ask your

1217
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,760
customer data

1218
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,440
and also another interesting point is

1219
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,520
that the usually machine learning models

1220
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,440
cannot predict what they have not seen

1221
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,720
so if i have a model and

1222
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,200
i haven't tried it with

1223
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
samples of a network that is congested

1224
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,440
it will never ever tell me that

1225
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,119
my network will get congested and this

1226
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,520
is not really useful

1227
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,280
and in order to understand also all

1228
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,040
these limitations we

1229
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,119
implemented a

1230
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,359
performance digital twin prototype that

1231
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,359
is called raw neterlen

1232
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,359
and it's based on gnns and we have open

1233
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,040
source here you can get it on on github

1234
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,720
in order that so that people know more

1235
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,280
or less the limitations of and play with

1236
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,480
it and understand the imitation of this

1237
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,920
technology

1238
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,480
i think that's all

1239
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,400
yeah

1240
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,839
no we have

1241
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,440
two minutes

1242
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,920
so if there are comments or questions

1243
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,440
to jordi and your co-first

1244
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,240
i mean i'm sure since the network

1245
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,720
digital twin topic will be under also uh

1246
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
later

1247
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,400
next presentation and this evening there

1248
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,680
will be a lot of questions for

1249
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,319
follow-ups but thanks

1250
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,800
okay our next speaker will be danian or

1251
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,800
hungry

1252
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,480
you can start your presentation you have

1253
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,760
five minutes for twice so you can i mean

1254
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
take 10 minutes

1255
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,400
to the

1256
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,880
presentation thank you

1257
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
okay can you hear me

1258
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,800
yes we can hear you well

1259
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,839
okay then i will give a present about

1260
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,800
the two drafts in her

1261
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,400
and the next slide please

1262
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,040
and the first one is about the digital

1263
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,400
team network flow simulation

1264
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
you know some important application

1265
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,920
scenarios of the digital team network

1266
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,800
all require the workflow in the

1267
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,440
twin network to accurately simulate the

1268
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,040
real flow in the physical network

1269
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,400
for example

1270
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,839
network new

1271
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,079
technology experiment network

1272
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,160
configuration verification network

1273
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,119
performance optimization and so on

1274
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,480
so how to accurately simulate the real

1275
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,640
flow is our question

1276
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,240
and to solve the problem we propose

1277
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,880
we propose this the following methods to

1278
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,440
realize the

1279
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,200
high-fidelity simulation of the physical

1280
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,440
flow by the twin flow

1281
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,280
and it also needs to satisfy the

1282
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,680
three

1283
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,960
following the

1284
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,839
satisfying the following three

1285
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,520
characteristics at the same time

1286
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,240
which can be concluded as the three

1287
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,160
consistent

1288
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,960
the

1289
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,920
forwarding pieces are consistent means

1290
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,280
that

1291
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,599
the thing knows that chin flow passes

1292
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,240
through as the thin network layer are

1293
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,359
consistent with the physical nodes that

1294
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,280
physical flow passes through as a

1295
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,760
physical network layer

1296
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,079
and the second one is that

1297
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:52,960
means

1298
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,160
the twin flow and the physical flow have

1299
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,000
the same performances as network delay

1300
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,359
packets lose and jitter

1301
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,400
data characteristics is our consistent

1302
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,960
means that the data packets of twin flow

1303
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,119
and fiscal flow have the same key

1304
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,040
characteristics

1305
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,240
and next slide piece

1306
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,440
so as the as shown in the animation

1307
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
on the right uh please

1308
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,240
click the play the animation

1309
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,440
the most perfect twin flow satisfying

1310
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,800
that the data forwarding pace forwarding

1311
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,000
time and

1312
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,640
the flow data are exactly same with the

1313
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,880
physical traffic

1314
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,559
please help to

1315
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,160
play the animation songs

1316
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
i'm sorry but this is a pdf and i think

1317
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,720
the animation is not playable right now

1318
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,880
okay okay

1319
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,359
however this is obviously impossible

1320
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,240
because data collection takes time and

1321
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,520
the package bypass

1322
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,920
so how should we implement the

1323
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,240
simulation of the twin flow

1324
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,839
it needs to

1325
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,319
we think that it needs to satisfy the

1326
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,480
three k technologies

1327
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,960
first is that the physical network

1328
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,839
element and the twin network element

1329
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,200
have unique identifiers in the entire

1330
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,559
network

1331
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,599
second is that the data transmission

1332
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,720
network

1333
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,000
between the

1334
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
physical network and digital team

1335
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,040
network you uh are using the data nice

1336
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,359
networking uh

1337
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,520
the third is that

1338
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,640
only the key information of cisco flow

1339
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,079
is collected so some payload information

1340
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,280
doesn't

1341
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,319
need to

1342
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,279
be collected

1343
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,960
so next slide piece

1344
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,839
uh so this page gives the advantage of

1345
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,119
the proposed simulated mess measures uh

1346
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,520
the first one is that the forwarding

1347
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,440
pace forwarding time and keyflow

1348
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,599
information are consistent

1349
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,319
between twin flow and physical flow

1350
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,280
and it can meet the needs of various

1351
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,720
sceneries

1352
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,079
and what's more is easy to implement

1353
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,040
next slide piece

1354
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,720
and then is the second chapter one-way

1355
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,559
delay environment method based on

1356
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,480
digital team network

1357
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,480
and this one is based on the last one

1358
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,160
so as we know

1359
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,599
transitional

1360
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,640
network delay measurement measures

1361
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,040
are including active environment passive

1362
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,359
environment hebrew environment

1363
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,480
and so on

1364
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,000
but all these moments are have some

1365
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,680
disadvantages such as

1366
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,680
it requires special test package and

1367
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,200
time sync synchronization and cannot

1368
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,800
test all the all network protocols

1369
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,880
and it needs to change the form format

1370
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,640
of service packets

1371
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,200
so there will have some problems in

1372
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,880
actual deployment

1373
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,839
and

1374
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,800
we propose the method to

1375
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
solve this some

1376
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,960
solve this and

1377
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,280
it can really cite

1378
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,839
no need to send environment package no

1379
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,760
need to change the fiscal network

1380
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,319
configuration no need to change the

1381
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,040
format of service package and no

1382
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,280
required fiscal network elements to

1383
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,000
sports the tempsic

1384
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,240
synchronization protocol also next slide

1385
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,479
case

1386
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,880
so this page is about

1387
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,680
the specific solutions

1388
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,119
first according to the digital team

1389
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,319
network architecture build we

1390
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,480
we can build a digital team layer

1391
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,040
including twin network elements are

1392
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,200
corresponding to physical network

1393
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,280
elements

1394
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
then maintains a time synchronization

1395
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,240
between each twin network element in the

1396
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,200
digital team layer and it

1397
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,319
can be choose two cases

1398
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,200
first

1399
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,799
one is if multi if multiple twin network

1400
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,799
elements are in the same physical

1401
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,240
analytic such as the unify based

1402
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,839
modeling methods

1403
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,240
where multiple twin network elements are

1404
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,400
deployed in one server

1405
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,280
and share the same local clock the thing

1406
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,680
network elements themselves is time

1407
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,079
synchronized

1408
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,839
the other one is that

1409
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,200
if multiple twin network elements are

1410
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,559
deployed in different physical

1411
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,839
entities use ptp or ntp

1412
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,240
to achieve time synchronization between

1413
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,119
physical and techniques

1414
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,359
to ensure the

1415
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,079
time synchronization of all things

1416
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,119
network elements

1417
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,799
and the the data transmission from the

1418
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,040
fiscal network layer to the digital

1419
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,240
thing layer

1420
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,040
will use a delayed deterministic network

1421
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,839
to ensure that the data transmission

1422
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,240
delay between each physical network

1423
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,079
elements are the twin network elements

1424
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,280
is a deterministic and

1425
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,799
uh are precoc

1426
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:47,359
pre-co-killable

1427
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,240
also when a flow of the fiscal network

1428
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,319
is input from the physical network

1429
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,000
element one uh you can see the

1430
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,200
figure in the right uh

1431
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,839
when the overflow of the network

1432
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,000
physical network is input from the

1433
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,400
physical network element one passes

1434
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,559
through the fiscal network elements two

1435
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,280
and three and finally is output from the

1436
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,240
physical

1437
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,400
network element for

1438
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,000
uh and when physical network element one

1439
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
receives the data package it will

1440
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,960
normally forwards the data to physical

1441
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,160
network element to and transmit the data

1442
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,640
to ting network element 1 at the same

1443
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,440
time

1444
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,240
at this time the local time of the twin

1445
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
network element 1 is

1446
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,119
can be seen as a

1447
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,559
little t1 and the deterministic network

1448
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,280
transmission delay is

1449
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,720
a big t1

1450
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,960
since the arrival time of the traffic

1451
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,520
information recorded by the twin network

1452
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,000
element is the litho t1 minus the big t

1453
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,559
one similarly the arrival time of the

1454
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,680
data package recorded by other thing

1455
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,440
network elements

1456
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,119
is little t and minus little t and the

1457
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,319
big tn

1458
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,440
and next slide piece

1459
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,880
uh according to the arrival time of the

1460
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,040
data package as the twin network

1461
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,319
elements

1462
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,119
is one way a transmission delay between

1463
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,440
physical network elements

1464
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,200
can be calculated

1465
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,880
so for example

1466
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,240
if iudp data package is transmitted from

1467
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,200
physical element network element 1 to

1468
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,079
physical network element 3.

1469
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:34,880
the

1470
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,200
one-way transmission delay is as follows

1471
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,400
and under the pre premise of time

1472
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,640
synchronization between twin network

1473
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,280
elements the transmission delay of

1474
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,880
packets of any protocol type in any two

1475
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,599
physical network elements is equal to

1476
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,480
the

1477
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,799
following formulas

1478
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,880
so as a conclusion

1479
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,280
time signal synchronization between

1480
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,839
physical network elements is not

1481
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,839
required during the

1482
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,880
measurement process and the accuracy of

1483
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,200
delay environment depends on the time

1484
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,839
synchronization accuracy of the team

1485
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,319
network elements and the time

1486
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,680
synchronization accuracy of the delayed

1487
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,280
deterministic network

1488
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,319
so if both use the ptp synchronization

1489
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,599
protocol

1490
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,079
the delay management accuracy can reach

1491
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,119
the

1492
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,599
nanosecond level

1493
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,720
so next slide please

1494
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,920
also for next steps

1495
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,599
we will stress

1496
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,359
realization of

1497
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,839
of system solutions and verify program

1498
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,799
performances and

1499
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,720
we also welcome proposals to enhance the

1500
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,079
jobs

1501
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,319
thanks

1502
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,280
thank you

1503
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,359
we have people in line

1504
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,119
alex first please

1505
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,079
so thank you i i have actually a

1506
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,640
fundamental question could you explain a

1507
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,480
little bit the motivation for this i did

1508
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,559
not quite get that well one thing

1509
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,559
basically is i'm not sure if basically

1510
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,480
within the digital twin network you

1511
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
would actually have twins of every flow

1512
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,960
of every packet and so maybe you can

1513
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,799
explain a little bit that the second

1514
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,799
thing is why would you not just measure

1515
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:23,839
perform the measurement in the

1516
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,359
production network as opposed to in the

1517
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,359
digital twin who is concerned with the

1518
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,359
measurements in the digital twin really

1519
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,200
actually want to have the actual

1520
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,799
thing there so maybe you can

1521
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,960
explain a little bit better why or what

1522
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
is motivating your work

1523
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,960
thanks

1524
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,400
okay thanks for your question uh and we

1525
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,760
think that uh uh

1526
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,359
by this way we can get uh

1527
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,720
an accurately flow simulation and the

1528
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,839
delay can be married

1529
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:02,510
not

1530
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,520
[Music]

1531
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,920
can be married

1532
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,640
uh um

1533
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,440
and the fiscal network is not changed

1534
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,680
and uh it's just a

1535
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,400
uh take requirements for the thing

1536
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,640
network uh and it should not need the

1537
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,040
physical network to be

1538
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,839
time-synchronized

1539
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,079
okay so so maybe just sort of to clarify

1540
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,160
perhaps what can you do with this that

1541
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,240
you couldn't do if you were just

1542
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,760
measuring in the

1543
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,559
in the actual network

1544
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,799
what's the additional value i guess you

1545
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,880
have by measuring on the digital twin

1546
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
maybe just for the sake of time

1547
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,799
nanyang and alex please address the

1548
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,119
question offline on the mailing list or

1549
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,359
directly please because we have also

1550
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,160
other people in the queue so albert and

1551
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,599
andy

1552
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,920
yeah hi this is albert from the pc so i

1553
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,680
have a similar question

1554
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,400
uh

1555
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,720
as a alexander right

1556
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,640
so i don't really understand

1557
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,640
so if you can measure the real thing why

1558
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
do you need a digital network now this

1559
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,119
brings me to two actual questions the

1560
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,720
first one is

1561
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,200
um it seems to imply your drafts that

1562
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,960
you need the same amount of resources

1563
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,039
for the digital twin than for the

1564
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,799
physical network

1565
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,640
uh that's the first question i i don't

1566
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,160
know if that's correct or not so the

1567
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,480
digital network is actually a network of

1568
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,400
routers which are pretty much doing the

1569
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,440
same thing

1570
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,039
as the physical network is this correct

1571
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,680
yes the uh

1572
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,720
the main reason is that the physical

1573
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,240
networks are not affected and we just

1574
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,479
uh

1575
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,160
take the

1576
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,920
which we just made in the thing network

1577
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,359
layer

1578
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,599
okay understood and

1579
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,520
my second one is rather a common and i

1580
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,599
would like to see your understanding

1581
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,440
i have a feeling that we have like a

1582
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,680
requirement on digital twins that we

1583
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,880
never

1584
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,400
put explicitly

1585
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,240
but somehow we understand digital twin

1586
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,000
that's something that will tell me what

1587
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,200
will happen

1588
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,359
if i change something on the network if

1589
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,520
i have a certain traffic

1590
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,079
but it's not um

1591
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,079
it's more about the future and what

1592
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,839
different scenarios rather than what is

1593
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,280
happening in the present because in the

1594
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,960
present i already have my physical

1595
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,039
network i don't know your view on that i

1596
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,200
didn't put very well this requirement

1597
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,280
i don't know how to express it but

1598
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,039
i don't know if you have an opinion on

1599
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,039
that

1600
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,319
okay we can

1601
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,119
have more discussions offline and we

1602
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,559
think

1603
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,799
is

1604
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:03,340
not

1605
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,559
[Music]

1606
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,280
it can't be simple

1607
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,200
give a simple

1608
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,799
explanation

1609
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,640
okay thank you

1610
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,279
oh okay

1611
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:17,680
okay

1612
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,880
thanks a lot daniang for the

1613
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
presentation i think there are some

1614
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,720
interesting questions to address uh to

1615
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,400
clarify um

1616
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,960
some aspect of your proposals and i

1617
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,839
invite

1618
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,440
the discussion to continue offline on

1619
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,359
the mailing list or directly between the

1620
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,680
the participants thanks again

1621
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,799
uh so

1622
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,559
in the agenda we we were planning to

1623
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,400
have a quick wrap-up on the network

1624
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,200
digital twin activity uh proposing the

1625
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,599
anarchy

1626
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:44,400
so

1627
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,960
the goal here is in fact um

1628
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,119
we have received more proposal and more

1629
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,839
inputs on this topic in the nmg in

1630
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,720
recent in recent time in the past few

1631
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,000
months

1632
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,839
so we see that this is a growing topic

1633
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,079
of interest not only in energy but but

1634
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,680
also in other communities other groups

1635
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,680
and this is why in fact we invite people

1636
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,079
to attend if they can the side meeting

1637
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,520
that we have this evening but there will

1638
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,799
be also follow-up discussion on the

1639
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,599
mailing list or by other means the goal

1640
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,680
is in fact to just to understand a bit

1641
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,920
the future direction of these different

1642
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,280
proposals uh energy could be a forum for

1643
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,960
some of the discussion it's a research

1644
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,559
group so we want to focus on these

1645
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,240
research activities

1646
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,319
we see that there are other

1647
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,079
proposals that are more towards

1648
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,400
solidization or engineering or even

1649
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,640
implementation etc so these are very

1650
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,799
interesting proposals what we would like

1651
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,280
to clarify is impact

1652
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,920
in the scale of irtf and ietf what could

1653
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,920
be the the landing

1654
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,079
spots for this activity

1655
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,599
depending on the type of activity and

1656
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,599
also maybe to share information and

1657
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,200
coordinate with what's happening a bit

1658
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
uh in other groups

1659
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,280
and in the research community so um this

1660
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,880
will be some of the point we would like

1661
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,200
to discuss uh later on in the summiting

1662
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,400
and again

1663
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,559
for for to make it available to anyone

1664
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,559
also on the mailing list so this was

1665
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,480
just to wrap up a bit this uh this

1666
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,400
discussion thank you everyone we are now

1667
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,319
switching to another topic of the agenda

1668
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,559
which is on green networking we have

1669
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,039
two presentation also a new draft have

1670
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,839
been proposed in different i mean

1671
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,319
for ietf rtf

1672
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,000
and the first presentation will be from

1673
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,400
alex

1674
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,359
okay thank you so yes so this

1675
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,559
presentation

1676
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,039
uh is basically on a potential new topic

1677
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,280
to look at here in the scope of uh of

1678
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,760
nmrg and this concerns the topic of

1679
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,160
management for green or also well

1680
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,079
sustainable networking

1681
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,760
in general there are two associated

1682
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,079
drafts with this serious challenges and

1683
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,760
opportunities in green networking i

1684
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,680
think this one is specifically

1685
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,520
um actually suitable actually for

1686
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,440
discussion in nmrg

1687
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,960
and there's also a companion draft from

1688
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,480
green networking metrics and you see

1689
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,280
basically i'm i'm presenting on behalf

1690
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,200
of a number of co-authors

1691
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,680
um next please

1692
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,640
so the question why green networking and

1693
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,599
why management for it well i i think

1694
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,520
i think everybody is aware that reducing

1695
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,039
the carbon footprint

1696
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,079
is one of mankind's grand challenges um

1697
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,680
and of course networking applications

1698
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,000
have been a key enabler in this by

1699
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,559
reducing travel by enabling remote work

1700
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,160
etc

1701
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,000
however the question is this

1702
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,599
is this enough

1703
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,520
and specifically

1704
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,440
the issue is that networks themselves

1705
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,880
consume a lot of

1706
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,559
energy and therefore

1707
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,880
net zero mandates that apply across

1708
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,559
industries and so forth

1709
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,640
will apply and actually in fact are

1710
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,559
already in part being applied to network

1711
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,680
providers

1712
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,839
um as well so clearly something

1713
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,839
to think about

1714
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,359
there are well

1715
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,240
various contributors to network energy

1716
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,599
efficiency today and basically

1717
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,760
efficient usage of efficiency and so

1718
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,599
forth there are of course general

1719
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,640
hardware advances

1720
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,960
benefits from from moore's law

1721
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,880
deployment factors do you basically

1722
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,920
deploy

1723
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,160
in the colder temperature and so forth

1724
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,719
advances in at the at the lower layers

1725
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,880
antenna technology and so forth

1726
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,679
um

1727
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,560
many of those factors are

1728
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,120
well important and they are big factors

1729
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,560
however they are kind of like outside

1730
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,799
what we itf and so forth they could

1731
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,920
control

1732
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,799
um

1733
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,399
but what about

1734
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,479
network and management specific factors

1735
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:35,679
and

1736
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,000
where basically ietf and irtf could make

1737
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,439
a contribution

1738
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,439
and so this even if this may be a

1739
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,198
smaller aspect of the overall equation

1740
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,640
and anything counts so this is kind of

1741
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,560
like the motivation for this next please

1742
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,679
so in some observations

1743
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,479
why

1744
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,080
i believe we believe this is

1745
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,479
specifically also a management topic is

1746
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,799
for one basically management in many

1747
01:08:58,799 --> 01:08:59,839
cases

1748
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:00,880
involves

1749
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,960
questions of optimization already right

1750
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,279
so basically whether you see many

1751
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,640
research papers on how to place vms how

1752
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,960
do you place vnfs

1753
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,279
how do you plan routes and segments and

1754
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,479
paths optimize according to various

1755
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,279
various ways and always busy moderating

1756
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,799
different types of trade-offs which are

1757
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:21,839
involved

1758
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,600
and well in this

1759
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,399
of course well energy usage and

1760
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,719
energy efficiency and so forth is yet

1761
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,319
another parameter

1762
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,319
um that can be optimized and that

1763
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,158
perhaps has not been so much the focus

1764
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,158
in the past but really perhaps it should

1765
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,359
be

1766
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,359
and um

1767
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,759
also in many cases management involves

1768
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,640
control loops i mean i think rfc 7575

1769
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,640
was mentioned earlier autonomic right so

1770
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,080
till you have the loop there so you

1771
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,679
always have some kind of

1772
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,520
variation of that you

1773
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,279
observe something

1774
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,080
um you analyze it based on this you make

1775
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,840
certain decisions and then you basically

1776
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,239
act to modify it and then the and this

1777
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,719
and this and the circle closes

1778
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:03,679
and

1779
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,640
um

1780
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,960
and for those control loops those apply

1781
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,280
clearly also to optimizing energy

1782
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,560
efficiency

1783
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,159
and um

1784
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,120
of course short time scales are

1785
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,719
are required but one thing this

1786
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,960
basically sets up one of the drafts is

1787
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,640
one thing that is a common denominator

1788
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,800
in a lot of those things regardless what

1789
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,560
your decisions or what your particular

1790
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,760
purpose

1791
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
is of the optimization you do need to

1792
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,280
have visibility

1793
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,199
into what it is that you're optimizing

1794
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,120
so you do need to have visibility into

1795
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,120
how energy is being used how much energy

1796
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,360
is being used and so forth

1797
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,719
and finally

1798
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,400
another aspect that

1799
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,920
we believe actually can be can be

1800
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,400
leveraged concerns the fact

1801
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,920
and this actually makes it also more of

1802
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,040
a challenge

1803
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,080
that communications is

1804
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,040
or the

1805
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,960
incremental energy use in communications

1806
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,320
is not

1807
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,719
is not linear so basically when you

1808
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,480
think about it basically when the

1809
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,800
to transmit the first bit you need to

1810
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,640
power up an equipment that basically

1811
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,960
creates well this requires

1812
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,199
uh of course a lot of energy usage right

1813
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,960
there so basically the cost of the first

1814
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,880
bit is very high versus subsequent ones

1815
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
then we see if you utilize it higher it

1816
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,640
really doesn't make much of a

1817
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,679
of a difference and this suggests uh

1818
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,440
questions of course how to leverage and

1819
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,840
exploit that that there are

1820
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,760
large potential gains for instance by

1821
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,159
being able to idling resources and

1822
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,760
taking them offline and so forth when

1823
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,360
they're not when they're not needed and

1824
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,960
doing this basically in rapid time

1825
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,880
scales and support so this is certainly

1826
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,679
one

1827
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,440
potential thing to explore to manage

1828
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,960
towards that

1829
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,000
and next

1830
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,400
so basically in the uh

1831
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,000
in the draft so the the

1832
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,679
the first draft concerns the problem

1833
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,800
statements or the challenges and

1834
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,080
opportunity

1835
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,920
uh opportunities

1836
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,480
we decided to structure these challenges

1837
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,000
and opportunities basically into four

1838
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,520
different areas

1839
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,360
starting basically with what you can do

1840
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,760
at the equipment or individual device

1841
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,120
levels

1842
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,360
device level and then looking at okay

1843
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,120
what could you do at the protocol level

1844
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
at the level of the network as a whole

1845
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,640
and then finally of the overall network

1846
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,000
architecture next

1847
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,199
next

1848
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,320
so

1849
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
um so at the device and equipment level

1850
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,239
this is basically where perhaps many of

1851
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,040
the most obvious things immediately lie

1852
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,800
and many of those aspects of course

1853
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,760
again

1854
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,960
concern

1855
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,480
power efficient hardware eco-friendly

1856
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,400
materials and so forth important but

1857
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,040
outside ietf scope

1858
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,880
perhaps more

1859
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,640
getting closer is basically

1860
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,320
other for instance things such as energy

1861
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,640
saving policies this is very common

1862
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,239
endpoints you have power saving modes

1863
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,400
etc but what about equipment inside the

1864
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,600
network

1865
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
we don't really see much of that here

1866
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,360
there and the question is what would

1867
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,960
those types of things look like

1868
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,239
and

1869
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,239
then basically

1870
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,640
and of specific interest also in the

1871
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,880
prerequisite for a lot of things is how

1872
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,800
do you provide visibility into the

1873
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,960
current energy usage so basically how

1874
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,040
can you even assess that and basically

1875
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,520
validate with whatever

1876
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,800
things whatever

1877
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,400
uh aspects you are

1878
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,600
applying

1879
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,120
uh yeah

1880
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,080
whether

1881
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,800
how well they actually work and

1882
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,320
so basically this requires

1883
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,159
instrumentation inside the network this

1884
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,760
is something that is relatively

1885
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,080
immediately i guess actionable and it

1886
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,840
requires also energy metrics of the

1887
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,000
right uh types of energy energy matrix

1888
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,960
to base these things on and i see dane

1889
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,800
has a question do we take questions now

1890
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,120
all right

1891
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,840
okay so then the next aspect concerns

1892
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,280
the protocol level

1893
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,120
and this basically is the question well

1894
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,480
what can be done

1895
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,320
well is are actually several aspects of

1896
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,120
this

1897
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,760
so one thing one can think about about

1898
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,040
well what would be needed

1899
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,600
in terms of protocol support to enable

1900
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,400
certain mechanisms or methods to save

1901
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,400
energy so for instance

1902
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
uh one of the things i mentioned earlier

1903
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,840
was well what if you could take for

1904
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,480
instance take resources offline

1905
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,840
when they're not really utilized

1906
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,920
obviously there are controversies what

1907
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,960
does it

1908
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,480
make lead for a longer discussion but

1909
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,960
assuming basically that you can do that

1910
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,679
um well today one of the issues is it's

1911
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,280
often not practical due to the time

1912
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,880
scale so if you take it offline and you

1913
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,480
want to take it online

1914
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,239
a lot of time elapses when you find out

1915
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,000
that actually yeah you really would have

1916
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,840
needed those resources for redundancy or

1917
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,120
for whatever

1918
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,040
type of type of reasons

1919
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,560
and so the question is well what if

1920
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,400
those time scales could be dramatically

1921
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,600
shortened

1922
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,679
and if you had that you would still need

1923
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:38,960
to do certain things at the network

1924
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,880
level right you would need to be able to

1925
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,480
fastly discover what is the current

1926
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,159
status you need to you would need to be

1927
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,280
able to

1928
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,440
reconverge any state that would have

1929
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,360
changed at the network level very

1930
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,840
quickly and so forth and so this is

1931
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,280
these are things that potentially

1932
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,560
require

1933
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,960
thinking about what is required at the

1934
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,120
at the at the core level

1935
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,080
clearly

1936
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,080
autonomics have a role to play there

1937
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,000
intent-based networking has a role to

1938
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,040
play there

1939
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,640
and so forth

1940
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,640
second aspect concerns also points to

1941
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,760
think about such relatively

1942
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,920
if you think about

1943
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,679
simple things to doing about how can we

1944
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,440
make for instance the tables that need

1945
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,040
to be maintained in the network smaller

1946
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,719
if you require

1947
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,480
less hardware again less state that you

1948
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,679
need to

1949
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,000
synchronize and pass around presumably

1950
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,080
you would be you would become more

1951
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,400
energy efficient so this has questions

1952
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,199
with

1953
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,640
how do you address your network how do

1954
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,640
you deploy how do you partition the

1955
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,880
spaces it's about with energy efficiency

1956
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,560
usage in mind

1957
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,520
and then

1958
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,280
well then there are many other aspects

1959
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,719
such as for instance how could you for

1960
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,000
instance

1961
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,679
apply traffic adaptation that you

1962
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,000
basically maximize efficiency based on

1963
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,679
whether whether it's beneficial to have

1964
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,560
smooth transition often good to avoid

1965
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,159
congestion and collision and support on

1966
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,000
the other hand sometimes and i think we

1967
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,679
see this particular points in low power

1968
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,239
environment it is actually beneficial to

1969
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,719
transmit bursty so basically having some

1970
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,560
periods of silence and then basically

1971
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,480
transmitting a diversity thing and so so

1972
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,960
these all of these things are

1973
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,800
over thinking about

1974
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,520
next one please

1975
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,920
and uh well then at the network level

1976
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,880
there are

1977
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,600
uh things to think about it basically

1978
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,719
then

1979
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,760
well if energy is a cost factor or power

1980
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,920
efficiency is well are there foreign

1981
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,000
certain energy related control protocol

1982
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,080
extensions that would be needed in order

1983
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,320
to find the make sdn controllers or make

1984
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,000
distributed control claims and support

1985
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,880
aware of that and and leverage that

1986
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,000
similarly

1987
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,960
topics of energy aware routing energy

1988
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,199
aware path configuration

1989
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,199
which allow to assess forcing the carbon

1990
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:51,120
intensity one flip away or another

1991
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,960
offer path and then basically optimize

1992
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,400
the network to minimize the overall

1993
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,719
footprint for instance to be aware to

1994
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,640
steer traffic among if there are

1995
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,960
different alternatives steer them

1996
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,199
along the one which is greener

1997
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,199
by some definition those are basically

1998
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,159
topics that are worth uh doing

1999
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,760
spending research on

2000
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,520
similarly well i'm i was mentioning

2001
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,360
basically the

2002
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,280
uh the issue well what if we could force

2003
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,360
an idol and take offline and online

2004
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,719
resources again so this would be

2005
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,480
basically this is a topic of resource

2006
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,000
weaning schemes

2007
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,520
at the network level

2008
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,199
um and then there are other aspects

2009
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,440
right so for instance again

2010
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,840
well just like there's placement of

2011
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
virtual machines the question of how do

2012
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,040
you place

2013
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,280
virtual network functions for instance

2014
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,040
again with the

2015
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,520
with the power usage efficiency in mind

2016
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,360
are

2017
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,719
going to there and of course for all of

2018
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,239
this you need to have also green

2019
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,320
abstractions that apply to the network

2020
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,480
as a whole that also have a holistic

2021
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,920
picture

2022
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,760
can you speed up a bit of time for a

2023
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,480
question thank you all right okay

2024
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,480
i have one minute yeah one minute will

2025
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,640
be fine all right okay good so the next

2026
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,920
please

2027
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,760
i'm almost done i think so one of the

2028
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,159
subjects is there as the

2029
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,320
as a one of them

2030
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,400
concrete first steps basically is the

2031
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,840
companion draft to the challenges

2032
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
opportunity concerning network energy

2033
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,440
metrics because again

2034
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,719
it starts with providing visibility

2035
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,280
and yeah so basically there's this draft

2036
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,320
which

2037
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
defines basically or but you attempt to

2038
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,920
set a define of

2039
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,840
of

2040
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,199
matrix according to different well

2041
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,800
associated with different aspects right

2042
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,679
the

2043
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,159
um the the related to the equipment but

2044
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,920
also related to flows

2045
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,920
related to paths and related to the

2046
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,199
network at large again this is maybe

2047
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,199
not so much a research topic so more

2048
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,640
actionable so perhaps this one doesn't

2049
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,560
belong into nmrg but i just want to put

2050
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
it here next one and i think that's the

2051
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,040
last one

2052
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:50,880
so yeah so

2053
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,640
basically

2054
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,560
the intent here was to to raise

2055
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,400
awareness and gain critical mass on this

2056
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,960
as a topic and

2057
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,640
look for collaborators also encourage

2058
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,199
more research into that area and we are

2059
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,120
also looking for the proper landing spot

2060
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,280
it seems that at least for the research

2061
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,280
opportunities and challenges nmrg may be

2062
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,560
the right place

2063
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,120
and for this uh yeah we would uh

2064
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,360
ask for feedback so

2065
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,360
thanks and uh yeah hi dan bogdanovic um

2066
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,159
in

2067
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,280
there are two

2068
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,760
problems with energy and

2069
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,440
telecommunication

2070
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,920
one is the optics that's the biggest

2071
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,199
consumer

2072
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,400
in the

2073
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,640
in in the networking today

2074
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,679
and uh you cannot turn lasers on and off

2075
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,000
on demand because they take a few

2076
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,520
seconds to

2077
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,040
warm up and start propagating the

2078
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,600
information throughout the network

2079
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,520
this is where majority of your energy

2080
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,920
consumption is if you look at any of

2081
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,320
those nice boxes that the vendors are

2082
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,760
doing if it's an optical box suddenly

2083
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,360
box way stuns

2084
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,120
and uses

2085
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,440
kilowatts of power

2086
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,679
but all that power goes into the optics

2087
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,520
so that's an optical problem and

2088
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,960
material science problem that i don't

2089
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,800
think we are

2090
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,960
the right place to solve but that way is

2091
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,679
that

2092
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,080
that is the major major problem that has

2093
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,040
to be solved and then the other stuff is

2094
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,760
you're looking for a new semantic

2095
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,719
to add new semantics to the routing

2096
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,880
and that you are deciding okay here's

2097
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,199
how we will make new routing decisions

2098
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,760
so your energy metrics there

2099
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,120
are the area which ones are the right

2100
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
ones to use

2101
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,320
to make

2102
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,080
the routing decisions and how to

2103
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,639
incorporate and how create the semantic

2104
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:41,920
that will take

2105
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,199
the energy routing into the account

2106
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,639
as well

2107
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,239
you know it doesn't mean that your

2108
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,040
shortest path from is the best path from

2109
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,199
the energy perspective

2110
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,960
because you have to know how your energy

2111
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,239
is being routed throughout the system

2112
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,440
and where is it coming from so you have

2113
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,440
to create a much more complex

2114
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,600
semantic that we don't have the

2115
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,159
expertise as well we have to talk to the

2116
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,239
energy distributors

2117
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,560
how they are doing that

2118
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,480
and how they have to route the energy

2119
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,040
you know in order to

2120
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,639
provide the

2121
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,480
demand for that

2122
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,760
so it's a

2123
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,679
multi-structural problem we can say that

2124
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,000
yeah we will make we will we need the

2125
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,159
information from you to be able to make

2126
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,840
our decisions

2127
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,159
and again i don't think we have we

2128
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,879
should be finding

2129
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,760
is there like an energy distribution

2130
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,320
organization that is looking into into

2131
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,040
those problems

2132
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,880
so yeah so so

2133
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,280
very briefly regarding those comments so

2134
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,679
first of all clearly there are big

2135
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,760
try to indicate this in maybe only a

2136
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,440
small slice that

2137
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,199
is within our control

2138
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,280
of this and clearly

2139
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,239
yeah

2140
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,400
power consumption from laser ac is a big

2141
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,480
big thing but this i i believe actually

2142
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,239
this should not prevent us from looking

2143
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,840
at the things that we can control but

2144
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,440
clearly we need to know which ones we

2145
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,000
can control and which one not regarding

2146
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,040
the

2147
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,679
uh those are the foundations you you if

2148
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,520
you if you don't can't control those

2149
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,120
things then everything else that you can

2150
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,960
control is

2151
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,280
okay never mind no okay so okay maybe

2152
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,800
this is a so i i don't believe you

2153
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,159
should just give up right i mean it

2154
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,880
sounds a little bit defeatistic but your

2155
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,400
what you're what you're suggesting if

2156
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,840
you cannot control the laser we don't

2157
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,760
need to look at it is this what you are

2158
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,400
no i'm i'm not suggesting that that we

2159
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,360
are trying to do some decisions

2160
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,920
without having the inputs from the

2161
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,639
material science guys as well as from

2162
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,120
the energy distributors

2163
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,960
because you have to take both of those

2164
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,280
into the account to be able to make

2165
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,040
the to create the right semantics that

2166
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,639
will be enabling you to do the proper

2167
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,560
routing decisions yeah but for the

2168
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,560
second thing i know we have limited time

2169
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,360
uh i think but very clearly there are

2170
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,480
many things that you can take into

2171
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,840
account but basically making this

2172
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,639
awareness as an additional factor to

2173
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,320
trade off is a

2174
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,920
is a worthwhile thing to consider i

2175
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,679
believe it clearly there are many

2176
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,679
complexities and it may not not

2177
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,199
everything may be actionable that we can

2178
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,120
define a standard right away this is

2179
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,960
precisely why i believe actually this is

2180
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,760
a this is a good topic for for irtf

2181
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,600
because things of this nature make a lot

2182
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,679
of that

2183
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,040
just only quick question quick answer if

2184
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,000
possible otherwise answer offline please

2185
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,880
okay

2186
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,719
thank you so uh thanks for your

2187
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,560
presentation i think that the topic is

2188
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,199
needed interesting and relevant

2189
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,120
while listening to your presentation i i

2190
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,040
was wondering something and maybe it's a

2191
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,040
suggestion for you to move forward right

2192
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,679
is how much so if i want to transmit one

2193
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,080
single packet i need to first build a

2194
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,239
set of networks network equipment right

2195
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,000
i need to actually build the thing and

2196
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,120
then i will

2197
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,000
uh

2198
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,840
spend energy in lasers and so on and i

2199
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,120
was wondering

2200
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,800
what is the amount of energy it takes to

2201
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,719
build uh the actual network equipment

2202
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,239
and maybe that's something that it's

2203
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,080
it's i know it's out of the scope of

2204
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,560
idea but i think that it is important to

2205
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,320
have at least uh

2206
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
to understand the scale right is is

2207
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,600
operation

2208
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,280
of networks ten percent of the whole

2209
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,120
energy consumption of building a network

2210
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,800
and operating a network or is operation

2211
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,320
just ninety percent of building the

2212
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,880
network right and operating it

2213
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,199
um that's just a subject okay i agree

2214
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,080
with your observation yes and clearly

2215
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,520
for a holistic thing that should take

2216
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,360
that into account and this is also a

2217
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,280
research topic obviously to how to

2218
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,560
optimize with that in mind

2219
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,639
bernoullis so that's an interesting

2220
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,120
topic right you observe energy etc but i

2221
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,719
want to remind people that we had a

2222
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,239
working group called iman energy

2223
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,239
management in the past it was about

2224
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,560
having power states in the network

2225
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,080
exactly for what you were mentioning

2226
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,080
it's sunday so i want to get a lower

2227
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,159
power state or you know people are on

2228
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,840
strike or whatever

2229
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,280
now we did we put that in place however

2230
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,880
what happened is that

2231
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,199
whenever we look at the use case for

2232
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,360
network deployments

2233
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,080
then there were no big use cases you

2234
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,520
know from a money point of view what i

2235
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,920
mean is that saving a port in a compass

2236
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,239
network is like nine watts so if you

2237
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,400
want to put all this in in in place

2238
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,760
which is nine watts

2239
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,360
what has come starting to be interesting

2240
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,800
is whenever you could shut down the line

2241
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,840
card

2242
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,080
then we speak like about big money but

2243
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,000
then you enter in what you mentioned the

2244
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,560
issue of the sla if it takes 40 seconds

2245
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,040
to line cartoon comes up then

2246
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,440
at that point in time i had no

2247
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,239
operator who actually wanted to do this

2248
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,480
because you are selling expensing stuff

2249
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,679
for which we're going to say going to

2250
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,000
put them offline for some time and the

2251
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,159
seo to come back whenever we speak about

2252
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,239
a couple of milliseconds of rerouting

2253
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,120
it's not the same scale so we were stuck

2254
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,120
at the use case issue

2255
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,639
right so i think the use case is clearly

2256
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,880
something to to revisit actually this is

2257
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,639
also a good segue for you to turn this

2258
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,880
presentation i believe comes next we

2259
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,199
talked about some of those past uh

2260
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,840
efforts but yeah

2261
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,800
um

2262
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,040
it's just fun to say that this is a very

2263
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,040
interesting topic and uh we should work

2264
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,719
on that um i mean it's obviously

2265
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,800
important for for for the for the whole

2266
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,400
society um

2267
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,000
and we should do our part

2268
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,719
i just wanted to draw your attention to

2269
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,120
another activity that that is uh coming

2270
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,080
up the iab is planning to launch a

2271
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,520
workshop on

2272
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,360
sort of environmental impacts of the

2273
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,080
internet and energy consumption and

2274
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,800
and so on sort of has a you know broader

2275
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,480
scope perhaps than

2276
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,600
than what you were talking about but um

2277
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,679
it's another venue where some

2278
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,360
discussions could happen

2279
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,000
it was a one-time workshop of course so

2280
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,760
it should not stop

2281
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
sensible research group and working

2282
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,840
group efforts elsewhere

2283
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,120
naturally but

2284
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,440
the idea is to have like a

2285
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,199
yeah first of all like a big picture

2286
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,040
analysis like where is the issue and

2287
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,239
drawing

2288
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,280
data center people and device people and

2289
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,040
application people and networking people

2290
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,159
not just

2291
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,760
focus on our little networking protocols

2292
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,960
look at metrics look at uh needs for new

2293
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,159
work where they will be most beneficial

2294
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,960
and uh look for solutions so that's the

2295
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,560
scope of the workshop

2296
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,480
uh announcements should come out after

2297
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,280
the

2298
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,080
okay thank you

2299
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,960
sorry thomas eckert yeah so i think with

2300
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,679
with with e-men the the best use case i

2301
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,320
saw was uh simply the poe management

2302
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,560
right so using the network as the

2303
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,480
infrastructure to

2304
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,400
really manage physically a lot of

2305
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,199
interesting devices cameras um lightning

2306
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,600
in in building and so on right so there

2307
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,920
was and i think still is the whole

2308
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,480
evolving you know new in-building

2309
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,159
network architectures like you know

2310
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,159
cheap switches that do lightning power

2311
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,239
everything under the ceiling so so i

2312
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,320
think that you know still is something

2313
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,120
to be you know taking much more use of

2314
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,440
slowly evolving right so it's kind of

2315
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,520
these industries that operate a decades

2316
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,440
cycles

2317
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,360
yeah thank you we have to to stop here

2318
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:07,519
and then you can start our presentation

2319
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,159
that was the trick right so

2320
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,239
all right

2321
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,159
okay instead of looking forward there's

2322
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,000
always a good uh

2323
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,520
thing in looking backward and trying to

2324
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,840
figure out what we have done so far next

2325
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,080
slide so this is the third draft and the

2326
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,840
name is uh down there

2327
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,920
so right so the the goal was kind of

2328
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,520
trying to to

2329
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,120
for ourselves and hopefully in the

2330
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,920
community can overview of what the ietf

2331
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,920
has done for energy to enlighten the

2332
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,239
community understand and how to apply it

2333
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,000
best and of course kind of the users of

2334
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,960
whatever

2335
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,280
we have done in the ietf

2336
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,920
developers and deployment

2337
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,000
and then of course the stuff that

2338
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,679
alex has started to

2339
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,239
present look for gaps close them look

2340
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:55,440
for new areas standards and research

2341
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,600
and yeah trying to also uh you know

2342
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
market the ietf and its work in this

2343
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,920
area whether it's for sustainability or

2344
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,840
what the example i was just giving right

2345
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,320
so all that stuff um for the draft

2346
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,800
itself it seems to be most simple as an

2347
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,040
individual submission if there's more

2348
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,800
interest maybe we get some other form of

2349
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,199
sponsorship but i think they

2350
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,960
when you when you see the broad range of

2351
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,360
topics being covered it seems like uh

2352
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,560
trying to run for itf consensus on that

2353
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,400
content will make it rather

2354
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,639
less flexible for you know individual

2355
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,040
chapters with uh individual authors and

2356
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,960
uh good opinions to be brought together

2357
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,760
um so and uh we'll get to that you know

2358
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,800
call for participation later right so

2359
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,880
um so obviously the itf has never done

2360
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,440
anything for energy right so um oh wait

2361
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,000
a second there are these uh iot

2362
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,320
low-power networks okay so we've done

2363
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,199
that

2364
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,280
and oh wasn't there one more thing and

2365
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,199
one more thing so you you really when

2366
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,280
you start looking through all the itf

2367
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,520
repositories from one area to the other

2368
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,080
it reminded me of monty python's life of

2369
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,159
brian you have to find that video clip

2370
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,840
which says what have the romans ever

2371
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,159
done for us and it's kind of yeah pretty

2372
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,159
much everything right so which obviously

2373
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,239
for energy isn't true but uh it's it's

2374
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,320
really when you see the next slides uh

2375
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:16,320
it's a lot like let's next slide

2376
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,840
okay

2377
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,159
um so the scope of the document is not

2378
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,920
only the things that people

2379
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,800
said were intentionally for

2380
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,800
uh energy and and so on but what uh i

2381
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,199
felt actually relates to energy right so

2382
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,360
a lot of stuff that is incidental and

2383
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,800
that's really when you start thinking

2384
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,440
about what has the iatf and the internet

2385
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,400
done

2386
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,840
to impact

2387
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
energy consumption on the planet and

2388
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,520
that is really pretty much everything

2389
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,960
that the ietf has done from the

2390
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,800
beginning because it has led to what we

2391
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,840
now call digitization of non-digital

2392
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,920
pre-network workflows

2393
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,400
which is really very much based on you

2394
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,880
know the foundations of the packet

2395
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,199
networking that the internet was the

2396
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,040
first and biggest one to explore in that

2397
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,800
respect right so from all the

2398
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,639
applications like mail replaced in

2399
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,120
postal mails group communication then

2400
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,960
ultimately thousands of applications

2401
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,040
that were done without digital through

2402
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,480
http html frameworks right and so when

2403
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,120
you when you look at the success factors

2404
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,040
then it's it's very much related through

2405
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,280
saving through scale right so

2406
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,560
the

2407
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,199
joule the energy per bit cost has been

2408
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,199
going down because we have an

2409
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,800
architecture with the internet that is

2410
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,960
built for scale right if you would try

2411
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,760
to replace the internet with many many

2412
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,199
parallel networks four different

2413
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,520
applications that were all smaller scale

2414
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,199
you would end up with a lot higher

2415
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,960
energy utilization

2416
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,639
right um

2417
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:45,520
so

2418
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,600
there are various aspects of the

2419
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,239
internet architecture the ietf protocols

2420
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,800
that have been contributing to this you

2421
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,159
know lowest cost heights highest scale

2422
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,880
so the datagram with the multiplexing

2423
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,040
the end-to-end transport so i'm going

2424
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,800
through uh these you know architectural

2425
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,480
foundational parts of the internet

2426
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,679
architecture relating them to in uh

2427
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,199
the energy consumption uh the

2428
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,360
convergence of network obviously being

2429
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,040
the most easy to understand right you

2430
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,639
started with data networks you had

2431
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,320
separate voice networks you had separate

2432
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,800
video networks we did diffserv we did

2433
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,159
inserv

2434
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,920
we did all these things that allowed us

2435
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,760
to integrate these different networks so

2436
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,280
we built a single network which was

2437
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,239
faster ultimately using less energy for

2438
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,880
the same applications right and voice

2439
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,719
with sip being one of the first

2440
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,679
applications that made that uh

2441
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,679
move after we had diffserv next slide

2442
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,639
to make it in two minutes okay i know

2443
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,719
this is a bit fast but it just okay sure

2444
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,040
yeah so then uh but

2445
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,960
we can go faster through this so the the

2446
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:51,920
energy

2447
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,600
saving through sustainability that's

2448
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,920
another interesting taxonomy thing that

2449
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,400
we need to think about because

2450
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,639
there are a lot interesting additional

2451
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,400
metric aspects we need to look into

2452
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,480
right so there is a difference between

2453
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,960
good renewable and bad energy that we

2454
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,639
need to take into account and we also

2455
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:09,760
need to

2456
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,960
compare um then the saving that we're

2457
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,679
getting to the pre-digital solution for

2458
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,520
example the fact that we've all been

2459
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,120
aware of that you know traveling in the

2460
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,960
airplanes

2461
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,800
on the same amount of energy consumption

2462
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,400
is worse than doing the same thing on

2463
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,800
the ground so that's where applications

2464
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,199
like tele uh collaboration uh what we've

2465
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,120
been doing in the itf ourselves come in

2466
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,280
and a lot of foundational technologies

2467
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,400
like rtc web next slide

2468
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,520
okay so then there's the whole you know

2469
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,719
page about exactly that low power

2470
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,639
lossy networks where we have many many

2471
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,560
working groups so that is being covered

2472
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,239
i'm not going to go through details to

2473
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,080
that the higher layers of that are

2474
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,000
called constraint nodes and networks

2475
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,920
also several working groups with good

2476
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,600
work on that next slide

2477
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,800
and then there are specific sample

2478
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,760
technology enablers that even recently

2479
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,560
we had been trouble and opportunities to

2480
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,960
leverage right so sleepy nodes is is a

2481
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,600
core technology to optimize through

2482
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,320
specific protocol operation the ability

2483
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,000
to run on battery or

2484
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,080
energy harvesting and then my my

2485
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,000
personal friend friending me in this

2486
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,560
case ip multicast so those technologies

2487
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,880
are covered um then uh the energy

2488
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,639
production consumption management

2489
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,040
network smart grid and the even more

2490
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,360
cool use case of the synchrophaser

2491
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,199
network so those are the networks built

2492
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,840
for the power generation and consumption

2493
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,920
so that is being covered next slide

2494
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,360
and then the e-main we mentioned that

2495
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,679
and finally the power awareness in

2496
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,000
forwarding in routing protocols that's

2497
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,760
what benoit mentioned as where we

2498
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,320
stopped because we kind of didn't have

2499
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,840
you know

2500
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,000
i think the tool set to go further i

2501
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,159
think we have some of that tool set now

2502
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,400
so we can look into it again

2503
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,199
sdn or some of the anima work that we've

2504
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,960
been doing i think will help a lot for

2505
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,360
the resilience we need so that we can

2506
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,440
low power networks better

2507
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,800
there's just a little bit of the gaps

2508
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,159
just i mean this is just trying to

2509
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:13,679
capture what we've done not what

2510
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,520
hopefully we can do um so next slide

2511
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,280
which really brings us to you know the

2512
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,199
call fraction in terms of please read it

2513
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,040
comment on it um

2514
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,239
and uh

2515
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,159
even even better so contribute to it

2516
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:27,920
you'll see a lot of chapters where you

2517
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,840
may be the expert of of any of them or

2518
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,600
you may be missing chapters so hopefully

2519
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,840
this can become a community effort

2520
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,320
um we can get a mailing list if the one

2521
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,000
that we've just randomly been looking

2522
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,400
for is not the best one so there is this

2523
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,159
old reducing energy consumption with

2524
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,679
internet product called exploration

2525
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,320
called recipe and so that might be good

2526
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,239
mailing list to to revive after it's

2527
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,080
been dormant for 10 years because that

2528
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,760
was about the time when we stopped doing

2529
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,119
all this good work

2530
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,199
and start discussing energy related work

2531
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,280
again but of course nmrg everything

2532
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,360
needs to be managed right so that's why

2533
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,360
uh such a broad topic is is i thought

2534
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,679
from our perspective very good to be uh

2535
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:05,920
you know it's it's the new vertical you

2536
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,719
know for for all of of management right

2537
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:11,119
so we had security we need to management

2538
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,880
now we have energy we need to manage

2539
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,520
that so it's also a vertical topic for

2540
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,320
this group thank you

2541
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,080
thank you very much so question and

2542
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,520
command will be

2543
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,480
taken offline um

2544
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,718
next presentation

2545
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:12,960
okay

2546
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,199
good morning nice to meet you

2547
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,159
my name is

2548
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,080
hong i'm working for

2549
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,480
petty university in south korea

2550
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,560
so first things to give a chance to

2551
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,760
present

2552
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,639
next page please

2553
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,679
yeah this is history for our last

2554
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,400
meeting we submit the attack not but at

2555
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,159
that time you don't have a time to

2556
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,719
pretend so this is the first time to

2557
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,840
present okay next page please

2558
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,440
yes this is the motivation

2559
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,520
so uh as i know that many person have

2560
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,080
some interest of the ai and ai

2561
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,520
technology but as a expert of the

2562
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,239
network and telecommunication it is not

2563
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:59,360
easy to find a

2564
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,520
item for

2565
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,840
standardization and

2566
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,000
there are some changement there are some

2567
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,400
changes in the ai area for

2568
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,679
especially the deployment ai services

2569
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,040
for example

2570
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,679
in the um

2571
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,760
before we are focusing on training

2572
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,239
running but nowadays we are

2573
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:25,520
focusing on implants prediction so if we

2574
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,480
think about the implants on not only

2575
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,040
high performance server but also small

2576
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,679
hardware micro controller for

2577
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,960
performance cpu and ai chipset the

2578
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,080
optimal target device the reason is the

2579
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,040
cost

2580
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,119
so if you utilize the high performance

2581
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,239
server okay it is good but the cost is

2582
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,760
very high so if you think about the cost

2583
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,239
we are also think about the raw

2584
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:55,199
performance the hardware

2585
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,760
so if you think about configuring of the

2586
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,800
system in terms of ai influences

2587
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,920
services

2588
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,360
then

2589
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,239
you consider

2590
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,440
better kind of things for example

2591
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,159
if you think about training then the

2592
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:15,520
main point is to accuracy of the model

2593
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,080
but if you think about the influence you

2594
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,719
consider which is the target device for

2595
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:21,840
example

2596
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,679
it can be local device

2597
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,560
hd device and cloud server

2598
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,960
and if you find or if you charge the

2599
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,719
objective the

2600
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,880
system then you can

2601
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,280
consider and you can adjust the

2602
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,080
objectives for example accuracy

2603
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,679
and latency

2604
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,159
and their top three peak

2605
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:45,440
and resource utilization etc

2606
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,080
so uh in this document we show some

2607
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,960
conclusion of system for example ai

2608
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,400
model

2609
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,040
if we think about air mode there are a

2610
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:58,320
very kind of the air model for example

2611
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:02,000
um heavy and very uh

2612
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,639
size of the air model it

2613
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,400
represents the high accuracy of the

2614
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,520
model but in some point you can think

2615
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,480
about the lightweight air mode the model

2616
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,560
size is very small and the influence

2617
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,239
time is very short

2618
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,080
there are problems and cones

2619
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,960
and also another configuration is the

2620
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,199
serving framework

2621
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:26,480
okay you can utilize the web framework

2622
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:30,000
to provide ai services but nowadays for

2623
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,600
example tensorflow serving purchaser

2624
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,760
that is the targeting

2625
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,080
framework for

2626
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,119
implement system so you can utilize

2627
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,960
ai or web framework or specific solving

2628
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,600
primal and communication method for

2629
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,560
example

2630
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,239
rest where you can utilize gel pc and

2631
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:55,440
design or device capacity for example

2632
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,400
cpu

2633
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,719
length or the capacity of network

2634
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,920
interfaces and influence data

2635
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,199
so the main reason is to of this

2636
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:08,159
document is to x-ray the study air issue

2637
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:11,679
in the nmrg and irtf okay next case

2638
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,000
please

2639
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,199
yes this is a genetic procedure of ai

2640
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:18,560
services

2641
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,560
so i

2642
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,560
i know that many persons are very

2643
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,360
familiar of this genetic procedure

2644
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,119
the first

2645
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:30,800
step is to question and

2646
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,840
store data and the next step is analyze

2647
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,960
and pre process of data and the next

2648
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,480
time the next step is train air mode

2649
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,520
and another model is to deploy well

2650
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,159
impressed air modern and the final step

2651
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:49,440
is to monitor and maintain accuracy

2652
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,639
so

2653
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:51,760
by

2654
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,360
our

2655
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,320
the focus point is to let box the deploy

2656
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,920
air model and monitor maintain accuracy

2657
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,600
so if you think about

2658
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,719
each step for example collection store

2659
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,920
data and analytic pre-process data the

2660
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,199
device can be censored or db or

2661
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:12,719
assembled

2662
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,679
so if we collect the data

2663
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,199
the

2664
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:20,639
internet or network could be or used

2665
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:23,679
but in the train air model or analytic

2666
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,840
preprocess data then there are no

2667
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
connection with the network it can be

2668
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,520
done only local

2669
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,199
server local area but if we think about

2670
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,679
deploy or influence air model and

2671
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,040
monitor and maintain accuracy then i

2672
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,520
guess that there are something to do for

2673
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,760
the point of the internet for the point

2674
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,280
of network because uh we can utilize it

2675
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:51,679
we can deploy p system you know

2676
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,320
distributed approach okay next page

2677
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,639
please

2678
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,800
yes for example

2679
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,600
you can

2680
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,159
[Music]

2681
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,880
set up your network computation to

2682
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,000
provide a species the first figure is

2683
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,880
that it is only done in the local

2684
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,639
machine local server

2685
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,600
so the plant module for ai service

2686
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,440
request to the

2687
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,080
server module for air services it can be

2688
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,480
done in the same machine

2689
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,400
but if you divide this action

2690
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,040
in the second figure or

2691
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,960
you can

2692
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,159
put the server module ai services in the

2693
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,840
cloud server then you can

2694
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,639
ask to aisp to the server model in the

2695
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:41,679
cloud

2696
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,480
so in this case there's some network

2697
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,199
there are some communication issues

2698
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,480
and the third figure is to

2699
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:53,600
a important service on each device

2700
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,960
yes the second figure and set the third

2701
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,880
figure there are same and different

2702
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,159
point

2703
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,960
for example in the second figure the ai

2704
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,400
implant service

2705
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,119
on a cloud server that utilize the high

2706
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,000
performance server in a cloud but in the

2707
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,480
third figure ai implant service on each

2708
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,600
device

2709
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,679
they utilize a

2710
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:18,719
little light or small device in the edge

2711
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,119
network so it is the difference

2712
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,520
okay next page please

2713
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,159
also you can utilize

2714
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:29,040
at the same time cloud and edge device

2715
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,920
nowadays we call it the task offloading

2716
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,719
from the edge and cloud area okay next

2717
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,199
please please

2718
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:40,719
yeah this is our the main

2719
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,520
point of this contribution

2720
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,960
so until now if we think about ai

2721
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,840
services or a system the main objective

2722
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,239
is the accuracy of the model

2723
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,480
but if we think about cost while

2724
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,960
performance they're not only

2725
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,639
accuracy of a model

2726
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,679
but another point for example ratings of

2727
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,119
services where network therapy and

2728
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:08,000
resource utilization are also important

2729
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,520
point

2730
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,040
so to

2731
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,719
satisfy this objective of ai services

2732
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:17,360
when we must consider point is to air

2733
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,000
mode as i said that there are two or

2734
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,280
three

2735
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,159
kinds of the modem for example heavy air

2736
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:27,199
model or lightweight air model so if you

2737
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:31,600
use heavy air mode then accuracy

2738
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,280
is good but the ratings time is not good

2739
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,520
there are pros and cons

2740
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,800
and if we

2741
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,119
the second point is solving framework as

2742
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:44,239
i said there are two kinds of the

2743
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,520
serving primer then one is the web based

2744
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,920
serving frame up and the other is for

2745
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,040
serving targeted for example tensorflow

2746
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,800
serving word touch server

2747
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,440
yeah

2748
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,199
i think that the

2749
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,080
good

2750
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:02,880
uh

2751
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,080
solution is to using serving targeted

2752
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,440
serving framework but if you utilize

2753
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,840
serving target serving

2754
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,760
then there are some requirements for

2755
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,880
example

2756
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,040
high performance cpu or highest

2757
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,400
performance

2758
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,520
hardware so also there are problems and

2759
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,119
cones for regarding solving framework

2760
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:26,880
and the other consideration is

2761
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,280
communication method

2762
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,520
i know that many person are familiar to

2763
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,800
rest or grpc in the same

2764
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,960
in the ai system

2765
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,400
so if you utilize the little peak

2766
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,760
altera then it is better to utilize the

2767
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,360
grpc

2768
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,560
yeah

2769
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,239
and the other consideration is the

2770
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:52,800
machine capacity for example cpu ram

2771
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,639
network interface

2772
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:56,159
etc

2773
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,080
and the final construction is to

2774
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,360
influence data for example the data is

2775
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,760
through relative real-time where torpedo

2776
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,199
is ratio pitch water data is secure

2777
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,560
and

2778
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,800
well the data is non-secure

2779
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,280
so i think that there are other

2780
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,920
considerations to deploy air services

2781
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,280
but now we are finding this kind of

2782
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,560
configuration to implement ai system

2783
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,280
okay next please please

2784
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:28,000
i show you one example of a system for

2785
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,960
object detection services so

2786
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,000
i guess that this can be utilized to

2787
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,719
autonomous driving

2788
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,840
so in the left side it is the machine

2789
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,040
locating ai services and the right side

2790
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,159
is a more simple point air services

2791
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,880
yes you can utilize the two model in the

2792
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,040
same server where you can divide

2793
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,000
this model in a disability so the right

2794
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,679
module can be

2795
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,440
located in the

2796
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,199
server or edge etc so you can

2797
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,000
change it his configuration by

2798
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,080
changing your ip address or portal

2799
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,679
number

2800
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,800
okay next page please

2801
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,520
so in this case can you conclude in two

2802
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,639
minutes okay this is the last piece

2803
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:21,600
yes this is one of the

2804
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,000
experimental results of our object

2805
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,119
detection service in each services so

2806
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,360
as you can guess

2807
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,159
in

2808
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,719
the experiment in the cloud server is

2809
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:37,119
very good the everyday time is to

2810
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:40,000
zero to five seconds but

2811
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,639
uh the uh yes this is the reference time

2812
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,239
so

2813
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,400
the edge device is not good and the

2814
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,520
local device is also good so

2815
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,239
this is only one example of the latency

2816
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,560
but if you think about

2817
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,560
accuracy where

2818
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,760
the two

2819
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,239
well uh that thought what is your

2820
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:06,639
tradition you can many cases to combine

2821
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:07,520
but

2822
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,880
for example

2823
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,320
to consider which item is important okay

2824
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,719
next page please

2825
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:17,760
yeah so right now i want to ask some the

2826
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,800
movement because it is the first and the

2827
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,040
local version so it is the initial

2828
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,239
version so i hope in next or next

2829
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:29,199
meeting we will bring enhanced results

2830
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:30,639
and share

2831
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,199
our results and our understanding with

2832
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,159
yours and promote some of the activity

2833
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:40,839
in this animals so thank you

2834
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,280
thank you young

2835
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,840
so we have to move on and so for

2836
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,599
questions and comments will be offline

2837
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,080
thank you okay

2838
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,040
okay well i will give now um a quick

2839
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,960
update on the document about the

2840
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,800
research challenges

2841
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,639
of coupling ai and network management um

2842
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,480
so as you as you know it was before um

2843
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,560
shared a google document so these are

2844
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,760
already

2845
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,840
different iterations but here's a zero

2846
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,159
version of the uh

2847
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,840
of the draft so next slide please

2848
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,320
so basically what we have done so far uh

2849
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,560
we have of course uh

2850
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,000
transforming to the right format of

2851
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,800
course with the help of five

2852
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,080
key people that you have seen on the

2853
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,760
previous slide actually

2854
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,280
uh because at the beginning there are a

2855
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,719
lot of contributors that are listed in

2856
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,159
the acknowledgement of course but we

2857
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:40,159
need to to shorten the

2858
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,320
main editor team

2859
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,000
uh we

2860
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,520
of course we

2861
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,880
integrate different feedbacks that you

2862
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,960
already received or the previous version

2863
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,040
we changed a bit the the title as well

2864
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,360
also to include body let's say the two

2865
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,239
ways of ai m and track management

2866
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,159
and although we identify there are some

2867
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:59,760
challenges that you have identified to

2868
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,360
be important where there was no content

2869
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,679
and so we we had the content now

2870
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,040
next slide please

2871
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,719
uh so here are the major idiots so

2872
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,480
basically we had a new constraint

2873
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,440
regarding oh we can let's say um

2874
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,760
identify and what what characterize a

2875
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,840
difficult problem network management and

2876
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,280
what type of constraint and certain

2877
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,639
constraints is more characteristic was

2878
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:21,920
able to have more time efficient

2879
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,920
solutions that we extended to be

2880
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,840
more cost effective solution in general

2881
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,599
not only time efficient so

2882
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:29,599
all type of actually uh cost can include

2883
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,560
all the energy of course

2884
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,639
um we also extend the description of

2885
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,719
possible scenarios and uh yeah metroid

2886
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,000
that regarding challenges was we had

2887
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,400
these challenges to have the human uh in

2888
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,560
the loop or when using ai in in the

2889
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,840
context of transport management of

2890
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,880
course next slide please

2891
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:50,159
so you're just uh a summary of the uh of

2892
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:52,560
the current document uh of course you

2893
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,719
can see that there are these three main

2894
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,239
categories of challenges what first one

2895
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,480
is ai techniques for network management

2896
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,400
secondary network data is input for

2897
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,400
machine learning algorithm the last one

2898
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,800
is acceptability of ai so the free

2899
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,239
category sub challenges that you

2900
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,080
identify

2901
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,960
next slide please

2902
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,440
so what are the next steps so of course

2903
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,000
as it was already with a different

2904
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,639
iteration the document somehow is is

2905
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:19,920
quite mature

2906
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,840
uh but of course we also still need your

2907
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,599
feedback we've already identified some

2908
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,360
changes that you have to to to be done

2909
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,119
in particular regarding distributed ldi

2910
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:29,840
or call of duty and the integration of

2911
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,239
lightweight ai

2912
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:34,239
uh there are some discussion uh within

2913
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,920
let's say the idrt are about regarding

2914
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,840
to highlight a bit more the different

2915
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,080
types of problem regarding the the type

2916
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,440
of data in terms of

2917
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,760
labeled or unlabeled data knowing that

2918
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,040
maybe in network management we have more

2919
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,280
unlabeled data so that also some things

2920
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,880
that we have to keep in mind where are

2921
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,960
addressing uh let's say using ai in our

2922
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,920
domain

2923
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,360
there are some distribution of adding

2924
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:57,119
some legal or regulatory uh aspect

2925
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,960
with the use of ai

2926
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,800
uh of course again in the context of

2927
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,960
network management and networking

2928
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,880
and so now yes you are requesting your

2929
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,360
feedback uh maybe norm and the mailing

2930
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,560
list but of course we have some

2931
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,760
questions regarding the value of the

2932
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,360
document in general for the group for

2933
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,719
the community

2934
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:13,920
the program absolutely common do you

2935
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,520
think in terms of presenting the

2936
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,960
different challenges and what are the

2937
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,760
important uh challenges that maybe gaps

2938
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,560
uh is it right or not

2939
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,840
do we have missed something although

2940
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,440
this is very important first you say so

2941
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,360
we'll miss a very uh big challenge and

2942
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,960
also the granularity because it's hard

2943
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,480
to have something uh

2944
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,719
kind of exhaustive really the challenges

2945
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:33,760
to cover

2946
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,520
some everything but of course we don't

2947
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,000
want to to dig too much into a technical

2948
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,679
level again we don't to want something

2949
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,199
specific to use case or something like

2950
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,440
that should be

2951
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,480
and

2952
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,119
that's it for

2953
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,759
the time

2954
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,239
thomas clark from swisscom so first of

2955
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:56,000
all thank you very much for the document

2956
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,719
i think it's very important and uh

2957
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:00,560
speaking of the network operator who is

2958
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,199
collecting a large uh amount of data

2959
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,920
from the network and also developing

2960
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,480
anomaly detection like to give feedback

2961
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,599
on section 7 2 and 7 3.

2962
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,679
i recommend to do references on rfc 9232

2963
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,840
which is the network telemetry framework

2964
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,199
and especially

2965
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,320
uh

2966
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,800
describe a little bit uh regarding

2967
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,880
network data modeling

2968
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,239
and for the anomaly detection of aiml

2969
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,360
part i suggest with reference to the

2970
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:34,480
data mesh architecture which is nowadays

2971
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,840
currently being used in the industry

2972
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,639
and they're especially on source aligned

2973
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,639
data so preserving the

2974
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:44,880
the format from the network and also

2975
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,239
aggregates

2976
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,560
aggregates helps to reduce the amount of

2977
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,679
data

2978
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:50,480
and

2979
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,880
for machine learning and for ai and

2980
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,400
maybe also

2981
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,960
add a section on that especially when

2982
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,760
you do real-time processing of data not

2983
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,599
all the data is

2984
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:04,400
there at the same time so that imposes

2985
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,920
also challenges

2986
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,239
okay okay yeah so if you can just drop

2987
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:09,679
your email with the different references

2988
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,080
so it will be very perfect thanks a lot

2989
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,839
thank you that's it

2990
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,560
so now we have our uh last presentation

2991
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,400
of today which is a network measurement

2992
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,040
intent an ibn use case and i think the

2993
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,920
presenter will be kihan

2994
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,800
and hi cheers can you hear me

2995
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,000
yes

2996
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,400
ah thank you very much uh so since the

2997
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,040
last interim meeting we have started

2998
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,119
calling the the procedure of calling for

2999
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:46,719
adoption of the draft

3000
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,119
and we have received some valuable

3001
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:52,960
suggestions so next time please

3002
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,480
we received about a total of eight

3003
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,040
members agreed so many thanks to to you

3004
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,360
guys and we also received

3005
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,480
many valuable questions and suggestions

3006
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,480
so due to time limitation we will not

3007
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,920
cover all of them

3008
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,000
in this presentation we'll just take a

3009
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,960
few of them for for example and if you

3010
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,560
are interested in the drops you can read

3011
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,239
our updated version

3012
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:19,199
on data tracker so the first one uh

3013
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,599
first question is regarding about the

3014
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:24,320
sampling rate so the sampling rate will

3015
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,520
be

3016
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,880
constant or

3017
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,480
uh will be that will be constant or

3018
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,800
changeable due to different requirements

3019
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,360
and algorithms the second one is about

3020
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,159
the

3021
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,400
uh how to ensure that the environment

3022
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,679
resource meet the requirements so in our

3023
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,040
uh ibm

3024
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,560
ni system so the the uh the measurement

3025
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,480
result will be ensured by the closed

3026
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,880
loop verification the assessment module

3027
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,679
will

3028
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,639
uh determine if the result is acceptable

3029
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:55,840
and

3030
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,159
give the feedback to the

3031
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:00,719
policy model to modify

3032
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,840
to modify the policies so next slide

3033
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,159
please

3034
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,719
and the third question is about the

3035
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,800
difference between static nmi and

3036
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,760
dynamic in mi so we have made a

3037
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,560
clarification on that on different terms

3038
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:21,599
so aesthetic aesthetic in mind means uh

3039
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:23,520
environment is independent of the

3040
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,760
network state let's say that we want to

3041
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,080
measure the network delay of the packet

3042
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,880
and the the the ibncs will continuously

3043
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,520
sampling whenever the network behaves

3044
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,719
and

3045
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,199
but in contrast the dynamic means the

3046
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:39,040
measurement is corresponding to network

3047
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,199
state for example we

3048
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:44,000
want to measure the the network delay of

3049
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,719
the bidding time the ibm system will

3050
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:49,520
determine whenever the system is bidding

3051
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,080
and adaptively change the sampling rate

3052
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,960
when it detects a network state seems to

3053
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,239
to be busy and it will report reporters

3054
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:01,119
differently compared to static mmi so

3055
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:04,960
the last one last question is about uh

3056
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,960
it will it be uh

3057
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,080
about the the policy uh

3058
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:14,000
uh if it will be changeable uh so

3059
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,760
uh like the question two so uh our in

3060
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,599
our

3061
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:21,599
my system they the

3062
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:25,199
uh the policy execution will be on

3063
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,760
closed loop and uh it will be assessed

3064
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,880
to tell

3065
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,920
the

3066
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,119
uh policy module to modify the different

3067
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:37,440
policies so next slide please

3068
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:44,080
we also made some add some relative

3069
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,960
references to the draft and also we have

3070
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,719
modified the the

3071
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:51,280
figures and some

3072
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,920
improper writing problems and all of

3073
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,639
these has been updated in the drop so

3074
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:59,440
next time please

3075
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,560
so

3076
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,840
for the next types of the draft we we

3077
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,800
still want to say that

3078
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,679
these

3079
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,960
nmi drafts can be seen as one of the ibm

3080
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,239
use cases

3081
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:13,040
so

3082
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,880
if you have

3083
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,960
we are very welcome that if you have any

3084
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:23,440
uh good ideas uh uh on our draft or if

3085
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,239
if you have uh another separate ibm use

3086
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,239
cases we can

3087
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:29,679
we are

3088
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,199
open and uh help and very welcome to

3089
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,440
merge them into uh

3090
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:39,920
you know in into a total into a um into

3091
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:43,199
one single ibm use case draft so

3092
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:45,599
we we're looking forward to

3093
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,880
uh your comments and uh suggestions and

3094
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,880
thank you guys yeah

3095
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,280

thanks a lot kian for uh

3097
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,080
sticking to the time and also the

3098
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,800
consideration that it gets quite late uh

3099
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,599
in your in your area so thanks everyone

3100
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,679
we are reaching the end of the

3101
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,400
meeting time today uh i think we covered

3102
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,920
a lot of topics

3103
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,480
i really encourage invite everyone to

3104
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,040
continue commenting um

3105
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,040
after the meeting if you meet each other

3106
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,719
but also using the mailing list or

3107
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,239
contact the different participants of

3108
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,159
the research group and this is also very

3109
02:00:22,159 --> 02:00:23,760
important to continue the activity in

3110
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,440
between meetings so thanks a lot

3111
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,199
everyone and enjoy the meeting and

3112
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:31,000
thanks for our remote presenters

3113
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:50,360
should be
