clear for the ones that we are remote

108
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120

agenda uh we have a compact but dense

110

agenda

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
starting with a few updates that we're

112
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,560

presentation on the ip parcels together

114
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,639
with some

115
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
other drafts

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
then we have the internet addressing

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
considerations follow-up from luigi

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
ayana considerations from don

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,919

120
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
service routing and multi-access edge

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,280
computing

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
from zongping

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
are there any questions or comments

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,758
regarding this agenda

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
okay hearing none

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,039
we can move on to the quick uh working

127
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
group updates

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
so the first one is we had this call for

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
uh working group adoption of draft

130
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,199
templin

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,280
interior parcels

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
we had a heavy discussion on the main

133
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,840
list but so far we're not seeing any

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,800
consensus to to adopt the draft

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
so

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
our plan is to continue this call for

137
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
adoption until the end of this meeting

138
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,160
since fred is going to present now

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
so we're going to be hearing uh one more

140
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
round of comments and

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
and then by the end of this week we can

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,639
close the call for adoption

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,039
and this presentation is following

144
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,199
uh it's going to be the first one so

145
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
that discussion can be

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
uh both at this meeting and over the

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
mailing list

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
the other update is

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
a network of networks

177
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,318
i'm standing on the x

178
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
like that

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
okay

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
the internet was intended as a network

181
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
of networks beginning in the 1970s the

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
arpanet grew to to become what we know

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
today as the global public internet one

184
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
of the first nodes on the arpanet was

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
the srivan the mobile node

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
sorry today's public internet

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
um sorry it's on the remote now it's a

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
little too loud it's uh it was actually

189
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,080
not bad before

190
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
is that better

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
yeah that here is perfect

192
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
so today's public internet is a single

193
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,960
monolithic grounding and addressing

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,879
domain instead of network of networks

195
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
it's because there's incomplete

196
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
architectural layering private intranets

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
connect to the internet via security

198
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
devices like firewalls proxies and ads

199
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
but they use address translation so that

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
there's no true end-to-end global

201
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
addressing

202
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
and internet working between private

203
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
internets is problem problematic due to

204
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,879
addressing the security

205
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
incompatibilities

206
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,840
and this complicates global mobile

207
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
internet working

208
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
but the early pioneers envisioned a true

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
end-to-end communications over a global

210
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
scale network of networks and they even

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
had a name for it they called it the cat

212
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
net name model for internet working

213
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,399
and i believe we're at a unique point in

214
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,760
history where the end to end can be

215
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,519
restored

216
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
next chart

217
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
so here's the cabinet model for internet

218
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
networking the figure that you see on

219
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
the right is the one originally drawn by

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
spin surf in 1978

221
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
it was documented in 48 which was the

222
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,519
precursor to the rfc series

223
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
i incorporated still earlier concepts

224
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
from leopos on beginning in 1974

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
and it envisioned a true network of

226
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,519
networks

227
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,200
they knew at that time that gateways

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
were required to interconnect diverse

229
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
internetworks but they did not know how

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
to traverse them

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
and they knew that end systems also

232
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,360
required a local gateway to support the

233
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
end to end

234
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
what they did not know at that time is

235
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
that they needed a new architectural

236
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,240
layer and that we called the adaptation

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
layer arrow and omni now provide an

238
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
adaptation layer for the internet

239
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
next chart

240
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
so here we have four

241
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
disjoint

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
internetworks

243
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
they might be for example large

244
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
corporate enterprise networks

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,959
uh

246
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,800
service provider networks

247
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
uh one could be the global public

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
internet itself the global ipv4 internet

249
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
another could be the global ipv6

250
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,839
internet

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,000
but they're in disjoint partitions

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
so next chart

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
so if we deploy gateways that operate at

254
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
the adaptation layer

255
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
we can now span these

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
disjoint partitions

257
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
next chart

258
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
and thereby have end-to-end

259
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
communications both within the same

260
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
partition and across partition

261
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
boundaries by using adaptation layer

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
forwarding over the gateways and over

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
partitions

264
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
next chart

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
so that what happens is an original ipv6

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
packet ending starting down in the

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
bottom left

268
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
becomes encapsulated in the adaptation

269
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
layer which is that orange encapsulation

270
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
that you see

271
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
then fragmented if necessary

272
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
and then encapsulated again as carrier

273
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
packets is what you see in this green

274
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,839
layer

275
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
the green carries the packets across the

276
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
individual segments

277
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
the orange carries the packets across

278
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
the adaptation layer gateways

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,279
and at the very far upper right you see

280
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
that the original packet then comes out

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
at the other end after

282
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,720
decapsulation and reassembly

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,839
next chart

284
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
so the omni adaptation layer uh it and

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
or near end systems configure an omni

286
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
interface which is essentially the same

287
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
thing as what the catnip model called

288
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
the local gateway

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
the omni adaptation layer source uses

290
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
ipv6 encapsulation fragmentation to

291
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
produce oil packets

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
and then uses l2 encapsulation to

293
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
produce carrier packets

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
the carrier packets transfers through oa

295
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,079
to the destination which reassembles and

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,519
decapsulates

297
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
and the source can tune its packet sizes

298
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
without loss to achieve the best

299
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,399
performance

300
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
it's very similar to atm adaptation

301
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
layer 5.

302
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,199
next chart

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
so in terms of multi-net traversal we

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
have these things in the middle called

305
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
ol gateways

306
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
here again the original source and final

307
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,760
destination are in different internet

308
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,959
segments

309
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
the ol source produces packets and

310
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
fragments and the old destination

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,079
reassembles

312
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,320
and the aol gate

313
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
gateways forward the ayl packets at a

314
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
layer below ip but all above the link

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,800
layer you can see where that bend in the

316
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,399
green graph there

317
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,800
happens at the adaptation layer and

318
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,839
below ip but above layer

319
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,600
two and the carry packets transport oil

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
for packets or fragments across

321
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
first top segments then undergo

322
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
re-encapsulation and re-transmission at

323
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
each next top segment

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
and this provides us the opportunity for

325
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
true end-to-end in the spirit of the

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
cabinet

327
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
next chart

328
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,480
so now let's talk about

329
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
aero omni and the six m's of modern

330
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
mobile internet working

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,519
the adaptation layer naturally

332
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,880
eliminates many challenges that

333
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
complicate diverse mobile internet and

334
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
service models incremental deployment on

335
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,800
existing networks there's no need for a

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
flag day

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
security is addressed at all layers in

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
the architecture including end-to-end

339
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
it naturally supports dtn

340
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
and the 6ms that i'm talking about are

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,639
multi-link multi-net mobility

342
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
multicast multi-hop and mtu assurance

343
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
and all six of them deserve a 30-minute

344
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
time slide in their own but i'm not

345
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
going to talk about all six today

346
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
just understand that they're very

347
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
important

348
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
but what i am going to talk about is mtu

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,399
assurance the ability for mobile nodes

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,800
to send packets of diverse sizes without

351
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
loss

352
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
and to dynamically tune packet sizes for

353
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
best performance

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
and it's inspired a new construct that's

355
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
known as the ip parcel

356
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,079
next chart

357
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
ip packets of both of ipv6 forward ipv6

358
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
contain a unit of data that becomes the

359
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
re-transmission unit in case of loss

360
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
upper layer protocols such as tcp quick

361
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,959
udp ltp udp

362
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
exchange segments

363
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,240
and with a single segment per ip packet

364
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
but i p parcels permit a single packet

365
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
to carry multiple upper layer protocol

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,440
segments

367
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
as a packet of packets

368
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,680
but the segment is still the lost

369
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
transmission unit

370
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
the goal is to support larger packets

371
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,680
for better performance

372
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
flexible packaging repackaging for more

373
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
efficient handling and to encourage more

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
diverse maximum transmission units in

375
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,638
the internet

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
next chart

377
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
so as an analogy when a consumer orders

378
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
50 small items from a major online

379
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
retailer the retailer doesn't ship them

380
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
in 50 small separate small boxes

381
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,959
instead they put as many of the small

382
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
items as possible into one or a few

383
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
larger boxes or parcels

384
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,079
and then they place the parcels on a

385
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
semi truck or an airplane the parcels

386
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
arrive at a regional distribution center

387
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
where they may be further redistributed

388
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
into different size parcels that are

389
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
finally delivered to the consumer

390
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,839
but most often the consumer will only

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
find one or a few parcels at their

392
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
doorstep and not 15 individual boxes

393
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
and this greatly reduces handling

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
overhead for both the retailer and the

395
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,000
consumer

396
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
next chart

397
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,160
ip parcels are formed

398
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
by

399
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
putting together segments that come from

400
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
the same upper layer protocol 5 tuple

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,040
being the source address destination

402
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,639
address source port destination port and

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,839
protocol

404
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
to produce buffers with up to 64

405
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
segments all concatenated together

406
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
all segments except the final segment

407
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,959
must be equal length they can be up to

408
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
65k octets 64k octets minus the length

409
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
of the headers

410
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
the final segment may be smaller

411
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
and the upper layer protocol

412
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,720
delivers the data buffer and non-final

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,800
segment size to the ip layer

414
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
and from there the ip layer forms

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
parcels by appending jumbo a jumbo

416
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
payload option

417
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
uh it's the same jumbo payload option

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,920
that appears in rsc 2675.

419
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,839
next

420
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,639
chart

421
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
so ip parcels are based on ip jumbograms

422
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,320
ip parcels use the jumbo payload option

423
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
with a non-zero total payload length

424
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
whereas true jumbos use zero for that

425
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,000
field

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
the total payload length encodes the

427
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
length of the first segment only

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
and the jumbo payload length includes

429
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
the length of the entire parcel

430
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
ip parcels are defined for both ipv6 and

431
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
ipv4

432
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
for ipv4

433
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
we're proposing to reuse the obsoleted

434
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,959
rfc 1063 ipv4 probe mtu option

435
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
and the maximum ip parcel size therefore

436
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,320
is a little bit less than 64k times 64

437
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,839
times 64k or or 4

438
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,399
megabytes

439
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
next chart

440
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,040
so

441
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
here's what they look like ip parcel

442
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,759
structure

443
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,880
it supports both tcp and transports over

444
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
udp

445
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,320
they include up to 64 upper layer

446
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
protocol segments but only one tcp or

447
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
udp ip header

448
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,440
and the tcp udp checksum covers only the

449
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
headers

450
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
with an individual trailer for each

451
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
segment

452
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
all set all checksums are calculated in

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,839
a single pass over the

454
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,639
data for tcp only each non-first segment

455
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
is appreciated for by a four octet

456
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
sequence number header

457
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
and udp transports encode their own star

458
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
delimiter in each segment therefore they

459
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
don't need the sequence number header

460
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
and these sequence number headers and

461
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
checksum trailers can be thought of as a

462
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,439
compressed tcp or udp header only have

463
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,880
to include that much information that

464
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
would normally appear in the tcp header

465
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
and then you can put all these items

466
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
together as a single parcel

467
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
next chart

468
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,240
a transmission of ip parcels

469
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
ip parcels travel traverse parcel

470
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,559
capable links with sufficient mtu the

471
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
same as packets partial capable physical

472
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,120
links are not yet available but omni

473
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
virtual links can forward ip parcels

474
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
using the adaptation layer today

475
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
the omni adaptation layer uses

476
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
encapsulation and fragmentation to break

477
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
large parcels into smaller sub-parcels

478
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
if necessary

479
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
since the largest that can undergo ip

480
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,520
fragmentation is 64k

481
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
in the first pass we have parcel

482
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
fragmentation which is accompanied by

483
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
loose reassembly with opportunistic

484
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
merging

485
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
in the second pass we have ip

486
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
fragmentation which has strict

487
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
reassembly with fragment retransmission

488
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
but the goal is to forward the fewest

489
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
and largest ip parcels possible over the

490
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,960
network to the final destination

491
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
to minimize segment reordering due to

492
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
parts reparcel if possible although

493
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
that's not critical

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
we leverage ip fragmentation reassemble

495
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
if necessary

496
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
and the lost unit is a single segment

497
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,120
instead of the entire parcel

498
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,679
so

499
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,600
before we start sending parcels we have

500
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
to qualify the path to see if the path

501
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
is capable of supporting them

502
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
so we have this partial path

503
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
qualification procedure

504
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
we have a partial probe from sources

505
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
test consecutive hops up to the

506
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,360
destination or a router with a nine

507
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
parcel capable next op

508
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
and this is done by using a hot buy hops

509
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,480
option that's processed at each hop

510
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
and then the destination or the router

511
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
informs the source that some of the all

512
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,080
of the forward path is possible capable

513
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
by sending a partial reply

514
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
and for this we use udpip encapsulated

515
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
icmp messages that are processed only at

516
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
the source

517
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,280
but after a partial path qualification

518
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
parcels from source traverse partially

519
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,799
capable past the same as ordinary ip

520
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
packets up to the destination router

521
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
destinations that receive parcels can

522
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,919
effectively deliver them to upper layers

523
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,520
and router routers that terminate

524
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
partial capable paths open the parcels

525
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
and forward individual ip packets to the

526
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,400
destination

527
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
uh now this goes a long way of saying

528
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
why are we wanting to do this

529
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,840
i p partial integrity but

530
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,080
with link layer integrity checks like

531
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,039
crc 32 they can miss errors in packets

532
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,200
larger than about 9 kb

533
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
but ip parcels are often much larger

534
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
than that

535
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
ip parcels include separate integrity

536
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
checks for each upper layer protocol

537
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
segment

538
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
the parcels improve integrity compared

539
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
to same size packets or jumbograms which

540
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,160
only include a single upper layer

541
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
protocol segment integrity check

542
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,799
only segments with correct integrity are

543
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,520
accepted individual segments and not the

544
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
entire parcel is the last free

545
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
transmission unit and this is very

546
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,120
important because if you send a parcel

547
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
it has 50 items in it and only two are

548
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,080
corrupted you still get to accept all

549
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,400
the 48 other ones

550
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
so ip parcels now encourage new link

551
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,159
types with larger and more diverse mtus

552
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
plus improved integrity resulting in

553
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
major internet and performance

554
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
improvements and that's why the why of

555
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
doing ip parcels

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
and now we come to the question ip

557
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
parcels is ready for adoption as an

558
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
interior working group document

559
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,080
aero and omni are also ready for

560
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,440
adoption as interior working group

561
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,559
documents

562
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
can we adopt ip parcels

563
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,000
and can we adopt their own army

564
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
that's my chance

565
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
thank you fred

566
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
just a reminder

567
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,039
the area working group

568
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
initiated a call for adoption on june 22

569
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
and so far as jc mentioned

570
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
we haven't seen enough support to adopt

571
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
the draft

572
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,280
we have some time for questions

573
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
thanks fred it's ducard

574
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,039
um wondering wondering if you have

575
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
looked uh oh well affiliation in this

576
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
case critical technologies um

577
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,520
i wonder if you have looked at the

578
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,320
potential interactions of this with the

579
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,840
various tcp options the one that i care

580
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
about most is skips options

581
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,799
with tcp options they would appear only

582
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
in the tcp header of the first parcel

583
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
if it gets broken out into multiple

584
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
parcels they would still only appear in

585
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
the first parcel the other parcels

586
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
wouldn't carry the option and it's the

587
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,120
same thing same with the tcp act flag

588
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,200
the tcp act would only apply appear in

589
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
the first parcel not in all partial

590
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,158
subparcels after partialization

591
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,000
okay

592
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,799
no more questions

593
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
okay thank you fred

594
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,880
luigi please

595
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,600
i'm smaller than fred

596
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
okay um let's start so this is an

597
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
apparent update about the discussion

598
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
about internet addressing

599
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
uh we had two drafts in the in the past

600
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
named problem statement and gap analysis

601
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,640
now

602
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
as has being mentioned by sean carlos

603
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,360
the new update

604
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,080
she

605
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,039
changed the name to consideration

606
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
explain why next

607
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
so let me

608
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
put a little bit of context in the next

609
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,559
couple of slides to to recap what this

610
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,760
is all about next

611
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
so

612
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,000
this slide comes from actually itf 113

613
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
when we presented the update on both

614
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,039
documents the problem statement he

615
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
provides basically a scenario

616
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,039
that we have today in the internet um

617
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,840
where the the addressing model that we

618
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,039
have uh it can be a potential entrance

619
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
so

620
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
maybe sometimes

621
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,279
things can be done in a different way

622
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
then there was the second document the

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
gap analysis that

624
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
investigated a little bit more

625
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
uh about these scenarios and actually

626
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
also looking

627
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,279
what kind of extensions in in some areas

628
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,799
have been introduced in order to to go

629
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,960
beyond what was

630
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,640
looking like like uh

631
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
some limitations or shortcomings okay

632
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
um

633
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
we had a huge discussion on the mailing

634
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,679
list various mailing lists but mainly on

635
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,200
interior

636
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,679
uh started from a side meeting that we

637
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,240
did in ietf

638
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,039
112 okay and yeah we we we try to

639
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
capture all the input that we received

640
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,320
from the community

641
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,639
next

642
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
so i i think the animation that i put

643
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,360
don't work now but so you will see some

644
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
awkward bubble in

645
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,320
sometimes but so the conclusion uh

646
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,279
this is the last slide that we we showed

647
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
in 113

648
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
uh was the fact that we were uh

649
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
asking basically to have a

650
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960
adoption working group adoption

651
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
because we we felt that

652
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,600
while not finished this is a good

653
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,039
community effort and we also suggested

654
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
the fact that maybe we should start to

655
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,279
things

656
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,400
think

657
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,960
what's next i mean we we have some

658
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,480
considerations

659
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,960
so what should we do

660
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,279
with this okay

661
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,440
next

662
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,279
and

663
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
people listen

664
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,919
what was great in the sense that uh

665
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,200
the interior chairs were ready to issue

666
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,159
the the working group adoption okay but

667
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,640
in the meantime the iab and the isg

668
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
organized a retreat

669
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,360
they have usually to discuss various

670
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
things

671
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,400
okay but one of the discussion items in

672
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
their agenda and there is a snapshot

673
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
here was exactly about internet

674
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,240
addressing okay if you

675
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,960
did you if you go on the wiki of the iab

676
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
ist you can find the agenda and then

677
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,559
even the link to the slides okay

678
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,440
which i um

679
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,159
took the liberty to use a few of them

680
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
since they were public

681
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,279
i must have

682
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,919
handled this in a different way maybe i

683
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
apologize if i didn't

684
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
directly ask

685
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,480
isg to do that so but the blame is

686
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,159
completely me

687
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,120
and

688
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
next

689
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,640
so

690
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,120
uh in the next few slides you will see

691
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,000
this

692
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,960
except the hogwart bubbles

693
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,000
the slides can come from the iab ist

694
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
there is the link on each and every

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,880
slide

696
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,559
stating the source

697
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
and i would like to to ask eric to help

698
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,919
me to

699
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
set the context of each slides okay

700
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
thank you reggie so my name is eric

701
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,600
vince i'm the internet area director

702
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
and indeed those slides were prepared by

703
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
colleen perkins it's maybe in the on the

704
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,000
meeting right now

705
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,159
basically because we were seeing a

706
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,919
couple of drafts about this we sometimes

707
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
kind of hey colleen

708
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
nice that you were able to join us

709
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
we were wondering basically where what

710
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
was the intent

711
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,240
of uvg at this point of time so we reuse

712
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,600
basically the

713
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,000
the retreat to say those two documents

714
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,159
and that's what i wrote on the right

715
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,559
there are multiple authors

716
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,880
a little bit too much right too many

717
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,320
but it's okay including academic and you

718
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
are also ex-academic there

719
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
and there were basically multiple gaps

720
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,600
in those addresses it was a quick

721
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
summary of your draft basically on about

722
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,159
the length sometimes about the semantics

723
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,240
the confusion between locator and

724
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,000
anti-fire

725
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
which i think everyone will agree with

726
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,799
you

727
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,039
on this one except for the name of gaps

728
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,799
that's the reason why

729
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,720
i put there because it works right the

730
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,679
internet works and basically you were

731
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,880
the authors

732
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,799
were making this statement

733
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,279
and i don't disagree with and proposing

734
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,720
nothing

735
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
right to do and it was kind of puzzling

736
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
for us that's the context of this slide

737
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,640
exactly and um no i i

738
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
agree totally what you said it's cool

739
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,520
that you see that uh there are several

740
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
outers uh

741
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,320
yes

742
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
the use of caps maybe is not the right

743
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,200
working wording will come this is the

744
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
reason actually why there is a a change

745
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,679
of naming in the document and we'll talk

746
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,279
about this uh

747
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,960
i think in the next slide

748
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,440
no solution proposed this was absolutely

749
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,399
important

750
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,640
as we say in the

751
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
uh problem statement the document is

752
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
really

753
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,440
um

754
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,919
not about proposing specific solution

755
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
but as i put it in the awkward bubble is

756
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,440
i'm that stimulating discussion

757
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,120
okay so there was no intention to to

758
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,000
to go into the solution space or at

759
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
least not yet okay next

760
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
um

761
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
so coming back to the fact that the the

762
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,720
gap analysis um

763
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,919
uh

764
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,320
it's true that uh the feedback basically

765
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,760
as eric says that you use the word gap

766
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
looks like there is a real issue

767
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,600
and

768
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,880
you use a gap to to describe something

769
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,559
missing between

770
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
two things one is the current state the

771
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
other is the

772
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
proposed solution but we don't have the

773
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,120
second one so there is no gap uh

774
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,399
in that sense

775
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,520
um

776
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
and

777
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,320
we

778
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
while we did some effort not to to

779
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
present like there is an issue in the ip

780
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,279
addressing

781
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
or maybe we still use too much the word

782
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
in the issue in the previous version of

783
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,480
the document so

784
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
after discussion with eric and the

785
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,399
chairs we agreed that on the mailing

786
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,678
list that the the word consistent

787
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
sounds better okay and so that is why

788
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,279
there is the drafty and non-internet

789
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
addressing uh consideration okay

790
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,520
next

791
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
i mean um

792
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,760
would we tell us to go in all the

793
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,320
details in the changes that we did to

794
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
this document what you see here is just

795
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,159
the diff

796
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
uh between the old document and the new

797
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,919
the type of content already

798
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,880
shows that the word issue issues

799
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
disappeared

800
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,200
okay the point is not to to

801
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,000
and it has never been to say ipad

802
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
dressing is bad

803
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
it's good it it works perfectly

804
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,919
there are there are some scenarios where

805
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,519
um

806
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,600
some solutions have been developed to

807
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
overcome some limitation now the

808
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,840
question is can we do it in one

809
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,039
coherent way okay instead of have point

810
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,279
solution here and there that sometimes

811
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,840
may be incompatible and sometimes can

812
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,039
end up being introduced some kind of of

813
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
fragility okay

814
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,918
next

815
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,399
so

816
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,120
we

817
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,440
i asked eric to come back so that's

818
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
another slide from the retreat as luigi

819
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
kindly indicated at the below we were

820
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
really wondering

821
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
um what to do with those drafts or what

822
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,880
the best suggestions to move forward

823
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
with your work or there was about

824
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,159
creating a research group

825
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,080
making an ieb workshop just on this

826
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,120
topic

827
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
possibly creating a new working group or

828
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
keeping an interior

829
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
we were posing the questions there i got

830
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,360
some feedback from the iab and the isg

831
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,640
and uh

832
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
basically it was the third point that

833
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,480
was kind of selected or suggested as the

834
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,919
best way forward

835
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,880
okay so from from our perspective

836
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,559
i i mean i

837
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,120
we we we are these documents are not is

838
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
not about research pure research so we

839
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,480
don't feel that there is a place

840
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,080
uh uh

841
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
or better

842
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
we don't need to bring completely this

843
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,080
work

844
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,000
into irtf if there are uh research

845
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
aspects

846
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
related to this work certainly we can go

847
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,880
discuss to the various rg that cover

848
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
the topic obviously

849
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
ib workshop is up to iab would be

850
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,799
welcome obviously

851
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,320
so what i what we focused on is the the

852
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
the last two

853
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,960
possibilities next

854
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,880
but there is suresh on the queue

855
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
suresh

856
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
yeah thank you suresh krishnan so

857
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,240
uh keep in interior i i'm not really for

858
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
it right so interior is supposed to do

859
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,799
one of things right i mean i ask you to

860
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
make this comment after this the next

861
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,360
two slides because i'm tackling exactly

862
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,880
these points and

863
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
i'll call you back to the mic thanks

864
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,399
thanks you thanks suresh so

865
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,240
eric if you want to say anything on this

866
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
slide this is just the specific two

867
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,080
point new word yeah

868
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
exactly it is what basically what i

869
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,919
wrote as the benefit and

870
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,000
at first sight right the benefit and the

871
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
drawback of get creating a new working

872
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,960
group to work on this okay it is just

873
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
one detail is that they that are

874
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,919
mentioned

875
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,640
and arena i i suppose you guys discussed

876
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
also this uh

877
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
but uh yeah

878
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,600
other than that i mean this is the the

879
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,960
the

880
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,399
let's say

881
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,799
what should be done in order to go for a

882
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,519
new working group i mean uh there are we

883
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,919
know the procedure that there is we know

884
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,320
there is much work to be done and the

885
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640
community has to be there

886
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,440
okay this is a community decision

887
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
and something which is you were right so

888
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,119
sagan and raina

889
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
uh different topics are not really

890
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
related to this but we put in a retreat

891
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
in the same bucket so forget because it

892
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
was not linked to your draft

893
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,679
and

894
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,918
the incremental move is really what will

895
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,918
be important for the next step right we

896
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,560
don't want to invent a pv10 right

897
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
yes absolutely

898
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,918
so

899
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,199
um

900
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,159
the documents so far are not exhaustive

901
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,760
but cover

902
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,918
i think all the main areas

903
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,000
doesn't mean necessarily

904
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,960
that we we we

905
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
have to find a solution from each and

906
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,520
every area i mean this is something also

907
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,119
to be discussed and decided as a

908
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,399
community and

909
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,239
and uh to decide whether or not

910
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,719
something should exactly be done in the

911
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
different areas so

912
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,119
i mean as has been marketed let's not

913
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,839
boil the ocean let's focus on something

914
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,119
that makes sense okay

915
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,440
next

916
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
eric you want to say something this is

917
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
just the other slide on the in the area

918
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,760
is a

919
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
is an except of the the chartered but

920
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,480
which rightfully says

921
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,079
what should be done here is something

922
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,720
that doesn't fit in any working group in

923
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,520
the

924
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,240
internet area but is not

925
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
uh

926
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
let's say enough to

927
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
or was it to create a new

928
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,119
working group so

929
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,839
i think that if we go to the next slide

930
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,320
yeah this open the question whether or

931
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,560
not we consider that the discussion

932
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,119
about internet dressing

933
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,440
should be considered as

934
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,480
uh walls to be discussed in a larger

935
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
scope beyond the interior and so

936
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
considering if there is sufficient

937
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,839
energy and willingness

938
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,920
to explore the possibility of a working

939
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,880
group or the community feels that the

940
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,520
two documents that we have are a good

941
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
snapshot of the situation but there is

942
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,119
no willingness to go further at this

943
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
point in time

944
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,200
so

945
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,760
we are happy to have any possible

946
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,800
feedback we also set up a aside meeting

947
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,839
tomorrow early morning 8 o'clock

948
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,520
you are very welcome to

949
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,839
stop by and express your opinion because

950
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,800
yeah

951
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
we we need to have consensus to en

952
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,000
energy to move forward and suresh please

953
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,880
if you can come back

954
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
uh thank you luigi so i think um you

955
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
kind of got to my point of view so like

956
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,960
it's uh the interior is like as i said

957
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,119
like you know it's like chatted for

958
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,119
smaller work items right like you know

959
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,400
one-off things

960
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,560
and this seems to be like a large body

961
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,280
of work potentially so i think if you go

962
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,440
for a new working group or new rg like i

963
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
think that might be better and i say new

964
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,000
rg or like you know existing rg as well

965
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
as possible like you know for

966
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,599
like maybe

967
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,640
i don't know right like you know it

968
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,759
might be a home for it

969
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,599
the reason i'm waffling a little bit is

970
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,440
because it's not clear if the problem's

971
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
all understood and agreed upon right

972
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,480
like so it might take a little bit of

973
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
time before we get to a working group

974
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
and that's probably why

975
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
i think colin might be online so the

976
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
idea might be to kind of like solidify

977
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,119
the set of issues that need to get done

978
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
and the only concern i have is like is

979
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,000
to

980
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,440
kind of make this incrementally

981
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,520
deployable so like one thing we don't

982
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
want to do is like come up with another

983
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,359
clean slate solution and as long as

984
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,480
that's there like you know you're not

985
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
going to see me coming and

986
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,240
screaming at you so thanks

987
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,839
thank you sir i totally agree with you

988
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,240
in the sense that uh what

989
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,200
whatever will end up doing this must be

990
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
incrementally deployable and

991
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
also there is a work to be done on the

992
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
scope on what we want to do it's not

993
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,680
just oh let's let's revise the the

994
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,880
addressing model it's not that is

995
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
where

996
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,920
why where what are the areas where if we

997
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,359
do something

998
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,640
we get real benefits and how do we do it

999
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
in order to

1000
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,720
be incrementally deployable that's the

1001
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,560
the question so there is some some

1002
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,160
refinement work to be done on the scope

1003
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,480
and then solution space to be explored

1004
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,040
andrew camping um this might be a

1005
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,800
question for eric i guess which is uh if

1006
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,119
if the purpose of the iab is to provide

1007
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,240
long-term technical direction uh on

1008
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,839
the development of the internet i'm

1009
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
struggling to see why this wouldn't be a

1010
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
good subject for a future iab workshop

1011
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,160
as a way to flesh this out somewhat

1012
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,839
no

1013
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
i am on thecube oh yeah i know

1014
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
you were painting to me andrew

1015
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,560
ib workshops are managed by iab right

1016
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,520
clearly

1017
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,320
uh

1018
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
an outcome the site meeting i mean

1019
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
everything is in flux because honestly

1020
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,839
the problem is not well scoped right

1021
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,359
there's a reason why the assad meetings

1022
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,880
may be both later or maybe ib workshop

1023
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,359
so yeah everything is possibly open

1024
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,119
i understand it's not the answer you

1025
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,280
wanted but it is the case

1026
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,359
i might be do wrong but the the two

1027
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,760
things are not incompatible right if if

1028
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,520
there are side meetings and discussion

1029
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,359
doesn't prevent the iab to organize a

1030
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,560
workshop am i wrong

1031
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,640
joel halpern from erickson

1032
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,599
luigi i appreciate the goals and you've

1033
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,079
gotten in writing into this document you

1034
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,720
and i have talked about it yes

1035
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,040
but i can't figure out how to use this

1036
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,839
document as it currently lives as a

1037
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,320
basis for any discussion for what to do

1038
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,359
next

1039
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,079
the document mixes things that are done

1040
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
with things that have been proposed it

1041
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,640
mixes things which are done but work

1042
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,119
badly with things that are done and work

1043
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,079
well

1044
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,280
it mixes

1045
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,040
ideas that have been proposed that

1046
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,560
probably make sense and go in ip with

1047
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,240
things that are application layer and

1048
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,280
don't belong anywhere near this

1049
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,079
um i don't know how one would even put

1050
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,640
together either a charter or further

1051
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,319
discussions in this group without

1052
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,640
significantly more clarity in what it is

1053
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
we are actually talking about

1054
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,880
i mean if you want to publish it as a

1055
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
survey paper in sitcom

1056
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,960
hey

1057
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,200
you do good work but

1058
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,119
that's not what we do here at the ietf

1059
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,480
so

1060
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,160
thank you very much joel you have good

1061
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,520
points let me uh answer that um

1062
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,040
two things one is uh especially then the

1063
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
consideration

1064
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,240
document

1065
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,680
as we discussed by email

1066
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,359
could be better reorganized i and some

1067
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,200
some thoughts that are there are not

1068
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,359
clearly spelled so there is quite some

1069
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,480
work to be done uh but it's i i did

1070
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
really appreciate your review

1071
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
so this is one thing now on the fact

1072
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,160
that i cannot use these documents to to

1073
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,520
explore a solution to a chart or

1074
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
whatever

1075
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,839
so

1076
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,000
but because they were not written with

1077
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
that purpose in mind as i said in a in a

1078
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
few slides before the the point was to

1079
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,880
trigger discussion

1080
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,640
which is the reason i'm here right now

1081
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,800
if we do agree that there's something to

1082
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
be seen now

1083
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
we need to work in in

1084
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,200
in another direction and go exactly

1085
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,079
where you said uh try to transform these

1086
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,520
documents in something that can be used

1087
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
to structure

1088
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,800
a charter a discussion or something like

1089
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,880
that so there is work to be done in that

1090
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,480
direction i completely agree

1091
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,359
i think you have another question from

1092
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,759
colin

1093
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,839
for comments

1094
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,440
i have with the

1095
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,520
these drafts i think are very similar to

1096
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,760
the issue the issues joel just raised in

1097
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,200
that um

1098
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,599
that they seem incredibly

1099
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,359
broad

1100
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,960
um and there are some aspects of these

1101
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,480
drafts that that um

1102
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,280
we have had research groups in yrtf

1103
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,119
discussing related topics for several

1104
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,359
years now uh there are some aspects

1105
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
which are

1106
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,480
very straightforward um engineering

1107
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,200
extensions to existing protocols uh and

1108
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
there's the they cover the whole range

1109
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,240
in between them

1110
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,960
um and given the

1111
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,800
the breadth of the drafts it is very

1112
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,440
difficult to know where the work should

1113
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,280
go because the work doesn't seem to have

1114
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,319
a focus

1115
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,079
it doesn't seem to be

1116
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
so much research but you know or clearly

1117
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,000
research because it's covering about

1118
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
three or four different research groups

1119
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,119
it doesn't seem so much to be

1120
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,480
engineering

1121
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
it's not sure where it's going

1122
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
so i i would echo the previous comments

1123
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,119
if if if you can focus the work and you

1124
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,640
know decide whether you wish to do

1125
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,040
research if you wish to do engineering

1126
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,839
uh and focus it down on a specific topic

1127
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,520
i think you will find it easier to make

1128
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,200
progress

1129
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,359
or at least it's a definitive answer

1130
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,720
where progress should or shouldn't

1131
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,040
happen

1132
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,160
sure thank you uh thank you colleen

1133
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,599
that's a good

1134
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,640
comment

1135
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,440
is on the lines like joel said i

1136
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,240
i do agree that is broad

1137
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,920
again uh the reason is very simple we we

1138
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,599
try to to

1139
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,520
let's call it a bibliography as charles

1140
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,240
said we we went broad to see what what

1141
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
is going on doesn't mean we need to

1142
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,400
tackle each and every

1143
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,119
uh different area or different scenario

1144
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,839
etc etc so certainly there is a big work

1145
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,079
to be done in order to scope

1146
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,400
the the things and in which direction we

1147
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,560
want to go and

1148
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,040
might this change the venue um

1149
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,200
maybe maybe the the point at the

1150
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
beginning really was to

1151
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
trigger discussion not to to drive

1152
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,880
discussions that is why we went broad so

1153
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,000
that and everyone can have a say on this

1154
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,319
and we will continue to do in this way

1155
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,400
so and try to to

1156
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
set the priorities

1157
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,680
according to what the community feels

1158
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,720
are the priorities or the most promising

1159
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,000
direction to to explore so

1160
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,920
i uh what can i say i do agree there is

1161
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,000
a lot of clarity that is why we need

1162
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,319
more discussion as a my personal opinion

1163
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,480
thank you stu card and this time i'll

1164
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,280
say my affiliation is with ax enterprise

1165
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,560
so

1166
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,319
on the one hand i think this work is

1167
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,079
fundamentally important

1168
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,160
and i believe that having a venue in

1169
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,079
which these various issues can all be

1170
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,680
discussed at the same time in the same

1171
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,359
room is important

1172
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,000
because trying to tackle them one at a

1173
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,800
time

1174
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,760
um

1175
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,119
i don't think leads to the kind of

1176
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,119
solution that we ultimately will need

1177
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,920
um the sec the uh your section two in

1178
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,240
your draft lists eight different areas

1179
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
where issues exist and in the drone

1180
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,400
remote identification protocol working

1181
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,720
group we confront clearly at least four

1182
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,319
of those eight and arguably more of

1183
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,000
those

1184
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,560
so there is work in ietf going on that

1185
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,319
addresses you know some of them for a

1186
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,440
particular application area but so now

1187
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,280
coming to my question you probably

1188
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,640
covered this in your slides but i

1189
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,240
somehow missed it

1190
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,599
why i etf rather than i

1191
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,440
rtf

1192
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,000
so we documented all engineering efforts

1193
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,319
to to to to um to extend the addressing

1194
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,680
model and uh

1195
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,839
as colin pointed out and you can check

1196
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,920
it on the documents there are not that

1197
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,119
many research paper as a reference so we

1198
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,839
don't feel like that that

1199
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,880
there must

1200
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
we don't feel but

1201
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,160
again it's it's not been to decide we

1202
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,839
don't feel that uh

1203
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,800
building a new rg is worth it also

1204
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,240
because

1205
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,400
part of the the the things we cover in

1206
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,800
the documents are covered by existing

1207
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,760
research group also that we can discuss

1208
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,839
specific research aspects in in the

1209
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,280
existing uh research groups i think

1210
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,520
so that is the reason

1211
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,119
actually dino dino was first

1212
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,680
this is dino um

1213
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,920
so discussion is good i agree it's

1214
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,640
helpful especially face to face but you

1215
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
know at some point discuss you can

1216
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,160
discuss the depth and there's no

1217
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,280
progress

1218
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,920
what i would suggest in the discussions

1219
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,040
is

1220
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
maybe

1221
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,400
we see without out of the list of

1222
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,440
problems or potential problems let's see

1223
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,200
what people think about what's the most

1224
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,880
important single problem to solve

1225
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
like what address

1226
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
like what address problem what's wrong

1227
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
with ip addressing and everybody has

1228
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,839
their favorite

1229
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,480
problems wrong

1230
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,359
we can provide ex extensions there is

1231
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,520
nothing wrong with ip addressing it's

1232
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
just that in some scenarios we can

1233
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,440
provide extensions that are meaningful

1234
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,800
well all right somebody could say i love

1235
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
ip addressing but the way we do proxy

1236
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,920
aggregation in bgp is a problem maybe we

1237
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,119
should work on this problem because we

1238
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,640
think it's going to help service

1239
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,640
providers so that's what i would suggest

1240
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,400
is pick one problem and then we could

1241
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,720
focus and then it's succinct and it's

1242
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,000
described

1243
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,880
and then we then we could then explore

1244
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,440
exclu solutions that either change

1245
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,160
something or extend it i know changes uh

1246
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,839
you know and like you said an important

1247
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,240
requirement is compatibility so how much

1248
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,920
can you change to get a benefit and

1249
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,000
still keep it compatible in transition

1250
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,440
to it easy

1251
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,440
thank you you are making the points i i

1252
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
was willing to open tomorrow

1253
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,520
unless i'm making excellent thank you

1254
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,920
very much dina

1255
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,319
actually i think dino uh probably

1256
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,640
articulated it better than i could but

1257
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,720
but when focusing or if focusing on

1258
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
particular issues i really want to see

1259
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,559
more about what problems you're trying

1260
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,400
to solve specifically right so that's

1261
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,319
something that's quite um

1262
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,000
quite weak in the document it's kind of

1263
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,440
all over the place but a lot of people

1264
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,599
have said that already the other thing i

1265
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,400
would just say is um just a sort of

1266
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,319
caution about thinking

1267
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,839
about developing things that are too

1268
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,920
complex going forward so we're seeing

1269
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,599
quite a lot of protocol developments

1270
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,280
that are quite wide ranging at the

1271
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,800
moment and i would say you know if

1272
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
you're thinking about these specific

1273
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,040
solutions really have a one problem and

1274
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,960
one solution kind of thing

1275
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,520
um so that's just my feedback thank you

1276
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,880
please state your name

1277
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,839
oh sorry dominique lizansky and i work

1278
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,400
for lastpass legal thank you

1279
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,839
thank you

1280
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,200
yeah i do agree with the comment what

1281
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
can i say uh there is one thing i

1282
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,319
personally want to add i mean

1283
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,200
um

1284
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,480
there is nothing that is going to break

1285
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,200
we see that just there are in several

1286
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,000
places extensions that are developed in

1287
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,480
a kind of independent way the point is

1288
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
that just can we have something more

1289
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,319
coherent and bring it together so we

1290
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,720
have we have time to discuss and we have

1291
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
time to make the right

1292
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,119
choices i mean we don't are in a hurry

1293
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,680
so yes scope the problem what we want to

1294
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,240
solve we don't want to solve

1295
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,960
and

1296
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,880
how can we do it incrementally

1297
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,079
deployable etc etc so this is all part

1298
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
of of

1299
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,559
what is in front of us if we take the

1300
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,839
path of yeah discuss for for

1301
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,440
larger effort

1302
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,839
than just two documents in the interior

1303
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,440
one more question dino go ahead

1304
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,359
this is dino i don't want to be

1305
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,800
redundant but

1306
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
it's funny how if you just choose one

1307
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,720
specific problem that's well defined and

1308
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,760
try to solve it it ends up taking a life

1309
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,000
of its own and then it sprawls out into

1310
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,680
other things

1311
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,480
that then could be solved because you

1312
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,960
have a firm problem statement and a

1313
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,079
solution

1314
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,920
and so you know

1315
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
i mean i i always use rsvp as an example

1316
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,839
we needed a reservation protocol on the

1317
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,359
internet right and so rsvp was developed

1318
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,000
it was done in research in university

1319
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,839
and it did solve the problem it had

1320
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,160
limited deployment but then it turns out

1321
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,720
that sometime later people said hey

1322
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,359
rsvp might be a good protocol to do

1323
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,920
label binding in mpls and there's more

1324
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,839
deployment of

1325
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,599
than there is for the original problem

1326
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,240
statement so you see just going down the

1327
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,079
path of just picking one succinct

1328
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,160
problem and trying to solve it may

1329
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,760
develop into a solution that somebody

1330
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
says ah this is going to be good for you

1331
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,000
know holographic video in the future or

1332
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,079
whatever you know

1333
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,760
so you are basically saying we will

1334
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,440
develop something that will go beyond

1335
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,599
our expectations

1336
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,610
wonderful it's always the case right

1337
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:36,160
[Laughter]

1338
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,720
thanks dude

1339
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,040
okay thank you luigi thank you and feel

1340
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,640
free to continue the discussion on the

1341
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,359
interior mailing list for now okay thank

1342
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,000
you um our third presenter i don't see

1343
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,559
donald in the room

1344
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,599
so maybe we'll

1345
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,280
we'll jump to the force is zonk bank

1346
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,469
[Music]

1347
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,959
yes we can

1348
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,440
we

1349
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,480
we'll just give you control

1350
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,119
okay

1351
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,240
go ahead

1352
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,520
hello everyone i'm tong hando from china

1353
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,839
mobile

1354
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,119
and it's a the version one for this

1355
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,440
service routine in time you see

1356
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,720
the draft

1357
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,960
and uh

1358
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,599
next page please

1359
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,520
and this this page is about the

1360
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,720
modifications we add some sections that

1361
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,280
briefly analysis the service routine

1362
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
mechanism in mbc

1363
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
it's in including

1364
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,119
section 4 of the analysis requirement of

1365
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,680
service routing network notes

1366
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,520
including the following nodes in imc and

1367
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,839
the client and the server

1368
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,720
uh

1369
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,280
in the section file uh i'll be

1370
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,319
announcing the hash complex problem

1371
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,520
uh and in the section six we announced

1372
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,359
it's the service routine for

1373
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,920
the fixed clients and we make some other

1374
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,480
corrections

1375
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
next period

1376
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,960
and

1377
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,640
the we will

1378
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,520
reveal the mechanisms uh we think that

1379
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,800
traditionally

1380
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,319
uh the dns procedure will be needed when

1381
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,760
a ue user equipment access the local

1382
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,119
service in the uh mec

1383
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
in this document we introduce a

1384
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,839
mechanism that can access the local

1385
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,040
services

1386
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,839
in diamonds directly without the dns

1387
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,119
procedure by using a special

1388
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,880
special address

1389
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
in the picture we can see that

1390
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,359
when the ue want to access the local

1391
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,280
service they it will send since two

1392
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,800
attempt time one is a normal dns square

1393
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,000
to get the service id such as the

1394
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,440
www point local weather point

1395
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,319
com

1396
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,200
and the second attempt is to

1397
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,680
make a destination of ap address itself

1398
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,880
by hashing the domain name

1399
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,839
bypass the dns procedure

1400
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,480
if this attempt to succeed

1401
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,359
uh success uh the uee can access the

1402
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,480
service directly inside the ipc we think

1403
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,160
it will uh

1404
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,960
see

1405
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,160
it will be quick than the attempt one

1406
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,839
if if

1407
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,280
the time to success

1408
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,920
next page

1409
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,480
and then

1410
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,160
we here uh

1411
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,720
that is the service routine ip address

1412
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,280
we have several we think we have several

1413
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,040
options for the service loading ap

1414
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,920
address

1415
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
uh in the first option uh

1416
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,960
we we can assume that the uee can

1417
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,920
receive uh mec prefix for the service

1418
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,280
routine in the procedure of establishing

1419
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,680
the session between the oe and the upf

1420
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,000
in the mic

1421
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,040
then

1422
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,359
they can use the first

1423
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,200
uh for example 64

1424
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,400
64 for the mec prefix and

1425
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,599
64 for the hash domain name and in the

1426
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,799
second option we can use the uh

1427
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,280
your unique local address

1428
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,400
for the

1429
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,599
service routine ip address and also

1430
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,200
the first 64 for the prefix and

1431
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,319
the

1432
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,960
last 64 for the

1433
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,359
hashed domain name

1434
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,200
the procedure is similar to the first

1435
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,119
option

1436
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,000
and

1437
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,599
the imec

1438
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,000
ui prefix contains a special subnet id

1439
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,520
in the last option

1440
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,280
we can also use all the

1441
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,280
128 bits as a hash domain name

1442
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,160
and the finger shows

1443
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,799
next page please

1444
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,440
please thank you uh

1445
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,960
this is uh

1446
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,000
about the section four we analysis the

1447
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,920
requirement of service routine next

1448
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,839
workouts in the mec the network need

1449
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,839
need to support forwarding of the

1450
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,680
services routine ip

1451
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,079
and in the content server they should

1452
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,000
support the binding of the service

1453
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,760
routing ib under the traditional

1454
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,119
destination address ip we think that the

1455
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,760
value of service routing exists mainly

1456
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,920
in the period or establishing the

1457
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,359
connection

1458
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,280
and after the connection is as

1459
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,520
established we can use

1460
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,040
the normal ip

1461
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,680
normal destination address app instead

1462
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,720
next page please

1463
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,680
we also analysis the hash conflicts

1464
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,440
people and services

1465
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
we think that at the beginning we do not

1466
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,480
think that

1467
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,760
we were

1468
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
gonna have too many essential services

1469
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,200
that are requiring

1470
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,000
uh requires this uh ultimate yoga

1471
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,200
experience

1472
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,559
uh but if the mechanism is adapted badly

1473
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,160
and the completely

1474
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,799
exists between the hash domain names

1475
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,200
in diameter we can enable uh the

1476
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,880
mechanism that only on the most

1477
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,400
essential service

1478
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,440
or we can change the harsh algorithm

1479
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,599
that occur that is running on the client

1480
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,599
and the servers to make a better harsh

1481
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:56,880
redoubt

1482
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,240
uh

1483
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,599
we also

1484
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,640
think about several uh several solutions

1485
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,920
for this but it is open for discussion

1486
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,559
next page please

1487
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
this is the service routine for fixed

1488
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,359
accounts

1489
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,240
mmc can also support accessing

1490
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,040
fixed clients in this situation we also

1491
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,319
have a

1492
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,359
gateway

1493
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,680
the broadband network getaway at the

1494
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,319
gateway or client that can

1495
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,000
work similarly

1496
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,359
to the upf

1497
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,079
uh but uh we can see that a tunnel

1498
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,559
between the png and the imec may be

1499
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,880
needed because uh the upf uh

1500
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,240
pipes uh the the png is not in the imac

1501
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,400
and the i mean thc prefix can be

1502
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,319
obtained in the procedure or

1503
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:53,280
authentication of the client by the png

1504
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,280
we also think about that uh perhaps

1505
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,400
several mic may connect with the bngs so

1506
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,040
ability to make a decision about which

1507
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,200
i'm easy to connect

1508
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,240
in this situation they will also think

1509
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,040
uh

1510
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,160
the client will also send two

1511
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,280
attempts

1512
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,319
and if the time to success it will

1513
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,359
get access to a service more quickly

1514
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,480
and next page please

1515
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,799
oh that's all thank you uh thanks for

1516
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,799
listening and welcome for comments and

1517
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,319
contributions

1518
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,880
uh any questions

1519
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,799
thank you

1520
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,200
i think

1521
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,799
uh

1522
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,079
as an ntd as individual contributor

1523
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,319
honestly on this one

1524
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,640
i wonder why you post this draft

1525
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,119
interior for something which is more for

1526
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,799
me like

1527
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,200
v6 ops

1528
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,640
uh

1529
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,920
i

1530
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,970
i can also

1531
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,400
[Music]

1532
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,000
uh share it

1533
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,079
in other group i think but i think uh

1534
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,799
it it

1535
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,599
is also related to this

1536
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,799
entire

1537
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,440
working group

1538
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,400
uh i'm personally i'm not really sure

1539
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,559
that it's interior is the best place to

1540
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,280
discuss this

1541
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,119
uh we can continue discussion for sure

1542
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,040
okay thank you

1543
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,400
okay

1544
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,799
thank you

1545
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,040
eric again

1546
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,680
you have suggested a mechanism for mac

1547
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,280
and as far as i know mac is not

1548
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,599
developed in the atf

1549
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,520
but i guess in 3gpp

1550
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,200
so this should rather be directed to

1551
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,520
3gpp because it's no impact

1552
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,160
for us here

1553
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,720
thank you

1554
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,319
but i think we have used a different ip

1555
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,640
address

1556
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,799
it should

1557
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,880
be some agreement in itaf to use the

1558
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,680
address that way

1559
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,960
okay

1560
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,960
thank you i think

1561
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,440
donald is here now so we're waiting for

1562
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,599
you

1563
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,839
on time

1564
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,759
number three

1565
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,160
thank you

1566
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,760
okay

1567
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,079
hi i'm donald eastlake with uh future

1568
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,839
way technologies

1569
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,680
i'm going to talk about

1570
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,880
revision to rsc 7042

1571
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,680
which talks about iana considerations

1572
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,559
ietf protocol and documentation usage

1573
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,440
for ieee 802 parameters next slide

1574
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,680
please

1575
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,480
so it's this is part of a series of uh

1576
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,280
bcps have been two or three before

1577
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,359
and basically there's enough changes in

1578
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,400
the document

1579
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,559
seems to be generally better to replace

1580
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,559
it rather than try to do a bunch of

1581
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,520
updates that people have to correlate

1582
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,760
so it mostly concentrates on the ana

1583
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,160
considerations for these parameters

1584
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,440
particularly the

1585
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,160
parameters that are assigned by iana

1586
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,559
underneath the eno ui

1587
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,200
and i'll explain a bit what an oui is

1588
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,920
and from other blocks that have been uh

1589
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,920
allocated to iana by

1590
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,799
the ieee registration authority it's got

1591
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,640
some miscellaneous related information

1592
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,240
of one kind or another and

1593
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,920
just generally sort of explains to some

1594
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,160
extent what these 802 parameters are

1595
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,640
next slide

1596
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,599
so it uh includes

1597
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,680
uh sort of from previous versions and

1598
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,799
updates

1599
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,720
specs concerning assignment of mac

1600
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,839
addresses

1601
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,799
so the yana oui is zero zero zero zero

1602
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,720
five e hex

1603
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,039
so by virtue of having that

1604
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,599
organizationally unique identifier iana

1605
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,400
has the right to assign

1606
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,680
mac addresses

1607
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,520
that begin with that either with or

1608
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,440
without the multicast bid on which is

1609
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,079
the bottom bit of the first byte the way

1610
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,200
ietf writes things

1611
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,039
so those are the ranges that are shown

1612
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,280
here on this this slide

1613
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,599
uh they're both 48 and 64-bit mac

1614
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,079
addresses if you're wondering what uses

1615
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,720
64-bit mac addresses the three uses i'm

1616
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,440
aware of are

1617
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,200
802.154 which is zigbee

1618
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,559
firewires ieee 1394

1619
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,880
and infiniband

1620
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,480
uh

1621
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,680
just a for information di tripoli

1622
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,319
will sell you an oui if you need these

1623
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,640
blocks of addresses and under the ieee

1624
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,960
rules these sort of

1625
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,400
global

1626
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,240
mac addresses are only supposed to be

1627
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,799
used for hardware interfaces that is to

1628
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,200
say the concept is you'd be a nick

1629
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,799
manufacturer or something like that

1630
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,280
but the ieee will also sell you a for

1631
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,920
less money a longer prefix so that you

1632
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,280
have a smaller block of

1633
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,960
mac addresses because the number of bits

1634
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,160
you'd have available to assign is

1635
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,520
shorter at the end

1636
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,240
yana can also assign uh extended ether

1637
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,920
types they're called so the ether type

1638
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,559
88b7 hex is a magic ether type which

1639
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,400
means that it's

1640
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,880
to be followed by an oui and then you

1641
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,319
have two bytes

1642
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,480
so anybody with an oui can

1643
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,680
create up to uh to the 16th extended

1644
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,960
ether types

1645
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,280
and there's about half a dozen or so

1646
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,559
currently available

1647
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,799
currently assigned rather under the no

1648
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,799
ui indiana could assign more of them

1649
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,119
this document also mentions

1650
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,200
the address family numbers

1651
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,280
and the dns rr types that have been

1652
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,839
assigned for mac addresses next slide

1653
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,440
this version of the abyss

1654
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,640
terminal 42 bis adds a specification of

1655
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,680
cbor tags for mac addresses and ethernet

1656
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,839
protocol

1657
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,680
identifiers and adds information on the

1658
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,599
structured local address plan which i'll

1659
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,480
get

1660
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,359
give more details on and company ids

1661
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,599
she'll also give more details on and it

1662
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,920
has pointers to some other blocks of

1663
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,000
things that iana can assign there's

1664
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,720
continuity fault management code points

1665
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,039
that were allocated to yana and

1666
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,599
those are assigned as specified in rse

1667
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,599
7319

1668
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,039
and the registry is set up for what's

1669
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,480
called vendor specifically

1670
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,640
organizationally specific

1671
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,640
link local discovery protocol code

1672
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,920
points lldp is actually 802.1 a b

1673
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,039
and uh the rc 8520

1674
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,720
set up that registry and allocated one

1675
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,200
code point and uh there's

1676
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,240
uh a draft uh personal graph listed

1677
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,240
there which supposed to allocate a

1678
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,839
second code point

1679
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,079
and uh this uh seven to four two bits

1680
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,839
actually make some minor changes to

1681
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,359
bring that sort of in conformance to the

1682
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,480
way that

1683
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,799
rfc 7042 suggested that vendor-specific

1684
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,039
registries for code points under the

1685
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,440
anna oui should be structured

1686
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,680
and this this version also includes the

1687
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,720
iesg statement on requesting ether types

1688
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,640
it used to be that any etf working group

1689
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,400
could ask for an ether type from the

1690
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,799
ieee registration authority those

1691
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,119
requests have to go through the iesg now

1692
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,799
i'm not sure if the ieg would want their

1693
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,160
statement in this

1694
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,599
document but when came when it goes

1695
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,760
through the iesc i guess we'll find out

1696
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,520
uh or it'll be

1697
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,038
found out next slide please

1698
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,839
so uh

1699
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,480
there's a allocation procedure in here

1700
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,720
which is a little different uh mac

1701
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,319
addresses are pretty cheap we've got

1702
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,559
lots of them if you want one or two or

1703
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,839
four or something like that mac

1704
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,480
addresses unless it's a pretty bad use

1705
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,559
you probably ought to get it because

1706
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,240
you know we've got lots of them however

1707
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,599
it sometimes makes sense to allocate

1708
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,920
very large blocks of mac addresses

1709
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,760
example ipv4 multicast uses half of all

1710
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,880
of the

1711
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,920
available multicast 48-bit mac addresses

1712
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,559
under the iana oui

1713
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,200
and mpls multicast uses 1 8 of them so

1714
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,880
anyway for a small to medium-sized

1715
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,960
blocks there's this designated expert

1716
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,720
actually has two couple of them

1717
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,839
i'm the primary and there's a secondary

1718
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,319
uh that can disapprove or disapprove it

1719
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,640
if you want a really big block then the

1720
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,200
isg gets involved to

1721
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,920
eradify approval if the designated

1722
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,599
expert approves it the way it's

1723
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,119
currently written if you want a large

1724
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,440
block and the designated expert says no

1725
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,760
that's that's the end of it but if the

1726
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,440
designated expert approves it then it

1727
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,359
still has to get ratified by the iesg

1728
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,680
because of the impact on the available

1729
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,879
mac addresses next slide

1730
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,760
so what's this structured local address

1731
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,880
plan

1732
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
this is a 48-bit mac address shown here

1733
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,839
in the with the ietf uh bit ordering

1734
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,680
ieee tends to use the opposite bit

1735
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,439
ordering because of the

1736
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,359
physical order that bits are sent out on

1737
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,640
the the wire for uh ethernet

1738
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,198
so the the m bit there is the multicast

1739
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:27,279
bit and that's uh still

1740
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,880
unchanged from before if it's zero it's

1741
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,520
unicast if it's one it's multicast and

1742
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,439
it's also one of course if it's

1743
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,759
broadcast which is all bits on there's

1744
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,439
this x bit which is formerly the local

1745
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,839
bit and if it was zero it meant uh

1746
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,679
it's a global unique

1747
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,080
address which is still true and it used

1748
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,600
to be it was a one it meant just meant

1749
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,198
local and means the local network

1750
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,198
administrator had control over things

1751
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,719
but it's been renamed x and there's a

1752
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,799
couple more bits that now have effect

1753
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,479
because for various reasons i'll get

1754
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,799
into they decided that the local address

1755
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,319
space should be divided into four

1756
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,759
quadrants with

1757
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,839
and this is actually an optional split

1758
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,759
right now but it's the way things are

1759
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,359
going so i think it'll become somewhat

1760
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,439
less optional in the future

1761
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,000
next slide

1762
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,920
so here we go this is what the four

1763
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,719
quadrants are with the x bit of one

1764
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:15,520
uh

1765
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,759
the next two bits above that are zero

1766
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,000
zero it's just like current local up to

1767
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,960
the network local network administrator

1768
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,399
uh zero one is uh assigned to a cid

1769
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,560
holder i'll explain that in a sec one

1770
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,399
zero just sort of reserved obviously

1771
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,319
local network administrator can use that

1772
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,080
but you who knows they sort of reserve

1773
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,560
the right to assign some other

1774
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,799
use for that quadrant and one one is

1775
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,960
standard assigned which is intended to

1776
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,520
be assigned by a local dynamic mac

1777
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,920
address allocation protocol

1778
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,679
and this is basically to answer the need

1779
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,319
because of virtual machines and because

1780
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,120
of uh internet of things devices both of

1781
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,400
which can be

1782
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,120
quite numerous and dynamic uh

1783
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,719
it's a violation of the rules to use

1784
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,880
these globally unique mac addresses for

1785
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,400
that sort of thing so you just wanted

1786
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,920
some protocol to

1787
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,239
assign them locally and dynamically so i

1788
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,679
there's no reason for any this to be

1789
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,840
exclusively uh any particular protocol

1790
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,080
from any particular organization ieee

1791
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,199
has 82.1 cq there's a couple rfcs on how

1792
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,560
to do this

1793
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
so uh

1794
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,920
looking back at what what exactly is

1795
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
this oui so uis are represent

1796
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,320
organizations they're 24 bits they have

1797
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,520
the m bit 0 and the x bit 0. so that's

1798
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,960
great and if you have an oui you

1799
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,440
automatically have the right to assign

1800
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,239
uh

1801
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,480
a bunch of unicast and multicast

1802
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
globally unique mac addresses

1803
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,719
so there are people who need a company

1804
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,400
identification but they don't really

1805
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,640
need necessarily this block of globally

1806
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,640
unique mac addresses so that was the

1807
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,920
idea of the cid so it has the

1808
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,560
local the x bit a one and the y bit of

1809
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,120
one z bit of zero and that basically

1810
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,560
indicates that it's the top 24 bits are

1811
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,280
a company identifier and if

1812
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,960
this structured local address plan is in

1813
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,199
use on the local network then you also

1814
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,040
have

1815
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,040
mac addresses you can allocate

1816
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,679
locally this is somewhat similar to the

1817
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,120
ietf

1818
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,159
thing

1819
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,400
that used to be in rfc 2153 for ppp

1820
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,000
where there was a block of things which

1821
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,199
were called

1822
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,440
cf series ouis

1823
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,480
although

1824
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,920
i think this was somewhat the ietf

1825
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,560
stepping on the ieee's toes

1826
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,480
only about a half dozen i think were

1827
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,640
ever assigned in this series so those

1828
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,320
have

1829
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,960
all these m x y and z bits of one and

1830
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,440
the multicast bit is meaningless for the

1831
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,159
use that it was originally intended for

1832
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,400
uh so that's use that that's been

1833
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,000
deprecated

1834
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,960
um

1835
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,880
and the only other funny thing is

1836
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,080
interesting is that ipv6 multicast

1837
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,920
has always been defined to use mac

1838
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,719
addresses with the top byte being 33

1839
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:57,920
which actually falls into this

1840
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,239
administratively assigned quadrant and

1841
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,679
it's interesting i if i mention this to

1842
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,360
some people in 802 who have never heard

1843
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,840
of this they say that's terrible you

1844
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,159
know this is camping on stuff that

1845
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,400
belongs to us and the ietf should fix

1846
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,239
that of course it's built baked into

1847
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,760
hardware and has been for many many

1848
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,280
years and i talked to other people who

1849
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,960
say oh yeah we knew about that we talked

1850
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,800
to them at the time it's okay

1851
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,840
so

1852
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,840
anyway uh next slide

1853
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,400
so there's also some stuff in here it

1854
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,560
adds some documentation an example code

1855
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,080
points where there weren't before the

1856
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,480
two rfc sites cited there are just rfcs

1857
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,880
that explain why it's a good idea to

1858
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,120
have documentation an example uh code

1859
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,760
points and there's you know it's just

1860
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,000
it's a the various clarifications in in

1861
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,840
the document and some minor changes from

1862
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,920
before that i didn't get to here i

1863
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,120
recommend you take a look at it if

1864
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,080
you're interested in this sort of thing

1865
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,480
so you can you can see what's there

1866
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,040
next slide

1867
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,159
so what should be done with this

1868
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,120
document uh i'm fine with it going

1869
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,280
through the interior working group

1870
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,400
or it could be ad sponsored

1871
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,320
thank you donald

1872
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,519
any question comment

1873
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,159
otherwise

1874
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,960
go ahead j.c

1875
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,880
thanks wassim um

1876
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,199
yeah i think uh this document makes a

1877
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,360
lot of sense uh and uh don i think you

1878
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,679
did a great job at uh

1879
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,920
encompassing and compiling all these

1880
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,960
latest events uh definitely you're you

1881
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,040
you participate very well and and i i

1882
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,400
triple eight or two and then you're well

1883
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,199
aware of all the latest and greatest

1884
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,960
um i i

1885
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,040
personally think that this makes sense

1886
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,880
to to be adopted in interior so that we

1887
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,719
can have some some more discussions and

1888
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,560
and perhaps add some more

1889
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,880
uh references if need be and then and

1890
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,120
have the group discussion

1891
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,920
so

1892
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,679
i think it would make sense to to get it

1893
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,800
adopted in interior

1894
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,440
thank you uh if anybody has any

1895
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,199
suggestions for additions or corrections

1896
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,600
or whatever happy to hear them

1897
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,440
carlos bernardos uc3m just a comment

1898
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,320
that we have rfc

1899
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,520
8948 that

1900
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,600
basically are extensions for dhcp to

1901
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,560
assign

1902
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,480
mac addresses considering the slap

1903
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,760
quadrants

1904
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,560
just for for you maybe it's uh i think i

1905
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,560
mentioned it here and i i don't remember

1906
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,920
whether it's mentioned in the draft

1907
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,520
right now or not okay i haven't checked

1908
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,560
the draft

1909
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,320
apologies but just as a potential

1910
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,080
reference that you may consider that's

1911
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,280
it that's my only question it's

1912
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,560
something that should be mentioned in

1913
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,960
the draft

1914
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,360
