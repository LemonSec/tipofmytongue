the big hand and the little hand are on

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,880

that it is now 20 hundred

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,480

uh

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,558
says

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
excuse me seth blank

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
and we are the co-chairs

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
here we go

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
our agenda for the day

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
some intro and admin stuff

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,920
uh and then we we go look at the issues

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
closure on the tree walk issue which i

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
hope we can get in a reasonable

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
reasonably short time here we've been

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,239
batting that around a lot on the mailing

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,320
list

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
an issue that i'm raising on how to talk

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
about mailing list interoperability in

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
uh

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
in the best spec

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
and then whatever other issues we have

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
todd has

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
one or two maybe

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
i think whatever it is will be quick

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
um and then discussion on the uh the two

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
reporting docs for whatever time we have

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
left and whether there's anything to

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
talk about on them we have a one-hour

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,559
session here

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
so we'll start with the administration

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
stuff with the slide with the very small

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,960
writing

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
if you are unfamiliar with any of it

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
please read up on it

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
you should be well familiar with it by

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,439
now i think

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,759

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
will enforce this make sure you sign on

51

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,239
queue by raising your hand in that tool

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,560

somewhere in the room there's probably

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
something to scan that

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
has a qr code

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,239

germs on the microphone

you want to add anything you want to

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
change

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
seeing nothing

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
let's get started

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,519
tree walk

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,879
is the text in version 14 which you've

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
obviously read through entirely because

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
todd posted it as long ago as last night

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
is the text there

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
what we want are there any other changes

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
needed we've been tweaking this

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
a little bit here and there so there uh

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
john do you think that the current

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
version

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,239
is correct

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,279
are there any other tweaks that you're

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,680
aware of

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,520
tim uh tim wisinski we're up to 15

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
and i posted the diff in the hedge dock

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
so folks can compare 13 to 15 to look at

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
the tree walk examples excellent thank

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
you so you're you're a virgin behind

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
barry sorry i'm a version behind i made

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,039
these slides yesterday so um

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
should we be using the version that was

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
just posted too recently to for people

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
to have read i i was going to i was

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,840
about to describe what the difference

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
was and sometimes john will take care of

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
that by telling you what's changed yes

123
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
the the only thing i changed was

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
the

125
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
there were there were a bunch of tree

126
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
walk examples the one

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
for

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
the one that used the psd was was

129
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,199
extremely simple so i made it slightly

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
more complicated so you now have mega

131
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
dot bank dot example and giant dot bank

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,919
dot example where bank dot example is a

133
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,520
ph it's a psd and mega bank has a dmarc

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,960
record and giant bank doesn't and it so

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
so one does a tree walk

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
yeah sorry so it does a tree walk up

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,280
from

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
mail.mega and finds it it's aligned and

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
then it does free walk up from

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
mail.giant and finds it is not aligned

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
because they're they're parallel under

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
the psd so i think

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
that is

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
i believe that is about as complicated a

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,880
psd example as as anywhere close to

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
reality and i think it and it points out

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
what it do what what what the psd flag

148
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
does it makes the pre-walk different so

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
i i think i think as far

150
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
and other than that we've had endless

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
discussions and nothing else i haven't

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
seen anything else that needs to change

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
i hope we're done

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
okay uh thanks john for the summary i i

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
agree from your description not having

156
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,240
read it myself but from your description

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
i agree that's the kind of example i was

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,639
looking for so thank you tim uh tim

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
wilsinski i agree with john i'd love

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
that example of his that complicated one

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
my only comment would be do we need like

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
a bad example like so in a lot of our

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
dna stocks we always have like this is

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
like not the thing to do right and we

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
show people like you know so and i'm

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
wondering if or if that's just going to

167
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,240
give people like bad ideas

168
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
so john back to you yeah having actually

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,639
gone through the ps

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
yeah it's working yeah having gone

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
through the psl to see what examples are

172
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
plausible i don't

173
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
i think it's very unlikely that anybody

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
would do a more complicated example

175
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
other than to make other than other than

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
to make some sort of point so i in this

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,880
particular case i

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
yeah i i i'm falling out on the side of

179
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
don't don't show the more complicated

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,479
stuff because they're unlikely to think

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
of it think about it otherwise and it's

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
and it would be a bad idea yeah and i

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,120
think tim that the the only thing

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
an example of what not to do would

185
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
probably be

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,479
just putting psd equals y when you

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,440
shouldn't

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
and i don't think we can really make an

189
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
example that shows that

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
so

191
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
yeah

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
seth

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
just re-reading everything in fine

194
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
detail this morning and i went back to

195
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
the original use cases we talked about

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
when we talked about the tree walk and i

197
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,000
think we may have something to discuss

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
that

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
is potentially a wrench but i think

200
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,759
there's

201
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,479
it has to do with the the

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
max depth of n

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
and the way it's currently written is

204
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
you jump

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,599
uh if the the number of labels is

206
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
greater than five you

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
blop off a bunch and move to the widest

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,639
labels

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,000
and the i think that's the cleanest way

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
to do it because you have a

211
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,560
very explicit determination at the end

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,479
of that you've you've

213
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,400
reached a tld if you've walked the whole

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
way you know there's no policy uh you

215
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
know you do not have to apply dmarc to

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
the message flow

217
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
i think the problem with that is the the

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
complex organization use case that was

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
one of the explicit reasons

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,639
for um the tree walk which is the

221
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
you know the federal government use case

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,120
uh than the university use case which is

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
i have sub-organizations within

224
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
sub-organizations

225
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
with complex sending um

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,799
environments and the dmarc reports jump

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
the person who can actually do something

228
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
about that so just to use a real example

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,880
right it's a

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,839
uh

231
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
right the u.s secret service right

232
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,839
uss.dhs.gov

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
and then they have

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
their own department under that and then

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
a sender and then a subdomain the

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
sender's

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
sending out under that

238
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
and in the

239
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
if it's more than five labels cut and

240
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
jump

241
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,519
we actually miss the use case of that

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
walking up to the appropriate department

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
same thing in a university with a math

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
department and some departments under it

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,720
and

246
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,360
if we just walk for five

247
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
and then stop

248
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
i think that actually solves the problem

249
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
but then it creates

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,360
a

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
a separate issue which is

252
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
right if you have the abuse use case of

253
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
a dot b dot c dot d dot e dot f dot dot

254
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
uh domain

255
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
um

256
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,360
you could walk through five say i'm done

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
but there could still be a dmark policy

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
then that you never get to that says

259
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
reject the message and so it's a lot

260
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,680
less clean and there's a there's a

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
trade-off there

262
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,760
but i am concerned about that the big

263
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
company with suborgs and suborgs which

264
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,839
was one of the explicit reasons we

265
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,360
talked about the tree walk in the first

266
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,160
place that we would cut off uh their

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
ability

268
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,640
sean

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
yeah this came up before and scott and i

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,480
talked about it and the reason we picked

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
five is because the the the deepest

272
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
label that has ever been in the psd is

273
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,240
only for the

274
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,519
the deepest name that has ever been in

275
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,440
the psl is only four

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
you know oh yeah i'm 100

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
aligned with five being the max

278
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
depth we walk and

279
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
completely really been through all the

280
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,240
data that that's sort of the most labels

281
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
the problem is from where right that's

282
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,160
the that's on the psg side on the how

283
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
many nest organizations no no no no no

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
no no

285
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
john means five from the right from the

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,199
root

287
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
the deepest label ever put in the psl is

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
four is four from the root which is why

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
we did five

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
right

291
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
okay and and the problem with with doing

292
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
in the other direction it's just it's

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,959
just what you said you put in a long

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
jump junk name and you heist you know

295
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
like

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
if

297
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
if people you know if you really believe

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
you can find a case where where you know

299
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
six labels would work better than five i

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
don't care if it's five or six or seven

301
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,160
as long as it's a small integer i mean i

302
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,370
just get just at this point

303
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,200
[Music]

304
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
more than five still seems awfully

305
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
hypothetical and and the thing is like i

306
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,959
know that i know these deep they're

307
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,880
these deep names inside organizations

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
but they tend not to but those deep

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
names tend not to be different

310
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
organizations they just tend to be a lot

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
of names within the same organization in

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,160
which case the jump doesn't hurt

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
murray

314
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
uh yeah two things if um if anybody i'm

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,000
i'm trying to plan ahead for when this

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
lands on my desk and i start working it

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
toward the isg if one of them asks why

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
five does the document have a good

319
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
answer for that

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
well it's that's the answer that murray

321
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,000
can give his colleagues the question is

322
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
should that be in the document right

323
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,560
so that the answer to that might be no

324
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
but i'm asking the question it will at

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,959
least go into the shepherd write-up but

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
okay

327
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
um i came up here with another question

328
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
oh yeah so and i'm glad tim's here

329
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
because he might be able to let's

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,399
simmer lane when we we get it and

331
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,079
someone says oh a tree walk that's

332
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,079
pretty weird did anybody talk to the dns

333
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
people about this

334
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
should should dns deer look at this

335
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,920
should we

336
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
so this can be a test case for the new

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,480
dns directorate the the new old dns

338
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,480
directory

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
was there are several people in the room

340
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
who are dns folks and uh and he said

341
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
sketchy ones but i i don't think you're

342
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
that sketchy

343
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
so it is being watched by the dns crowd

344
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,959
we count on you being sketchy

345
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
um so i'll just plan to send it to them

346
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,959
thanks

347
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,959
todd

348
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
uh first with with murray's question i

349
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
mean we can take an issue to add the

350
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
explanation as to why it was chosen as

351
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
five right

352
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
um but

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
the question is whether we should that's

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
uh it it might be adequate to just put

355
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
it in the shepherd right up so the isg

356
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
doesn't ask the question it's is there

357
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
value in an archival document to having

358
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
it documented there and i don't we'd

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,920
have to discuss that a bit more

360
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
but i i just want clarity on what seth

361
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
was

362
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,760
proposing because i don't i didn't hear

363
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,199
at least an early con earlier

364
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
conversation

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
can i speak yes sorry thank you i didn't

366
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
hear that he was asking to change from

367
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,279
five to six to seven i heard that he was

368
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,480
asking to not do a jump just

369
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
do five lookups starting with the

370
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,560
leftmost label and

371
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,800
you know

372
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
john if go ahead and go to the

373
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,959
microphone for it

374
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,399
i will have to look in the mail archive

375
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,839
but i i know i know we thought about

376
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
that and i i think we have a record of

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
why we decided not to

378
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
okay so we will resolve that offline um

379
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
ally

380
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,279
i i think

381
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
there are some little tweaks

382
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
that are actually needed because

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
was a change

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
the

385
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,320
algorithm

386
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
of how to find the

387
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
organizational domain

388
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
and

389
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
it is not foolproof the way it is

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
written and

391
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
some sentences look wrong

392
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,959
so maybe

393
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
we should have another round

394
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,880
of

395
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
possible changes

396
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,120
to propose to the working group

397
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,639
okay i i think at this point

398
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
if you think the that other changes are

399
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,199
needed that you the the right answer is

400
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
to post specific text that you want to

401
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
see changed

402
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
and um

403
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
then the the editors will consider that

404
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,639
tim tim wisinski i was actually starting

405
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,839
to think about who was going to do the

406
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,800
shepherds write up but i am offering to

407
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
write some texts for the shepherds

408
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,519
write-up

409
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,519
on the dns portion of it sort of thing

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,920
if that will actually help mr mr murray

411
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,959
the a.d

412
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,040
so okay okay

413
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
tim are you also just willing to be the

414
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
shepherd

415
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
i could probably shepherd this okay did

416
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,360
i shepherd psd i think no no no i

417
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560

[Laughter]

421
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,639
all right is there any other discussion

422
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,839
on the tree walk

423
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
no i wanted to just thank the editors

424
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
for the added example it made it very

425
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
clear um and so so thank you

426
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
yes i thank them too

427
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
okay well seeing no further discussion

428
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
on the tree walk i think just pending

429
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,519
the

430
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
uh resolving whether we need to say

431
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
something more about seth the issue seth

432
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
raised we're done

433
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
so um

434
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
john why don't you and seth sort out uh

435
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
offline seth's question and then we'll

436
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,920
go from there

437
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,320
all right later today or tomorrow

438
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,440

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,160
know whatever

440
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
john will be home tomorrow he can do it

441
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
so whatever it is you guys will sort it

442
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,440
out

443
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
uh report back to the mailing list when

444
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,759
it's done and now

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,800
the issue i wanted to raise

446
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
we have a little bit in section 8.5 that

447
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,520
mentions the uh the breakage we get in

448
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,359
mailing lists from

449
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,480
dmarc p equals reject policies

450
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,559
and the reference to rfc 6377 which we

451
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
published a while ago

452
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,480
is that enough

453
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
and

454
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
my view

455
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,720
now i'm i guess i should say this from

456
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
the floor mic but i don't really like

457
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
the jumping up and down as a participant

458
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,960
not as a chair

459
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
my view is that i don't feel

460
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,679
right putting this out as proposed

461
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
standard

462
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
with

463
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
something that blatantly breaks

464
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,640
long

465
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,280
a long time protocol that we've used on

466
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,799
the internet for dealing with mailing

467
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,840
lists

468
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,919
so i think that we need to make some

469
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,440
normative statement

470
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
that

471
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,960
dmarc p equals reject policies are not

472
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
intended to be used on domains that

473
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
that may

474
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
post to mailing lists and stuff like

475
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,919
that

476
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
uh the intent of p equals reject was for

477
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
transactional mail sorts of things not

478
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,640
for arbitrary people sending arbitrary

479
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
email to uh to places on the internet

480
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
i think we need to make such a statement

481
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,280
i prefer at a bcp 14 keyword level using

482
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
a should not

483
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
um so my proposal is to have something

484
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
in there saying that you should not use

485
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
p equals reject under these kinds of

486
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
circumstances and that it's intended for

487
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
this sort of use and we'd have to sort

488
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
out what the text is and i'd like to

489
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
start a discussion on that murray is the

490
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,639
first in the queue

491
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,360
so we talked about this a little bit

492
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
last night and i'm generally supportive

493
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,440
of using bcb14 to say this um

494
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
in the sense that i would also be

495
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
willing to defend it to the isg if they

496
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
say well this is you know if they resist

497
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
its use so i'm supportive of that

498
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
since we're talking about 6377 and since

499
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
that came out some number of years ago

500
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
is there anything in it that is stale

501
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
that we should consider commenting on

502
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,080
like

503
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
uh is is that still enough or do we need

504
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
to say more than than that has the has

505
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
the advice of 6377 evolved at all

506
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,480
i just wonder if it's an old reference

507
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
that we should update

508
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
okay pete

509
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
anyone want to answer these questions

510
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
well i think that i think it needs a

511
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
little more thought before

512
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
we give a knee-jerk answer and i'd have

513
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
to go look at it and see

514
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
uh pete resnick

515
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,480
uh i guess one question i would have

516
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
is given your framing

517
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,080
that

518
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
um

519
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,039
this particular behavior of p equals

520
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,400
reject

521
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,679
with

522
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,799
email

523
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,919
with the caveat that the email is

524
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
not transactional

525
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
will cause problems why is it not just a

526
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
must-not

527
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,320
it's an excellent question and you know

528
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,240
2119 is clear on this if it's going to

529
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
cause damage

530
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
and you know 2119 uses the the example

531
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
of you know lots of bad re-transmissions

532
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
but this is mail will bounce if you do

533
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,799
this

534
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
implementers need to be warned about

535
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,600
that you must not do it if these

536
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,640
conditions happen to be the case well

537
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,870
just i i have sympathy for that and

538
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,600
[Music]

539
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,720
what we often do in the ietf is um use

540
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
should not when we know that must not

541
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
will be ignored

542
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,799
or

543
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,799
when we think that it will be an um it

544
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,799
will be difficult to get consensus with

545
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,720
it and i've always sort of bristled at

546
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
that approach so i have some sympathy

547
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
for what pete just said uh something

548
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,799
else for us to discuss seth

549
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
go first

550
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,559
sorry go ahead

551
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,080
what you you oh why doesn't johnny first

552
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
oh okay john

553
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
mike

554
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
everything you say is right but i am

555
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,440
concerned that since pretty much every

556
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
mailing list in the world has

557
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
implemented various hacks to work around

558
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
dmarc breakage if we just say don't do

559
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
it we'll look stupid

560
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
so

561
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
or out of touch or like oh yeah that's

562
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
that's that's that's those that was ib

563
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
tower great ivory tower greybeards in

564
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
the ietf who don't know how the internet

565
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
actually works

566
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,880
so

567
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
you know i suppose we could say should

568
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
not and then the sentence after that

569
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,440
something a more tactful way of saying

570
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
but since you but since i know you're

571
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
going to do it anyway there are well

572
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,600
there are

573
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,720
there are

574
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
widely used workarounds which we're not

575
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
going to describe here

576
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
okay um

577
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,200
seth you are going to jump in first

578
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
sure i'll go after pete

579
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
so this pete resnick um

580
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
first of all i think john overstates the

581
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
case it is not that all mailing lists

582
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,559
solve this problem most now have hacked

583
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,440
around it but there are still some i

584
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
still get bounces

585
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
and

586
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
i think it is fair for the document to

587
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
say

588
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,320
there

589
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
are mailing lists many mailing lists

590
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
most mailing us i don't care which we

591
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
say

592
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,799
do

593
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
work around this by changing the from

594
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240
field in

595
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
ways that remove the original

596
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,080
information

597
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
but be absolutely clear that you're

598
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
removing the original information it is

599
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,960
a hack it is unnecessary if people

600
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
implemented it correctly

601
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,679
um

602
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,440
you know i i don't

603
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,919
object to more explanation

604
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
as to why it says must

605
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,320
or should not

606
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
um and i agree with you barry should not

607
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,559
when there is absolutely no explanation

608
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,760
for why

609
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,480
you

610
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,799
might do it the other way

611
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,679
reasonably is kind of just uh you know

612
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,960
yeah

613
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,919
um

614
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
but put in as much explanation of the

615
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,000
state of affairs as you like but the

616
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
instruction should be don't do that

617
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
yeah i put myself in the queue later to

618
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
say something similar but um seth let's

619
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
go ahead so i strongly disagree on the

620
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
tell people not to but i do agree

621
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
there's a very real

622
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
problem like i think we must address the

623
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,000
breakage and i think in the charter we

624
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,679
must address the breakage for this

625
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,360
document to move

626
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,960
and so as chair there there's a

627
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
there is something material

628
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
that we must have in the document about

629
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,360
the impact of dmarc on forward and mail

630
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,320
streams um with good guidance so i'm

631
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,360
strongly uh in agreement there as chair

632
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
as an individual

633
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,919
i think what we've seen as an ecosystem

634
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,720
um

635
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,919
mailing lists aside for a second is that

636
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,720
dmarc is valuable in an enormous number

637
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
of players and

638
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
the mailboxes all say we we desperately

639
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,039
want all mail to come with a dmarc

640
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,159
policy

641
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,200
um

642
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,279
specifically one that tells us how to

643
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,679
handle unauthenticated mail and so i

644
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
think we're doing a disservice that to

645
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
the the power and efficacy of the

646
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
standard by telling people not to use it

647
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
i do think if we can separate like if we

648
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,320
could if we could wave a magic wand say

649
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,279
arc is well deployed and the the forward

650
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
and mail case is used we wouldn't be uh

651
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
is managed we wouldn't be having this

652
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
conversation and my question is do we

653
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
need to dig into that

654
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,600
with ark and what's needed there two

655
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
materially complete this

656
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,000
or do we need to say hey

657
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
here's what we've done it's not yet

658
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
ready mailing lists could rewrite the

659
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
from i know that will piss off people

660
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
but there are options that address this

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
and then say and you should take if you

662
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,279
are moving to a policy of reject or

663
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
quarantine you should understand the

664
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,200
impact on any mail you said that goes

665
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,880
through forwarded channels

666
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,200
but it's not don't do it it's understand

667
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,559
what you're doing

668
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,279
and both the benefit of having dmarc and

669
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,760
the impact on forwarded mail streams but

670
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,679
i i'm very against as an individual uh

671
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,919
must not or i should not here because i

672
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
think the value and the whole point of

673
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,440
the protocol is to protect your domain

674
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,400
from spoofing

675
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,279
okay jim

676
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
hi jim benton

677
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
i strongly agree with pete's uh comment

678
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,120
um

679
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,279
uh to i forget who made it somebody's

680
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,279
earlier comment that ietf will look

681
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,520
stupid telling people not to use

682
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
something that we published before

683
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,559
uh i think much the opposite some of the

684
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
people who have deployed it dhs i'm

685
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
looking at you

686
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
or mandated it dhs i'm looking at you

687
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
are stupid for

688
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,039
mandating something that was an

689
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
informational uh

690
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,080
rfc and they should be

691
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
i mean maybe maybe we need to make it

692
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,200
clearer to people which which rfcs are

693
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,320
informational and which ones are

694
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
standard track but that got really far

695
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
along

696
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
became a federal government mandate to

697
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,039
publish p equals reject

698
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
and it shouldn't have happened

699
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,799
so uh ietf coming back and saying

700
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
what you did before was not the right

701
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,159
thing to do i think is the right

702
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,600
statement to make

703
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,640
so just before you sit down

704
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
i i believe that john's statement wasn't

705
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,360
along the line of you shouldn't have

706
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,880
implemented the

707
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
early version it's more that

708
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
he's basically saying we know that

709
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,679
people are finding value in demark the

710
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
way they're implement the way they've

711
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
deployed it and they're not going to

712
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,279
change so we would look stupid telling

713
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
them they must

714
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,480
john is that a pretty accurate so it's

715
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
it's more that that we we would be

716
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,080
saying something that we know they're

717
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
not going to pay attention to and that's

718
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,559
what would make us look silly well i in

719
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,559
fact i i think it should be a must not

720
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,159
because a lot of these organizations are

721
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,399
very compliance oriented and it should

722
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,480
not will not cause a compliance breakage

723
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,000
but it must not will

724
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
okay thank you

725
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,960
so i'm i'm in the queue next and

726
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,760
uh

727
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
perfect because i can respond to seth

728
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,840
again as a participant

729
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,320
i think

730
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,399
we're we're still acknowledging that

731
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
that demarc is important and that the

732
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,919
what we're just saying is that a strict

733
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,960
dmarc policy like p equals reject

734
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
was intended for a specific use case

735
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
and it's being used beyond that

736
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,880
the we know that no matter what we say

737
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,200
as john says no matter what we say

738
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
or some organizations will continue to

739
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
use it the way they are and will be

740
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
happy with the results they're getting

741
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,080
but i can't in good conscience approve

742
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,840
putting out a

743
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,559
proposed standard that breaks a major

744
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
protocol on the internet that we know

745
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,360
breaks a major protocol on the internet

746
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,679
and that asks every mailing list on

747
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,120
earth to work to put in a workaround

748
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,360
that avoids the breakage

749
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,679
so i think we need to say how the

750
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
protocol ought to work

751
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
and then accept that it's going to be

752
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,200
deployed in other ways by some because

753
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,919
we don't have i'm sorry i don't have uh

754
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,320
warren's little badge we don't have the

755
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,600
internet protocol police so that's

756
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,879
my response to that ali

757
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,919
i i

758
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,640
i think we must consider that

759
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,840
putting p equal none is almost

760
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,559
ineffective well it allows

761
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
people to get some reports

762
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,919
but

763
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,279
it is not

764
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,039
an actual use

765
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,320
of demarc protocol

766
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,039
and

767
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,080
on the other side

768
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
on the itf we do

769
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
most of our work

770
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,159
using mailing lists

771
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,919
and we are standardizing dmarc

772
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,679
without actually using it

773
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
it makes

774
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,200
makes me feel a little stupid as john

775
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
said

776
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,799
i think

777
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,320
mailing lists

778
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,559
can adapt as they do

779
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,360
and there are counter hacks that can

780
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,840
operate in order to put things back

781
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,399
the way they were

782
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,520
and solution will come but

783
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
saying that people must not use the mark

784
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,640
is a

785
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,960
it's not going to work is bad

786
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
in my opinion

787
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,080
thank you

788
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
i don't think anyone is saying we

789
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,159
shouldn't use dmarc and i will tell you

790
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,200
that as a mailing list administrator of

791
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,679
a number of ietf mailing lists

792
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,360
despite the work around that we've

793
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
deployed i'm still getting

794
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,720
every week

795
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
unsubscribed forced unsubscribed because

796
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
of this problem and that's with the

797
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
workaround in place so i'm not sure why

798
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
but there it is

799
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,000
uh braun

800
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
brown gondwana here definitely i think

801
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
we need to find a pathway for arc

802
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,919
there's at the moment there's no way as

803
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,360
an intermediate to know whether the

804
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,559
receiver

805
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,799
accepts arc i haven't been trying to

806
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
bring that work here just yet or find

807
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
someone who wants to do that work

808
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,360
because we're trying to get this stuff

809
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,480
done but i think that is probably the

810
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,760
next thing this working group will need

811
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
to look at i think it's probably going

812
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
to be a dns record

813
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,679
on the receiving mx to say

814
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,399
i i can handle arc so you don't need to

815
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,240
rewrite that looking at it i think

816
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,519
that's the only way that you could make

817
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,559
this work

818
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
realistically otherwise you're doing it

819
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,080
at smtp transaction time and by then

820
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
most places have already done the

821
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,440
processing their plannings do before

822
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080
they open their smtp transactions so it

823
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,720
there needs to be some way of knowing of

824
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,399
bootstrapping arc because at the moment

825
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,760
we have to wait for the whole world to

826
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,120
support it before we can switch off

827
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,240
rewriting

828
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
and that's not really viable do we have

829
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,880
any data from anyone who's implemented

830
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,600
arc i don't believe so there's not many

831
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,879
implementations out there yet

832
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,320
gmail has some we have some um

833
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
but there's not much there's not many

834
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,919
people doing arc in between and so

835
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,840
everyone's still rewriting

836
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,600
just jumping in for a second microsoft

837
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,159
just released a huge arc update recently

838
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,760
and so they're i think they're willing

839
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
to share a bunch of data i'm trying to

840
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
pull them over to the working group so

841
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
we should have data

842
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,159
yes i i have a suggestion about this

843
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,840
which is inspiring and john you're next

844
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,760
in the queue anyway so there you go so

845
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,919
inspired by what jim said

846
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
the problem is

847
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
calling it mailing list interoperability

848
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
misses the point

849
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,720
um the the i think the the problem what

850
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,440
the issue we need to point out is that

851
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
if you tell if you ask people to enforce

852
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,480
dmarc

853
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,559
some of your real mail will get lost

854
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
i mean the example i'm thinking of

855
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,919
is

856
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,600
um i host the mail from my town

857
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,799
government

858
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,840
and

859
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,600
i have a small enough mail server that i

860
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
actually look at the bounces from time

861
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,240
to time and i saw like you know they

862
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,080
were they were getting mail from the u.s

863
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,840
census in 2020 which was really

864
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,240
important for them it was it was p

865
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,519
equals reject

866
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,320
it it only used spf it did not have dkim

867
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,399
signatures and i forward their mail to

868
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
gmail which was of course rejecting it

869
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
all you know so i i think

870
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,960
rather than saying

871
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
don't use like rather than saying

872
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,200
basically rather than insulting people

873
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
rather than rather than implicitly

874
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
insulting people who you work arounds on

875
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,120
mailing lists i would phrase this to say

876
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
that the cost of using dmarc is that

877
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,200
some of you some of your legitimate mail

878
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
will get lost and perhaps slightly

879
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
anonymize the mailing list example in

880
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,880
the example i just gave you know and say

881
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,159
so be aware you know be

882
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,000
be aware of that if you decide if you

883
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,960
decide to

884
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,039
to enforce a policy and in some cases

885
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,919
such as mailing lists there may be there

886
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,760
there may be there may be

887
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,440
back end workarounds which are beyond

888
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,519
the scope of our discussion

889
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,919
yeah i think i think we can say that

890
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,880
sound reasonable and you'd be basically

891
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,519
we

892
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,039
we can say that without denying what

893
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,720
people do while still making it clear

894
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,399
that we that there is a problem and if

895
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,320
you just do this naively you may be

896
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
sorry

897
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,039
okay

898
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,600
pete

899
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,399
pete bresnik

900
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,918
people

901
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,119
always

902
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,800
misunderstand what 2119 words mean

903
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,839
we have voluntary standards in this

904
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,320
organization by saying must not again

905
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,800
there are no protocol police no one's

906
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
going to stop anybody from doing this

907
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
much less stop them from dorking with

908
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,679
their re-transmission timers in tcp

909
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,399
which they continue to do

910
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,879
the reason you say must not is because

911
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,079
you're saying

912
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,960
this will cause damage if some people

913
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,800
interpret that as a conformance

914
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,918
requirement

915
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,239
not our problem

916
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,800
and and god bless them if it does right

917
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,520
if they interpret it as oh the ietf said

918
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,480
i can't do that therefore i must stop

919
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,320
well they're silly but good let them

920
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,119
feel that way the reason we say these

921
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,760
things and standards is to explain

922
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
when you should

923
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,160
can

924
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
may

925
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,320
must do certain things to protect the

926
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,599
network

927
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
and what our must means in this

928
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,440
organization is if you

929
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
don't do this

930
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
damage will occur must not means if you

931
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,720
do this damage will occur

932
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,960
let's be clear about that i mean even

933
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
what seth pointed out which is we should

934
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
say that you know there are reasons you

935
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
might choose to do otherwise that is by

936
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,440
definition what 2119 says is should not

937
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,480
so if if we agree with what seth said

938
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,320
then we should use should not in the

939
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,520
document

940
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
i happen to think we can be stronger but

941
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,119
let's not try and

942
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,359
not use the tools that we have in this

943
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,760
organization because some people

944
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,680
might misunderstand them and then

945
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
therefore think we're silly i think

946
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,200
that's not a good reason to do that

947
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,160
trent

948
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,440
uh yeah um

949
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
so many points i wish i was in the room

950
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
to make because every one of the

951
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,920
speakers had something amazing to say um

952
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
speaking just to pete i i you know i

953
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,359
agree with that

954
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,760
i i think that setting the context at

955
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
the top

956
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,079
of the document and saying look this is

957
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599
the context

958
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,760
then the shoulds the musts and maze all

959
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,520
fall into place right

960
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,599
which means that if you want to employ

961
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,920
this and you want to use the

962
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,079
protections it provides

963
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,359
saying

964
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,880
saying must

965
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
is within that context right

966
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
so that's my number two is i really do

967
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
think that it's important that

968
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,280
you know in you know encounter to say

969
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,599
the dhs case i think it's important that

970
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,640
we do say you know you should do this

971
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,400
you must do this

972
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
in order to take advantage of the

973
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,880
protections that this specification

974
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
provides if you don't want the full

975
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
protections again back to what pe was

976
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,880
saying right you can you can make a

977
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
local policy that lessens that more

978
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,119
power to you but at the end of the day

979
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,240
if you want the protections that this

980
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,160
provides you say that and then something

981
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,839
else someone brought up

982
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
earlier about arc yeah we have a lot of

983
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,079
arc data that basically points out

984
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,320
that there are some use cases where it's

985
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
incredibly useful there's other use

986
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
cases where it's less useful we've seen

987
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,800
no use cases where it's harmful

988
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,839
so

989
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,880
you know and i

990
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
often decide we have these conversations

991
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,079
about how to employ arc as an identifier

992
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
in order to hang these things off of i

993
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,520
don't think it belongs in this document

994
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,240
but i'm happy to have folks ping me and

995
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
we can we can work on that

996
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,520
so my time at the mic

997
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,920
thanks trent and i will say that you uh

998
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
i feel like you are in the room with us

999
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,880
so

1000
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,960
all working victor

1001
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,800
uh victory

1002
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,160
um uh a disclaimer i neither publish nor

1003
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,400
consume dmarc so you can discount

1004
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
whatever i say based on that

1005
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
uh

1006
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,440
i do support uh the the must not i think

1007
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,680
it's a good idea i also hope the

1008
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,160
document contains somewhere a text that

1009
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
makes makes it clear to people that just

1010
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,800
publishing p equals reject isn't a

1011
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,200
silver bullet to protect them uh from

1012
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
all impersonation attacks

1013
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,440
uh you know just the other day you know

1014
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
my mother-in-law was reading an email

1015
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
and the display name said something

1016
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,480
about apple you know that's an email

1017
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,599
from apple

1018
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,400
uh

1019
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,359
so

1020
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,680
you know the the protection you get from

1021
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,320
p equals reject is rather limited in

1022
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,970
scope and so

1023
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,119
[Music]

1024
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,640
because of that

1025
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,520
if one has low value from it and expects

1026
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,280
too much from it when it's mostly doing

1027
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
a disservice doing so

1028
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
okay i so i'll have to channel elizabeth

1029
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
on that one and say that

1030
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,320
yes the organizations that are doing

1031
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,079
that are well aware of that but they

1032
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,359
find extremely high value in using p

1033
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,280
equals reject nevertheless

1034
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
uh what elizabeth told me one time was

1035
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
that uh

1036
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
it wasn't her decision and she wasn't

1037
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
happy with it but in

1038
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
looking at the results she would make

1039
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
the same decision if she had to make it

1040
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,040
because it's just been

1041
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,520
wonderful for them and they're all aware

1042
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,359
that that people are still getting

1043
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,040
fooled by look-alike domains and um and

1044
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
and pretty names and whatever else

1045
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
they're aware of it but uh i mean i

1046
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
guess you one of your points is write

1047
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,920
that in the document so it's clear

1048
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
i'm less worried about the organizations

1049
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,839
who really know what they're doing right

1050
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,040
understood

1051
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
and so yeah maybe we could put a little

1052
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
extra text in for that jim

1053
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
jim fenton again uh so some of you that

1054
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,440
are more operationally tied in than my

1055
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,720
tiny domain

1056
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,880
probably have more uh know more about

1057
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
this but i mean we've been talking as

1058
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
though the breakage problem is limited

1059
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
to mailing lists

1060
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,800
not entirely but right that's my point

1061
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
is it isn't entirely there are

1062
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
other situations i think there are

1063
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
instances of um

1064
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
recipient side forwarding alumni domains

1065
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
things of that sort where you run into a

1066
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
problem as well those are not something

1067
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,599
that the originating domain is

1068
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,680
necessarily even aware of

1069
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,960
and so

1070
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
we need to consider that

1071
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
you know telling telling the originating

1072
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
domain don't publish p equals reject

1073
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,599
if you're sending the mailing lists well

1074
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,400
that isn't enough

1075
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,359
yeah i'll get an anecdote the university

1076
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,160
of florida shut down their alumni domain

1077
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
because they were having too much

1078
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,960
trouble with uh dmarc

1079
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,560
but

1080
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,040
that's not something

1081
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
anyone any sender can control they you

1082
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,119
you give them an alumni address

1083
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,319
to use

1084
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,400
they use it and it doesn't get to you

1085
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
because of dmarc they have no control

1086
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,359
over that the one where they are using

1087
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
it on a domain where their users are

1088
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
regularly posting to email lists

1089
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
that they have control of and so that

1090
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
that was my angle on it anyway but

1091
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
okay so we've had a lot of discussion on

1092
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
it is there any further discussion

1093
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,800
for the room we'll obviously take it to

1094
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,839
the mailing list seth

1095
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,400
not to touch on the the other points and

1096
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,440
like the back and forth in the chat but

1097
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
i i think

1098
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,440
what i'm hearing is

1099
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
for mailing list interoperability what

1100
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,880
we have in the document is not enough

1101
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,560
and we do have to work out something in

1102
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,200
the list and the form it takes is up for

1103
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,680
discussion but that we

1104
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,599
must address this in the document is not

1105
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,440
for discussion we have to and it's not

1106
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
sufficient in its current state

1107
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
yes that's what i get also i'm seeing a

1108
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,000
lot of support for should not or must

1109
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,280
not um but

1110
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
we haven't completely addressed your

1111
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,200
concern about that yet so

1112
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,960
so yes there's plenty of discussion to

1113
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,280
be had

1114
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,920
anything else

1115
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,200
all right next topic um

1116
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,440
todd i'll i'll leave it to you here are

1117
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,359
there other issues you would like to

1118
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,800
discuss

1119
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
um and i'll just while he's getting up

1120
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,520
say that todd just moved over some

1121
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,720
issues that we we just shifted from

1122
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,680
um

1123
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,960
the older data tracker tracking to get

1124
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
github tracking

1125
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,440
so

1126
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,680
todd got to move a few issues over from

1127
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,440
the old system and uh go ahead

1128
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,960
uh todd hurt

1129
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,760
there

1130
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,040
i can't think of any issues that are

1131
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,560
currently in github

1132
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,960
that are open that need to be addressed

1133
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
there is one issue sort of burbling on

1134
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
the mailing list some reformatting

1135
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,119
rewording of section 4.8

1136
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
i believe uh scott answered my question

1137
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,640
about

1138
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,520
how the text should be rearranged so

1139
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,720
um

1140
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,079
we'll have to do

1141
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,920
you know the next the next raffle deal

1142
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,200
with that

1143
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,040
it sounds like we still have some tweaks

1144
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,880
to make to the tree walk yes john is

1145
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,000
that what we came out of the other

1146
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,440
discussion or no were we done with the

1147
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,200
tree walks no i think the only thing

1148
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,119
with tree walk was that john and seth

1149
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,720
were going to talk about the issue he

1150
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
raised and see if any text needed to be

1151
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
changed for that otherwise we think tree

1152
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,800
walk and the examples there with are are

1153
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
fine right

1154
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,119
so

1155
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,040
we'll have to propose some text for

1156
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,960
interoperability still and

1157
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
okay go from there but i can't think of

1158
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,800
any issues outstanding right now so we

1159
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,520
appear to be very close to

1160
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,960
finishing this victor

1161
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,920
uh

1162
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
since tree yuak was mentioned and i just

1163
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
read it i have a question more and more

1164
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,960
uh it seems that it goes all the way up

1165
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,359
to you know dot com which seems rather

1166
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,040
silly in some ways

1167
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
uh i imagine that's being discussed at

1168
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,400
length i'm curious

1169
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,680
and so john says if there are not

1170
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,240
already tlds with dmarc records there

1171
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,319
will be by the end of the year so we do

1172
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,119
need to go back to the team because

1173
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,560
realize.com may be silly but dot

1174
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
something else might not so

1175
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,680
tim

1176
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,760
tim was timothy talking about being

1177
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,319
complete what i wanted to point out was

1178
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,760
there's two parts in the security

1179
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
considerations section 10.3 and 10.4

1180
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,280
10.3 is on dns security that i hope the

1181
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,839
dns people like victor and wes and folks

1182
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,920
here we'll take a look at and what john

1183
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,760
wrote looked good um

1184
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,839
and 10.4 is display name attacks victor

1185
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,040
so 10.4 10.4 actually talks about

1186
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,880
display name attacks which is something

1187
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,119
you had just mentioned so you may want

1188
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,560
to look at that text and see if you can

1189
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,599
actually add

1190
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,800
some suggestions to that

1191
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
okay well i mean keeping in mind that

1192
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,880
when i say we're about done i mean we're

1193
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,119
about ready for the last rounds of

1194
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,240
reviews so yes that will all be included

1195
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,920
and we hope we will get a dns review

1196
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,680
or several dns reviews on it

1197
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,680
okay

1198
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,839
so i think we are done discussing this

1199
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,280
is there anything else we need to

1200
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,480
discuss about dmarc biss

1201
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,319
i thought you had there was a section

1202
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,839
here barry for

1203
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,520
any other

1204
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,040
knits and tim raised one in the chat in

1205
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,640
the middle of the last discussion just

1206
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,560
around um

1207
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,400
the iana registry for the psd flag

1208
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,280
uh tim filed an issue with that so um

1209
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,480
that will be covered by the last edits

1210
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,839
um uh alex

1211
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,800
okay uh al alex will take his issue to

1212
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,359
the mailing list

1213
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,520
um okay so now

1214
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,359
for whatever time we have left which

1215
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,480
appears to be about 15 minutes

1216
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
do we have any discussion on the

1217
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,160
reporting docs that needs to happen

1218
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,160
alex

1219
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
right just wait till you get to the mic

1220
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,920
uh alex brockman comcast uh editor for

1221
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
the aggregate document um so i've been

1222
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
kind of holding off waiting to see some

1223
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,359
of the changes through tree walk and

1224
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,480
some of that to see how that might

1225
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,079
impact the aggregate document that's

1226
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,400
what i expected yeah and so i i was

1227
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,680
talking with todd a little bit i don't

1228
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,160
think there's anything that is truly

1229
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,319
monumental that needs to be changed um

1230
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,160
but i'm certainly uh there are still

1231
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,680
some open tickets that need to be gone

1232
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,480
through

1233
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,400
uh that so it needs to be i probably

1234
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,480
discussed a little bit but i don't know

1235
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,319
that any of them are extremely critical

1236
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,839
either so

1237
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,520
um if anybody has anything else that

1238
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,119
there that they disagree with i'm happy

1239
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
to i'm here you can

1240
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,319
smack me around the side of the head and

1241
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,800
that's fine

1242
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,079
but that's the only one that i really

1243
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,440
know about so

1244
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,760
okay

1245
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,880
there were several proposals

1246
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,200
to adjust

1247
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,599
the syntax of the

1248
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,920
aggregate reports

1249
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,280
so that they can be automatically

1250
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,640
verified

1251
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,599
with the existing tools of

1252
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,680
xml

1253
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,599
centers

1254
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,960
and

1255
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,640
i hope sometime we will do that work in

1256
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,440
the

1257
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,480
working group

1258
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
okay alex i know what he's talking about

1259
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,000
um i haven't gone back and done that i

1260
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,920
don't know how much interest there is in

1261
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,599
having that done he there's

1262
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,839
the request is to have it so that it is

1263
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,440
i think that the document basically auto

1264
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,480
verifies itself is that correct

1265
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
i might already be there but if not not

1266
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,280
off mike please so

1267
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,400
uh john was asking about an rnc

1268
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,280
rng i think the one's compact one's not

1269
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,480
um

1270
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,920
so those i but i don't think that's what

1271
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,520
ale is asking about i think he's there

1272
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,880
was something else and there was a there

1273
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,240
was a google document out there

1274
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,240
somewhere that was created

1275
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,480
by i think matt and i don't matthias and

1276
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,920
i don't i have to go find it again if

1277
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,280
you or if you want to send to me i will

1278
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,480
take another look at it it might be even

1279
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
being a ticket

1280
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,200
is that correct

1281
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,360
[Music]

1282
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,040
it was in a google doc correct

1283
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,400
and then it never worked in with

1284
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,920
anything else

1285
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,559
yes no there were also some males

1286
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,599
by

1287
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,200
mark i i remember well

1288
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,359
okay

1289
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,760
thank you

1290
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,119
all right thank you

1291
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,640
all right and ale do you have anything

1292
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,240
you want to talk about with failure

1293
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,640
reporting

1294
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,040
i i

1295
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
i think

1296
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,119
it's it's quite a right it's not much

1297
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,040
perhaps i would propose to

1298
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,800
to only put the headers of uh

1299
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,960
of the original message in the mail

1300
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
because currently you can do both

1301
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,680
and

1302
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,880
actually

1303
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,480
nobody does it as far as i saw

1304
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,400
but

1305
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,960
there are privacy issues

1306
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,040
and so it is

1307
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,359
seldom used

1308
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,520
is not

1309
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,440
it is useful for organizations that

1310
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
start with

1311
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
demarc

1312
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,079
putting hard policies

1313
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,119
but

1314
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,599
very few people

1315
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,800
jesus

1316
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,760
failed reports

1317
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,400
still better than

1318
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,200
the

1319
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,799
spf failure of the chemotherapists

1320
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,680
that nobody does

1321
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,839
but

1322
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,799
it looks alright like it is

1323
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,520
todd and i were talking earlier this

1324
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,720
week about maybe like a header

1325
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,280
header-only version of reports or so

1326
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,440
that you don't include the content

1327
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,040
even more so you could potentially just

1328
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,440
include perhaps the message id

1329
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,800
um so that they're you know because

1330
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
there's still pii inside of the message

1331
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,000
headers there's still the email address

1332
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,880
or there could be something in the

1333
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,960
subject those sorts of things

1334
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,240
um so if you were to include just the

1335
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,839
message d which i realized could be

1336
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,359
duplicated that there's no requirement

1337
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,440
that it'd be unique um but at least it

1338
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,480
would give you something to potentially

1339
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,160
go on to go back to the source ip and

1340
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,800
say hey do you know what these were

1341
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,480
i don't that's sufficient in all cases

1342
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,200
but hopefully it helps but

1343
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,440
yeah it's up pete do you remember

1344
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,319
offhand what um

1345
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,880
message id uh what guarantees there are

1346
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,800
on message id being unique

1347
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,559
pete chuckles and while he's coming up

1348
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,160
to the mic seth what do you have to say

1349
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,559
two things one there was an original

1350
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,400
ticket for stripped down failure reports

1351
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,640
which is basically limiting it to header

1352
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,880
information and um

1353
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,480
it might be worthwhile to dust that off

1354
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,599
but two i think there's an rfc 6973

1355
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,079
impact due to privacy on failure reports

1356
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,839
that we need to discuss

1357
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,240
uh and so i will that's clearly we're

1358
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,599
not going to have that discussion in 10

1359
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,200
minutes it's probably a list discussion

1360
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,040
but i feel like we i feel like that's a

1361
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,680
critical one and frankly the operational

1362
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,960
impact of

1363
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,000
almost no one or no no major mailbox

1364
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,160
sends failure reports um some open

1365
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,599
source software does

1366
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,599
um and i believe

1367
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,839
10 cent out of china sends them but but

1368
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,000
no other there's no other source of them

1369
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,240
in the wild and so from an operational

1370
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,800
perspective and a 6973 perspective i

1371
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,280
think there's a a real conversation to

1372
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,480
be had

1373
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,960
okay well we'll take that to the mailing

1374
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,440
list pete so this is pete resnick the

1375
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,960
short answer is 53 22 says must be

1376
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,040
globally unique

1377
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,400
and and here's something that's what i

1378
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,160
thought here's some ways you might try

1379
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,680
and make that happen

1380
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,319
but guarantee it does not nothing is

1381
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,720
guaranteed right because it says you

1382
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,800
might want to use you know

1383
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,200
append a dome you know use a domain name

1384
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,559
on the right hand side that you have

1385
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,480
control over so you can make sure what's

1386
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,119
on the left-hand side is globally unique

1387
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,440
or just use a guide

1388
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,520
but even a guid is not going to be

1389
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,359
guaranteed to be globally as i say

1390
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,480
nothing is guaranteed so yeah but the

1391
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,559
point is that it is intended it is

1392
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,359
intended to be best effort unique

1393
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,160
yeah

1394
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,720
so i i think we can generally rely on

1395
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,720
them being unique for the purposes

1396
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,040
oh yeah yeah

1397
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,800
alex says his point is the spammers

1398
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,240
don't care they'll reuse whatever they

1399
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,720
feel like and absolutely of course so

1400
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,400
all right

1401
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,480
anyone else is there anything else we

1402
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,839
need to talk about related to dmarc

1403
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,119
victor don't bother putting yourself in

1404
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,319
the queue uh thanks uh just one quick uh

1405
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,000
note about

1406
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,319
tree walking and i dna

1407
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,119
if i remember correctly idna introduces

1408
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,400
at least two maybe three additional uh

1409
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,280
label separating period characters

1410
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,079
uh

1411
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,520
so that when you're parsing a domain

1412
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,760
name they can be separated by period or

1413
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,160
idiographic full stops or a couple of

1414
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,839
other weird

1415
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,720
puny code it should stick with the

1416
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,960
everything unicode is inside the label

1417
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,480
yeah but these are between the labels

1418
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
we're going to you'll be converting to a

1419
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,520
labels no not not those

1420
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,960
did they but

1421
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,839
let me just no you can stay up at the

1422
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,920
mic i'm just repeating john's answer is

1423
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,960
that uh

1424
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,480
he thinks that what victor was just

1425
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,520
talking about is in 2003 i dna not 2008

1426
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,839
this is a hopeless pit this

1427
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,119
the

1428
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,119
idn punctuation is a pit of hopeless

1429
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,319
despair

1430
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,920
that i don't think we should i don't i

1431
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,000
don't think we should get into i think

1432
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,440
anybody who

1433
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,200
anybody who knows how to turn

1434
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,119
you labels into a labels

1435
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,400
will have will have their own opinions

1436
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,760
about what dots to look for and i don't

1437
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,800
think we need to talk about it

1438
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,480
and

1439
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,559
as someone else who knows about idna i

1440
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,680
agree with john so

1441
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,760
and victor is perusing

1442
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,640
rfcs right now so he might jump back up

1443
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,400
um while he's doing that is there

1444
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,400
anything else anyone would like to say

1445
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,559
hearing nothing we have six minutes left

1446
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,319
let's give another victory do you need

1447
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,520
another minute to look at stuff

1448
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,839
okay uh any anything further will be

1449
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,040
taken to the list on that point

1450
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,480
so seeing nothing else

1451
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,280
i think we have uh now five minutes back

1452
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,400
to our afternoon

1453
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,480
thank you everybody for coming and

1454
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,640
especially thanks to the people who came

1455
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,040
uh remotely and uh

1456
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,440
uh if you're in europe uh

1457
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,000
thanks for coming late in the evening

1458
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,520
thank you everyone thank you again for

1459

the to the editors for uh pulling

1460
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,000
everything together and making such

1461
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,319
rapid changes

1462
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,040
okay

1463
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,920
so this is the thing

1464
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,720
separated
