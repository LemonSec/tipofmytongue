7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,720

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,679

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
sarah may uh join us

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
in progress i hope that she does

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
and now she usually

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,559
uh joins in any case so uh

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,600
we'll uh

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,360
welcome her when she does

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
but i'm al morton

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
i'm one of the co-chairs of benchmarking

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,200
methodology

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,480
working group

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
i've currently got a

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,480
paralyzed vocal cord

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,719
which makes me sound a little different

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
than usual

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
but

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
there's no uh there's no problem with my

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
uh

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
uh trying to speak

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
at this point it uh

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,640
it

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
just sounds funny

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
and it takes a little more effort than

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
usual

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
so anyway we'll uh

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
we'll take it ahead here

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
low from the meeting room

um

176
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,400
okay

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
so warren's looking at the agenda

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
i think uh

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,760

181
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,039
[Music]

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,520
okay yep my thing's really short

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
basically it's hi everyone i'm currently

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
up sadie

185
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
i've been doing this for a while now my

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
role is up at

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
um

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
beginning of march end of march

189
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,840
something like that

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
i'm still enjoying it so i will probably

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,919
run again but i would also be really

192
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
happy if there are some other candidates

193
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
you know so the community can actually

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
make a choice this time

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
so if anybody's interested in finding

196
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
out more about the role or might be

197
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
willing to serve

198
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
it is actually a lot of fun

199
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
please let me know come and chat with me

200

at some time during the meeting and i'm

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
happy to explain what the role is

202
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
actually like what the time investment

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
is etc

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440

that's great thanks

208
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
um

209
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
warren uh you know one

210
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,440
one thing that uh has sort of come up

211
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
which um

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
um

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
you know it's been kind of a question

214
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
for some of our newer participants

215
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
and uh basically all of our i think all

216
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,000
of our current participants who have

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
drafts uh in the working group or

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
nearing completion

219
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
um

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
may not be familiar with your role

221
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
when the draft comes up for the final

222
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
review in front of the iesg

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,639
uh would you like to say a few words

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,120
about that

225
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
sure so i mean

226
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
one of the main things that takes time

227
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
is the area director supposed to review

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
all documents coming out of the

229
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
working groups in their area

230
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
and pay specific attention so is the

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
document complete

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
check the shepard write-up etc

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,160
and then actually progress it through

234
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
the iesg

235
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
um there's the isg eval where all the

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
ads that have reviewed the document and

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,039
comment

238
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,319
um

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,879
another large portion of it is actually

240
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,680
the isg reviews all documents which get

241
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
progressed so basically any document

242
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,399
which moves from a

243
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
internet draft to becoming an rfc

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
ads sort of have to review them all

245
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
paying particular attention to conflicts

246
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,320
in their area and also sort of general

247
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,679
quality

248
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
has processed being followed et cetera

249
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
and then there's also sort of four ops

250
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
for the ops area managing around seven

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,839
working groups bmwg

252
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
dnsof siderocks etc

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
so the role requires a fair bit of

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
review

255
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
but also

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
um

257
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
quite a lot of

258
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,480
breadth of knowledge um you know dns a

259
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
little bit of benchmarking routing etc

260
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
um did that actually cover what you

261
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,519
asked the audio is not great so i missed

262
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
some of the question

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
oh yeah sorry um

264
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
uh basically uh

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
you know when when comments come in from

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
the other

267
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
area directors

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,880
you uh you take a role in uh helping us

269
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
getting those resolved

270
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
and um

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
i wanna wondered if you want to say a

272
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,839
word about

273
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,800
that um

274
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
yes i do i must admit for bmwg i have

275
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,160
not been taking nearly as active a role

276
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
as brian might be able to attest to

277
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
um

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
but i mean yeah a reasonable amount of

279
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
it is also sort of after after iesg eval

280
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
if there are any discusses on the

281
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
document

282
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,240
part of it is sort of helping

283
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
helping guide the document through the

284
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
last part although there is also the

285
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,079
responsibility of the document shepard

286
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,440
um

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,399
but yeah so having having knowledge in

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
benchmarking and dns and cider ops and

289
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,720
iot

290
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
would be very helpful is that what you

291
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
were asking

292
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
yeah and like

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
i really wanted to thank you for um all

294
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
your time as a

295
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
scenario director working with bmwg

296
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
um i really uh i really appreciated that

297
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
when you first took the

298
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
uh syria director role on as and as our

299
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
our advisor

300
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,680
you started to dabble in some

301
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
benchmarking to get your feet wet in it

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
and um that was uh i thought really

303
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
useful so uh

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,839
you know thanks for the time you've

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,320
spent so far and now

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
obviously uh you know we'd really like

307
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
to have you back but um

308
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
you know that's yet to be decided so uh

309
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
in any case uh um

310
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
keep reviewing and keep calm

311
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
thanks right so on to the rest of the

312
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,719
working group status

313
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
so um

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,640
next generation firewall benchmarking is

315
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,360
uh

316
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
um

317
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
been

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
been in the nih

319
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,560
review uh since february

320
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
still trying to resolve uh poor disgust

321
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
ballots plus the comments

322
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,279
uh we got a

323
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,000
request for transport area review again

324
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,240
and the good news is a lot of that's

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
coming together in the context of this

326
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
meeting and in the email exchanges uh in

327
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,760
between uh the march and the

328
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,320
february meeting so um you know i think

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
that uh uh brian's gonna say some more

330
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
about that but

331
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,519
it looks like we're pointed in the right

332
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,760
direction there

333
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
we can expect a large rewrite for the

334
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
multiple loss ratio search from maciac

335
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
and brodco

336
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
we did finally get the yang model uh for

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
benchmarking

338
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
adopted

339
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
uh we're going to try to close out on

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
working group adoption

341
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
for the statefulnet xy gateways today

342
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
and proposals keep coming so that means

343
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
uh keep reviewing uh if you've got

344
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
proposals uh learned by

345
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,639
by reviewing the stuff that we've

346
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
already got going

347
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
and that the uh

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,160
um you know a good background for you to

349
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
uh you know

350
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
what we're doing and and what we expect

351
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
in uh

352
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
the proposals that are successful here

353
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
so uh just general advice to all of our

354
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
folks

355
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
um no rfcs in the last period our

356
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
charter has been very stable and we've

357
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
got this supplementary page that people

358
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
can go check out

359
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
um thanks to sarah and company

360
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
for providing it

361
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
so i've gone in and looked at the

362
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
milestones and updated them

363
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
and uh

364
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
so we've got these uh new ones i really

365
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
shouldn't have made them in red but uh

366
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
um i've

367
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,360
updated the dates here for a few of them

368
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,560
and um

369
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
there's one that's more done which uh

370
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
you know it's basically done since the

371
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
last meeting we still need to to do the

372
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,800
you know the

373
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
publication part of it but uh this first

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
one here is at least

375
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
made it to iesg review and that's a good

376
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
thing

377
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
the other ones on our list are done

378
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,959
and these others have been revised

379
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,079
so uh we'll probably be adding

380
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,560
the yang model i see is uh satisfying

381
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
this one uh the draft on selecting

382
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
uh and applying models for benchmarking

383
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
uh and then the other ones will we'll

384
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,920
need to take a look at whether we have

385
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,279
something ready to go or not

386
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
so anyway

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,279
that's where we stand on milestones

388
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,959
and in the back up

389
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
i just include this

390
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
standard paragraph that helps us get

391
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
through security reviews

392
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,120
and

393
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
i think that's pretty much it

394
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
so any questions on the working group

395
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,199
status

396
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
okay

397
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,079
all right

398
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
so seeing none

399
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,639
we'll move on to the um

400
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,760
working group drafts

401
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
and for that

402
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
um let's see here

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
so we've got a couple of topics today

404
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
where we don't have slides

405
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
and what that means is

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,959
um

407
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,319
i'm gonna share my screen

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
somehow

409
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
here it goes

410
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
oh okay i gotta ditch this

411
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,600
and then i can do this

412
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
yes

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
oh really okay

414
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
let's try it

415
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,240
again yes

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,079
screen one

417
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,720
so um

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
can everybody yeah i guess you can see

419
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
the

420
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
wow okay

421
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
so everybody can see the um the muteco

422
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
notes

423
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
and the uh the draft on uh multiple loss

424
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
ratio search

425
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
uh we had a we had a detailed update

426
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,079
from uh veraco one of the co-authors

427
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
and i've got the uh

428
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,880
the link pointing to that on the mail

429
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
list

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,480
basically they've um continue just a

431
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
larger rewrite

432
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
of the uh

433
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
the draft

434
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
lots of earlier materials been commented

435
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,759
out

436
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,160
and um one of the questions they've been

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
um

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,079
asking

439
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,480
which i highlighted in my response on

440
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
the list was

441
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
the ability of

442
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
the authors who are trying to do

443
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
basically trying to do more work than

444
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,680
um

445
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
you know the typical benchmarking here

446
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,720
uh you know they're the typical

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
throughput rfc 2544 throughput

448
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,519
is a um

449
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,480
that's basically a zero loss

450
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,120
uh level of throughput so they're trying

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
to measure throughput at multiple levels

452
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
of loss that's why the name for the

453
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
draft is

454
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,199
multiple loss ratio search and

455
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,560
you know when they're doing that they're

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
encountering sort of some interesting

457
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
problems with

458
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,000
sort of partial support from the current

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
definitions

460
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,880
and

461
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
complete support from the current

462
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
definitions and so forth

463
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
and i you know i kind of think that um

464
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
you know at least at least when they um

465
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,399
when they measure

466
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,279
uh the zero loss ratio which is usually

467
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,040
part of the set you know that should be

468
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,400
a full loss case and with full support

469
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,760
and then um

470
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,599
kind of like what they do beyond that is

471
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,439
um

472
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,000
sort of the best they can do i guess uh

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but if anyone else has

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,720
read the draft anyone else has

475
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,839
looked at the

476
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,640
email and considered the questions

477
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,280
uh now will be a good time to uh

478
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,918
to add some comments

479
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
all right

480
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
so if anybody

481
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
has read the drafts

482
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
please let us know somehow

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
okay

484
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
so um

485
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,559
well then uh you know i encourage

486
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,120
the folks in the room to um

487
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,799
uh sort of reach out

488
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
um help the authors a little bit

489
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
uh you'll probably see uh

490
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
i see the co-chairs do that and they can

491
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
make some time

492
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
and um you know it's it's up for us as a

493
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
work group to work together and move all

494
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
the drafts forward

495
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,120
uh the main thing in that is that helps

496
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
us

497
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
open up some slots for new work

498
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
so if you're trying to get something

499
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,919
accomplished here

500
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,400
help the other folks out and

501
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
i'm sure it'll be reciprocated that's

502
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
the way it's always worked here so um in

503
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
any case thanks for that

504
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
and thanks for your future uh

505
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
uh collaboration

506
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
all right

507
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,240
so um

508
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799
the next topic is uh

509
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,200
which we also don't have any slides for

510
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
is uh benchmarking and by the way i

511
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
don't really i'm not really criticizing

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
on this it's just it's perfectly fine

513
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
that we have uh discussions on these

514
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
topics and um

515
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
you know the information on the security

516
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
device performance has been coming in

um so the uh

530
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
we plan to uh post a new draft within

531
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
the next um two or three weeks but

532
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
there's been a lot of work that's been

533
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
going on behind the scenes

534
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,440
since uh the last ietf

535
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
um as you mentioned earlier uh we've

536
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
been working with tommy pauley

537
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,320
who is helping us

538
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,600
sort of

539
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
expand the draft to cover off uh quick

540
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
and http 3 in a lot more detail

541
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,880
and

542
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
i think we're making some good headway

543
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
in that area

544
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
uh you mentioned the four discussed

545
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
comments uh we've we've addressed all of

546
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
that with with the exception of the

547
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
comments that lars put out and we're uh

548
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,120
we're dealing with tommy to help address

549
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
those there was also

550
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
some comments that were made uh

551
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,280
previously about all of the shoulds that

552
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
we had in there and

553
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
we've identified

554
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
a significant number of the shows that

555
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
we're going to change to musts or that

556
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
will expand

557
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
expand the text on it to explain why

558
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,919
it's

559
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,520
why it should

560
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,559
that will not be in the um

561
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
in the upcoming uh draft because we

562
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
wanted to

563
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
get all of the the major points um out

564
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
the door and get the area directors

565
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
taking a look at it but once we get um

566
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
approval

567
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
of the changes that we made with the uh

568
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
with all of the discuss points then we

569
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,840
will do the shoulds and it'll should be

570
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,760
at that point no pun intended um yeah it

571
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,640
uh

572
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,360
would

573
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
it will be ready for uh to move forward

574
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,039
in my opinion and um shout out to warren

575
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,799
thank you very much for getting the area

576
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,679

577
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,799
well

578
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,000

um

583
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,880
let me see uh i'm trying

584
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
i'm trying to think if i have any

585
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
specific questions

586
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,159
um

587
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,400
do you have um

588
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,799
um

589
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,880
you have uh do you have enough material

590
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,000
you need

591
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
to uh

592
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
put in some default values

593
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,039
for the

594
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
um

595
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,799
like for example the window sizes and

596
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
things for the other protocols

597
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
that uh

598
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,640
are mentioned in the draft but uh as you

599
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
as you mentioned to me

600
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
the test equipment currently doesn't

601
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
implement quick for example

602
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
i mean that quick came in as a as a

603
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,320
response to a comment

604
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
so um you know we're open open looking

605
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
for help in that regard

606
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
well the test test equipment does um

607
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
implement quick but they may not

608
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,559
implement it as per the um

609
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,360
the standard um since the standard was

610
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
only about a i think was only ratified

611
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,919
about a month or month or so back

612
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,880
um

613
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
but

614
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,440
we are definitely uh looking at various

615
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
uh references to

616
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,799
to address things along the lines of

617
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
what you suggested

618
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,880
and um you know some decent reference

619
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
sites that uh

620
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,559
you know we've got links to

621
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,879
okay

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
of course to provide the level of detail

623
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
i think that will support that'll

624
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,280
satisfy the folks in the transport area

625
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
yeah yeah

626
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
did tommy know if anything any of these

627
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,559
off the top of his head

628
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,080
um

629
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,039
no i don't believe he believe he did but

630
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
um i did i did take it as an action that

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
i would uh forward him those those um

632
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
sites so he would have an opportunity to

633
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
take a look at it and i'm also thinking

634
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,240
about how we can reference those sites

635
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,360
uh within the draft which is a question

636
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,200
that i wanna i'm gonna talk to you about

637
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
good

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
okay

639
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
all right that was the that was the

640
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,159
stuff in my mind

641
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,039
um

642
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
any other questions for brian

643
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880

i haven't been more active on this i

645

kind of

646
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,679
some of the thread fell off the bottom

647
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,600
of my mailbox and i'd assumed that

648
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
things were happening obviously feel

649
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
free to poke me hard if yep if you need

650
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360

651
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,120

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
uh good news on the yang data model

657
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
uh we finally adopted that as a work

658
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,840
group draft

659
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
um i think that uh

660
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
uh vladimir is in the

661
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
virtual room with us

662
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
and um at least

663
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
or um

664
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
maybe in the room in uh

665
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,640
in

666
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
in real life

667
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
but maybe you'd like to see if say a few

668
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
words about this uh

669
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,400
vladimir

670
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,959
hi yeah we can hear you vlad

671
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,320
are you able to hear me

672
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,860
yeah

673
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,200
[Music]

674
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,960
hey i

675
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
appreciate the quick response of

676
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
vladimir to the comments that i left on

677
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,000
the list

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
um and i didn't mean to imply that we

679
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,880
had to have a yang doctors review so

680
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
early but it's really good to do because

681
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,919
um the way it's written

682
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,760
you set it up at the top of the document

683
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
and then immediately get into the yang

684
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,679
and so just getting extra eyeballs on

685
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,799
that earlier is always a good idea

686
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,440
but i appreciated uh the the the easy

687
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
read of that uh and the quick response

688
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
to the the comments

689
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
if any of you are interested in the room

690
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
and haven't taken a look at this draft

691
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
it's a really approachable draft if it's

692
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
your first time to bmwg

693
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
and you having a yang experience it's a

694
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,000
really great draft to take a look at

695
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,559
um as i mentioned

696
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
as you bring drafts into the group part

697
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
of how you get other reviews is by doing

698
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,600
the same for other folks so

699
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
this is a really good one to start with

700
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
if you haven't read it yet or if you

701
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
have any interested in at all in the

702
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,640
yang model he's laid out there

703
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
great thank you sarah

704
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,640
and i'm glad i accidentally

705
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
evoked your audio because i couldn't

706
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
hear anything

707
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,200
so if you uh if you want to request

708
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
um audio again i thought we heard you

709
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,559
just for a second

710
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
oh can you hear me now

711
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
yes yes we can

712
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,080
okay good

713
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,240
uh yes i agree with sarah and

714
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
it's very important if we can find

715
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
members that are interested in the draft

716
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
and

717
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
especially young doctor review will help

718
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
we'll get at least one more

719
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
young specialist

720
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,320
to have his eyes on that

721
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
and we're looking to some use cases like

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,840
this

723
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,399
implementation that i have for running

724
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,360
codes that we can

725
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,799
use with some

726
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,880
third parties and

727
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
members of the itf which are interested

728
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,960
in trying it out

729
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,039
seeing how it uh

730
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
like

731
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,000
its usability and

732
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
if they have their own use cases for the

733
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,399
draft which we can

734
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,600
support

735
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
eventually add to the discussion this

736
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,200
would also help the document so

737
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
anyone who can help in a way of finding

738
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
people that

739
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
can be critical for the text and the

740
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,559
draft and have applications that can

741
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,720
benefit to find such a

742
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
draft

743
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,399
we should try to to kind of get their

744
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,720
attention to to the working group and

745
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
and start from there

746
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
great

747
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,120
by the way uh uh vladimir how did the um

748
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,639
how did the hackathon go

749
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,279
well i am going to

750
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,760
publish a presentation which always

751
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
comes later than

752
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,840
the deadline for presentations so i'm

753
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
going to send the link to the

754
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
mailing list

755
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,960
and it's like

756
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
mostly

757
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
trying to add the the

758
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,039
multi-stream implementation working and

759
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
trying it out

760
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,120
and the funny thing is one needs the the

761
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
multi-stream

762
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,960
implementation for the last two test

763
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,640
test

764
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,200
points in the rfc

765
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,039
which is the reset test and uh recovery

766
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,000
test

767
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
there you have to have two different

768
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
streams that

769
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,919
at some point change the the type of

770
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,120
pockets that are being sent

771
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,200
and that's what i was working for but

772
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,840
the details will be sent

773
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,639
on the mailing list

774
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,840
great

775
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
yes i

776
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
i really have nothing more to add if

777
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
there are any questions

778
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
if someone who is interested in the

779
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,799
draft

780
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
you don't see that

781
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,279
okay

782
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,200
well thanks for your thanks for your

783
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
work on this and your your flexibility

784
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
on the titling of the draft especially

785
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
uh vladimir appreciated

786
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
so anyway congratulations on working

787
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,640
group adoption

788
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,600
and we want to see this through now

789
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,080
so let's get some reviewers of it does

790
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
anybody volunteer to review the draft

791
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,240
today

792
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,120
i don't see any hands but

793
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
also that

794
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
the camera on the on the audience is a

795
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
pretty tight angle

796
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,039
so

797
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,360
in any case uh thanks for your work

798
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,000
vladimir

799
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,480
all right

800
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,120
so the next topic is um

801
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
is really closing out a working group

802
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
adoption review

803
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,679
and um there's kind of a long history

804
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
here for the benchmarking methodology

805
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,600
for stateful uh net xy gateways

806
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,240
um so long before the

807
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,799
adoption uh we had um

808
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,159
lots of people uh supporting and um

809
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,559
commenting on the draft all through this

810
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,760
sort of same period uh last year

811
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,039
and

812
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,039
uh there's been lots of improvements to

813
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,240
the draft also a couple of a couple

814
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,640
couple or three people effort replied to

815
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,279
the most recent call for adoption

816
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,399
and um

817
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,120
so let's turn it over to um

818
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,000
uh

819
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,720
gabor who's going to be uh

820
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
speaking today on the on the draft gabor

821
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,039
i'm gonna

822
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,200
i'm gonna show the slides from here

823
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
after figure out uh the right ways to do

824
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,080
this

825
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
i hope that you can hear me well

826
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
can you hear me here

827
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
yes yeah we can hear you're just fine

828
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,000
okay so uh i'm waiting to see my slides

829
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
if you can share yeah i know

830
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
i know i'm getting there don't worry

831
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
so okay

832
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,640
right now thank you

833
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,120
so much i mentioned the title of our

834
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,279
draft is a bit lengthy but i think

835
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,039
everywhere is important

836
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,039
because

837
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,039
we would like to provide the methodology

838
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,760
for benchmarking the space for energy

839
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
expired in place xy means

840
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,159
x and y both maybe

841
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,440
4 and 6. so nad44 and k64 and even nh366

842
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
could be the gateway and it is important

843
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,840
that we are using uh rc 4814 saturn on

844
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,600
both numbers not fixed score numbers

845
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,960
like

846
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,640
both numbers could you go to the next

847
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
slide

848
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
so

849
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
the aim of the composer is to provide

850
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,960
a methodology how we can benchmark

851
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
statefulnet xy gateways to to measure

852
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,559
their standard performance metrics

853
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,919
defined by rfc 2544

854
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,679
rfc

855
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,880
or rfc 8219 like throughput the

856
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,799
intensity famously

857
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,720
delay variation in the tech delegation

858
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,000
and so on

859
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
and and of course the title is that this

860
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,120
is a stateful and i think

861
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,279
xy gateway is not not just routers or

862
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,559
reviews

863
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,039
and of course because they're stateful

864
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,760
uh they don't not only have to solve how

865
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
to measure these metrics but there are

866
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
some

867
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,120
metrics which are specific to

868
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,039
for testing for example they define

869
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,399
maximum connection instead which

870
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,320
moderate measurement and connection t

871
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,519
direct measurement was the last time and

872
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,600
now the new thing is the connection

873
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,440
taking capacity

874
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,840
of capacity

875
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,399
measurements in this today's slides and

876
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,279
of course we have to use these so there

877
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,799
are no both numbers

878
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,918
let me go to the next slide

879
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,760
it will be about the history yes it is

880
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,320
about the history so it was presented to

881
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
us in idf 111 with the three world clan

882
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
division methodology and the next time

883
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,760
they defined the measurement of the

884
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,679
connection building table to make clear

885
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,800
measurements

886
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
and last time was the connection clear

887
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
downward measurement method and now

888
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,719
comes two methods

889
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,239
uh the validation of conduction

890
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,320
establishment and

891
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
the next method which uses this one

892
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,239
heavily is the connection tracking table

893
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
capacity measurement method and

894
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
with this

895
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
i hope that that the most important

896
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,560
things will be completed so we go to the

897
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
next slide

898
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,719
so this slides uh there's a few slides

899
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,879
which are reminders of course reminder

900
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
for those who have already heard about

901
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,639
it and if

902
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,918
you haven't been

903
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,560
present in the past idf meetings then

904
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,960
it may be a new thing so let me let me

905
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
just summarize uh the parts which have

906
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
already been presented before

907
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,880
so test setup is very simple

908
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
for all of you because we have one

909
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
desktop and one device under test

910
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,960
but uh unlike this

911
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,760
router testing now we have on the one

912
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,000
side the left side private rb version

913
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
for addresses and public icon version 42

914
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,520
on the right side and the two ports of

915
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
the tester called initiator and

916
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,400
responder this is this is their role so

917
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,800
initiator may initiate a new connection

918
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
through the facebook device under test

919
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
which is let's say an mp4 for gateway

920
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
now because i use uh happy version for

921
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,040
addresses for simplicity but it goes the

922
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
same for six for another

923
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,960
solutions so the initiator

924
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,160
just uses some port ranges and sends

925
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
frames through the stateful device from

926
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,040
the test device and

927
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
when they are transmitted back to the

928
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
responder the responder

929
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
stores the four titles i mean source

930
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
active address the destination appear

931
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
their source port number extension port

932
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,920
number uh to their save table

933
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
and using these four titles of course

934
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
changes throughout the destination uh it

935
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
may send a traffic back to the states

936
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
with nat

937
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,520
xy gateway because otherwise it couldn't

938
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,359
be done because

939
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,240
it would just drop the

940
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,920
test stream which do not belong to any

941
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
existing connection

942
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,000
and of course uh when a connection is

943
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,920
initiated it is stored in a connection

944
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
plane table with one from the test and

945
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
which connections exist in there

946
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,880
that the walls can be used the regular

947
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,480
action let me go for the next slide

948
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,560
yes

949
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,160
and the measurement is done in two

950
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
phases so um the new thing is the

951
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,200
primary test space which serves two

952
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,920
purposes of course we have to fill the

953
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,640
device under tests for uh connection

954
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
driven table and also they have to fill

955
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
in the state table of the responder

956
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,520
which had four toppers uh because from

957
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,160
the very first segment of the of the

958
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,720
test it has to be eager to send

959
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,359
claims on in the reverse direction i

960
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,920
mean from the responder to the initiator

961
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
also because we would like to use

962
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,320
redirectional traffic

963
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
and of course

964
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,119
this primary phase which always precedes

965
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,280
the real test phase but in its past

966
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,640
terminator phase

967
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,119
can be used for uh

968
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,480
measuring maximum potential

969
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,119
establishment rate and if you would like

970
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,839
to

971
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,599
perform a traditional test like

972
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,079
throughput train of late uh latency

973
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,680
pocket deliveration or injectable

974
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,560
variation uh it is done in the real test

975
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,520
phase which has been considered by the

976
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,280
prime minister states

977
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
and they can be

978
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,480
done as usual

979
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,599
will you go to the next slide

980
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,920
and therefore we would like to achieve a

981
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,920
repeatable and meaningful results so we

982
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
need to we would like to achieve two

983
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
excellent situations one of the

984
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
situation is when

985
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,920
every time spending is a new connection

986
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,520
it is ideal for measuring the natural

987
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,440
international establishment rate because

988
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
it is only that it is also necessary uh

989
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
for the other

990
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
measurements in the community phase that

991
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,440
we have to fill in the device under

992
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
tests connection tracking table and the

993
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
testers state table

994
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,560
so it is

995
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,240
let us say that and

996
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,160
in the second phase in the real-time

997
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,040
phase

998
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,800
the frame should not

999
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,200
create any new connection so for this

1000
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
reason

1001
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,280
we can

1002
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,960
and of course

1003
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
be able to achieve these

1004
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
clear conditions

1005
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
that means we have to use the following

1006
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
three things

1007
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,440
below

1008
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
we need to have a large enough and empty

1009
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
connection telling table before each

1010
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,920
test and we use the random enumeration

1011
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,160
of all possible port opportunities the

1012
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
primary phase and we use the properly

1013
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,079
high climate value in the device of the

1014
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,920
test which means that the final value

1015
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,839
must be larger than the

1016
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,839
length of the primary phase and the

1017
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,280
delay between the two phases and the

1018
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,000
length of the reactor space then

1019
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
the connection is not not typo

1020
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,119
so could you go to the next slide

1021
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
so it was

1022
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,359
really the reminder so far and now comes

1023
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,640
the new thing

1024
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,280
we also repeat the measurement methods

1025
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
for the maximum connection transmission

1026
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,400
rate because we would like to refine it

1027
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
of course it's very simple in the

1028
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
primary phase the

1029
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,280
in the initiator sense n number of

1030
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,839
we give our photos that are raised to

1031
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,359
the respondents through the device under

1032
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,320
test

1033
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,040
and the responder just counts the very

1034
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
few things and

1035
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,160
of course we use we don't use a multiple

1036
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,800
of

1037
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,880
patreon switch but we use a level of

1038
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,560
testing so if all frames arrived then we

1039
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
say the fact that this was successful

1040
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,200
and we choose the upper half interval

1041
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,599
from the binary search if

1042
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,960
if anyone if even

1043
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,839
trains

1044
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,520
the problem is that we cannot prove that

1045
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,079
even if a test frame has gone through

1046
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,440
the divine standard attack from the

1047
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,079
initiator to the responder then it is

1048
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,440
surely a

1049
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,200
in an establishment of a new connection

1050
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,319
because we may not examine directly the

1051
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,160
connection testing table because we do

1052
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,960
black box testing so the solution is

1053
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,640
that if we do a functional validation in

1054
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
the later space it means that the

1055
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,160
responder uses all m4 tappers stored in

1056
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,680
the state table and at the lower rate

1057
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,400
it sends frames back to the initiator

1058
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
and of course if

1059
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,599
the corresponding connection is not

1060
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,119
there then the frame will not arrive

1061
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,240
back we need to use a reduce rate

1062
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
so that it may happen that the frame is

1063
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,880
lost just because the connection is not

1064
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
there not because we are using a too

1065
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
high rate so this is why we use this

1066
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,560
vector one sub which is usually less

1067
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,319
than one but in some cases it can be

1068
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,920
also bound

1069
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
and of course

1070
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,200
that's just a binary search for the

1071
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,839
initiator comes the received frames and

1072
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,880
uh the binary search is done and we

1073
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,720
do the test can you go to the next slide

1074
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
there's some smash here

1075
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,000
yes

1076
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,240
so

1077
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,440
on the right next column we can see the

1078
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,400
results with no validation so

1079
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
we have four million connections

1080
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,560
and

1081
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,480
we measured it

1082
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,319
at which

1083
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
at the high states at which connections

1084
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,960
can be established so

1085
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,520
the reference result

1086
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,800
black rectangle is uh

1087
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,000
478 000 connections per second with dual

1088
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,400
n86 for implementation

1089
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,119
and then there are some results with

1090
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,079
different values of foreign

1091
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,800
at the first two columns you can see

1092
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,040
some degradation such as regulation it

1093
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,280
means that the trouble was that the

1094
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,720
offer was too high but if you see 0.5

1095
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,920
and 0.25 for alpha in this case the

1096
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,599
inner difference of course you can see

1097
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,240
some light side differences because

1098
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
there are computers and some random

1099
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,839
events it may happen

1100
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,920
you can see the medium is between the

1101
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,160
minimum maximum values and there's a

1102
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,359
very little difference from the

1103
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,960
reference value but actually we're going

1104
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,119
to say that these values makes no

1105
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,560
difference

1106
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
so these are the correct values for

1107
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
validation and of course we can say that

1108
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
even if we measured this little

1109
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,119
variation it was

1110
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,560
the connections

1111
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
established but we couldn't prove it now

1112
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,520
we can prove it

1113
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,640
you go to the next slide

1114
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,000
and this procedure is very important uh

1115
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,599
because we will have a use this

1116
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,480
procedure uh for the connection planning

1117
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,640
table proxy measurement uh which

1118
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,599
comprises of two steps first it was xml

1119
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,760
search exponential search to find the

1120
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
order of magnitude of the size of the

1121
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,079
connection table and then we do find a

1122
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,319
final binary first to find this exact

1123
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,720
value so in some

1124
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,359
simple words it means that we start with

1125
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,440
a safe value

1126
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,599
let's say we know that

1127
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,319
for sure for another experiment that one

1128
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,319
million connections can be fully stored

1129
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,079
in the connection training table then

1130
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,040
this double size and we performed

1131
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,119
by validating connection solution

1132
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,920
measurement and we measure uh with the

1133
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,480
original per million size and the number

1134
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,720
with two million signs and if it

1135
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
seriously drops

1136
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,480
we have a suspect we suspect that

1137
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,560
there's a problem if it doesn't drop

1138
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
seriously just a little bit then we

1139
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,640
believe that

1140
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,240
two medium connections was successfully

1141
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,200
stored

1142
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
of course if it is validated we can know

1143
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
it for sure and it will store it

1144
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,160
and then

1145
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,440
again and once it will stop and then we

1146
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,839
have an order of magnitude estimation

1147
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,079
and then we do final bond research

1148
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,480
which says uh how many connections can

1149
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,000
be released to work

1150
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
so these are some some different factors

1151
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,240
like authorization

1152
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,119
measurement and there's some other

1153
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,760
values data is the

1154
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,079
reducing factor for the excellent cell

1155
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,160
search and gamma is the reducing factor

1156
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,560
for the final binary search did you go

1157
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
to the next slide

1158
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,160
and i don't want to read

1159
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
this algorithm to the theoretical

1160
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,720
algorithm of the excellent search church

1161
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,759
could you go to the next slide

1162
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
is

1163
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,079
because

1164
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,280
i have

1165
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,440
invented some better algorithm which is

1166
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,680
which has much better runtime

1167
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,879
so could you get your next slide please

1168
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,000
yes

1169
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,079
all the details can be found in section

1170
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,960
4.9 of the task and there's a central

1171
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,200
frontal script which can be found at

1172
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,640
github that is a bash script which i

1173
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,720
have used for measurements so you go to

1174
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,359
the next night

1175
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,359
so the

1176
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,760
first column you see the c0 value which

1177
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,839
is the safe value for the connection

1178
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,720
setting table size and with that value i

1179
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,319
measured the

1180
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,599
question establishment rate because r0

1181
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,640
and then

1182
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
i always doubled the sizes and the last

1183
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,800
safe value was cf was four million

1184
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,319
and ct was when the test failed it was

1185
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,599
eight million

1186
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,079
it was the result so cs and ct were the

1187
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,040
result of the inference church and then

1188
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,720
the final binary search found

1189
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,079
and you can see it's very exact so that

1190
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
it was evaluated by these different

1191
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,560
variations of the of the results and it

1192
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,800
fights quite good equipment with a

1193
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,200
vertical value because the hash size and

1194
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,599
the nf conduct max size which means the

1195
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,520
size of concentrating table was 2 to the

1196
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,560
power of 22 and we just found nearly the

1197
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
same value we didn't but if you narrow

1198
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,880
it

1199
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,440
up to the next slide

1200
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,119
this is my final slide

1201
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,920
and i might just have some questions

1202
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
that what do you think of the algorithm

1203
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,280
of the white house's connection

1204
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,480
establishment takes measurement

1205
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,079
algorithm and the connection taking

1206
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,720
table measurement algorithm and do you

1207
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,440
think that they do them reasonable or if

1208
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,200
you have some comments how to improve

1209
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,119
them i have to

1210
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,800
to see your comments

1211
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,280
and the question is that if you find

1212
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,599
this platform on a network

1213
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,920
i i don't i don't feel anything missing

1214
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,839
but maybe you can point out something

1215
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,160
missing and final question is of course

1216
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,359
that if you like it and you like it

1217
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,720
you don't have to adopt

1218
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,759
that we will be very happy

1219
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,960
okay

1220
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,880
great thanks to gabor

1221
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,599
and thank uh thank you when you uh talk

1222
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,839
to him

1223
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,760
you know you guys have both been working

1224
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,800
on this

1225
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,359
um then some others as well

1226
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,480
with their comments i noticed a uh i

1227
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,720
noticed a comment come through

1228
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
um in the chat

1229
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,280
um

1230
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,920
it is better to have an example picture

1231
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
that is based on ipv6

1232
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,520
not ipv4 this is the comment that comes

1233
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,559
from

1234
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,559
edward v

1235
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,680
and

1236
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,480
edward is one of the other uh as a

1237
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
co-author of one of the other drafts

1238
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,119
that we're gonna uh talk about today i

1239
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,000
think

1240
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,119
so um

1241
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,720
uh what do you think about that uh

1242
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,200
well to be honest i used ipv version

1243
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,040
four because i thought that the majority

1244
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,319
so originally this this

1245
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,839
thing was done for an an m80 a faithful

1246
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,640
n864 tester so for me it would be much

1247
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,960
more natural to use

1248
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,839
ip version 6

1249
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,280
drawing but i just wanted to help others

1250
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,440
because i used to version 4 but i can

1251
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,520
replace it i have i have the drawing and

1252
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,079
in some paper i use both but i will if

1253
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,839
you want i i will replace

1254
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,040
version 4 with version 6

1255
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,520
well um

1256
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,280
maybe maybe the best thing to do is have

1257
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,240
both

1258
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,359
and that way it satisfies everybody

1259
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,319
okay okay

1260
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,920
and uh

1261
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,599
one word of uh

1262
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,000
one word of input from me

1263
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,200
and that is uh be sure you use the um

1264
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,119
the address space

1265
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,920
that's allocated to uh

1266
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,599
bmwg

1267
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,040
uh but it exists both in the in the v4

1268
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,839
space and the v6 space

1269
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,040
and

1270
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,640
uh you know that way we can avoid

1271
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240
problems with the

1272
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,760
supposedly we avoid problems with the

1273
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
nit checkers

1274
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,559
and stuff like that

1275
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,920
so uh

1276
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,760
just a word to the wise

1277
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,720
um

1278
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,040
you know there's address space allocated

1279
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,400
for benchmarking

1280
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,040
in

1281
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,079
both v4 and v6

1282
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,280
however

1283
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,160
these other changes i use the

1284
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,200
private range to expect that it is

1285
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,839
the stateful n83 which most people know

1286
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,119
at home

1287
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,319
this type of series

1288
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,319
okay

1289
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,720
it was intentional

1290
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,880
i just wanted to expect some information

1291
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,599
but using private rp version 4cs

1292
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,400
okay

1293
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
so

1294
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,520
okay

1295
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,839
um

1296
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,559
and um

1297
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,400
yeah edward has uh

1298
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,319
edward has put in some additional

1299
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,680
comments there

1300
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,800
uh identifying the slash 48

1301
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,760
uh

1302
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,800
for um

1303
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,559
bmwg use

1304
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,000
with v6

1305
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,400
so thank you

1306
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,680
all right

1307
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,399
so um

1308
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,359
let's see

1309
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
did uh oh i see somebody at the

1310
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,880
microphone here

1311
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,240
um

1312
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,640
and then the problem is i've got like oh

1313
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,200
yeah oh there's two people so

1314
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,359
i think i think the first one in the

1315
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,400
queue is uh is uh thomas

1316
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,359
uh

1317
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,599
go ahead uh thomas

1318
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,480
uh thank you very much uh

1319
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,200
i just would like to briefly inform this

1320
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,800
community

1321
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,079
that

1322
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,280
i am an fpga expert and i recently

1323
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,640
joined to the changi university

1324
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,680
activities on the subject in fact mr

1325
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,440
lynch's team

1326
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,880
and my

1327
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,400
project will be to implement the

1328
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,440
currently running cperf and other

1329
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,800
softwares and fpga environment sorry

1330
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,680
about this unusual demo but i'm showing

1331
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,040
you a development board

1332
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,559
from xilinx what we found

1333
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,960
kind of promising

1334
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,400
because it has proper speed ports you

1335
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,960
can see this link up here

1336
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,760
which can link in fact there are four

1337
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,800
ports like that

1338
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,119
and it sounds like with small

1339
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,079
modification this development board is

1340
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,640
appropriate to start

1341
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,960
to re-implement

1342
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,200
the currently running the

1343
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,079
project in a different framework which

1344
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,480
is fbga based

1345
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,160
and the expectation is that we are going

1346
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
to

1347
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,280
implement all the features what gabor

1348
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,720
just mentioned

1349
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,880
in this presentation

1350
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,160
and even the performance

1351
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,040
will be much higher unfortunately at

1352
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,280
this point i cannot

1353
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,920
give you any exact numbers or estimates

1354
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,480
because we are right at the beginning of

1355
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
this project we are

1356
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,520
fighting with the drivers and the

1357
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,319
implementation of the dpdk

1358
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,280
features and so on probably within a

1359
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,400
couple of months we can tell you much

1360
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,960
more and maybe give you a presentation

1361
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
about the results of this project

1362
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,599
thank you very much that's all i wanted

1363
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,040
to say

1364
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,079
very good thanks for your report thomas

1365
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,359
and um

1366
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,000
uh well let's make sure that uh there's

1367
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,760
always kind of like an implementation

1368
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,720
section

1369
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,160
in the drafts

1370
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,359
uh that should uh you know have

1371
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,800
some sort of reference to what you're

1372
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,920
doing there

1373
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,319
and uh that makes it easy for us

1374
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,920
to find it what we're talking about yeah

1375
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,200
okay

1376
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,599
kind of the end game here when um

1377
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,200
uh you know eventually when we get to

1378
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,839
approval but i think that's that's the

1379
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,480
ultimate kind of support for the trap

1380
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,160
that somebody's burning these things at

1381
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,680
the fbgas

1382
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,839
all

1383
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,240
right you

1384
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,960
thank you

1385
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,880
okay uh

1386
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,680
timothy i think you're next

1387
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,440
hi tim winners qa cafe um i i want to

1388
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,200
answer two of these questions

1389
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,640
one of them is i i do think this should

1390
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,640
be a working group document

1391
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,520
um

1392
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,040
support that and then the second part of

1393
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,440
this is i want to review this for the

1394
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,200
metrics missing

1395
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,119
so as part of that process i'll take a

1396
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,559
long look at this

1397
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,920
we do a lot of testing of stateful

1398
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,000
gateways i'm sure there's some

1399
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,599
we can put some thought into this on our

1400
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,559
side so um i'll put my name down to

1401
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,079
review this draft as part of the

1402
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,559
adoption process

1403
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,079
thanks very much

1404
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,119
tim

1405
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,079
um

1406
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,880
i appreciate you stepping forward to uh

1407
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,880
to jump in and join us

1408
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,040
um this is your first time with bmwt

1409
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,000
no no no i used to do a lot of netsec

1410
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
open um

1411
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,280
used to work with brian and some of that

1412
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,040
stuff i've been a participant for some

1413
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,680
time in a variety of different ways

1414
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,240
yeah yeah i thought i i thought i

1415
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,839
recognized you but

1416
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,319
the picture is really small from here

1417
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,839
so um and i see you got your v6 uh

1418
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,319
t-shirt on there

1419
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,799
so thank you

1420
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,920
okay

1421
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,280
well um

1422
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,559
i think that

1423
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,680
you know

1424
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,000
my goal of um

1425
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,880
kind of

1426
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,920
extending the importance of adoption

1427
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,480
uh through the live meeting here

1428
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,240
has kind of been met

1429
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,599
we've seen a number of uh people

1430
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,880
respond

1431
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,839
after the original document of the

1432
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,240
original the adoption period closed

1433
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,119
and uh of course i was one of them and i

1434
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,240
think a total of four after after the

1435
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,599
period closed

1436
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,920
so um and then a couple i think before

1437
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,880
it closed

1438
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,720
so that that feels to me like we're

1439
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,640
going to have enough people paying

1440
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,000
attention here

1441
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,760
uh for a view to make this uh

1442
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,240
adopt this as a as a working group

1443
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,559
document

1444
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,640
anything anything you want to say on

1445
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,400
this topic uh sarah

1446
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,680
yeah i agree i also am a little tardy

1447
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,240
with my replies and i had giving gabor

1448
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,559
the feedback that i would do that today

1449
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,720
and i agree there's a lot of

1450
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,520
enough interest here to adopt this

1451
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,920
uh on list and again thank you timothy

1452
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,839
for the

1453
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,520
the extra attention you're going to put

1454
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,000
on this as well well excited to see this

1455
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,200
move forward good job y'all

1456
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,839
great thank you

1457
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,760
okay

1458

so that's uh that's a good thing

1459
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,280
close the deck here all right

1460
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,240
okay

1461
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,680
so then

1462
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,520
our next topic up

1463
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,079
is uh the proposals

1464
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,359
and um

1465
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,599
uh now we're going to see uh

1466
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,400
a couple of related drafts

1467
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,520
on uh

1468
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,720
segment routing the first one is on uh

1469
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,799
mpls segment routing and today uh

1470
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,960
apollo volpado

1471
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,079
uh will be

1472
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,520
uh presenting the draft uh paulo uh

1473
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,000
uh this is your first time uh

1474

00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
i am with huawei

1482
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,880
i'm presenting this draft on behalf of

1483
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,599
the authors you see listed here so

1484
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,160
people from huawei and telefonica luiz

1485
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,240
by the way is sitting at the back of the

1486
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,079
room and

1487
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,040
said by ali it's my first appearance at

1488
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,440
the benchmarking working group so i'm

1489
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,920
happy to be here and hopefully this is

1490
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,640
the start of a long cooperation

1491
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,480
so next slide please

1492
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,119
okay

1493
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,720
so just to give you a bit of the

1494
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,799
background of this draft and also

1495
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:39,599
of

1496
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,599
the other that my colleague edward will

1497
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,520
present uh

1498
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,480
just

1499
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,480
in a few minutes so we started from rfc

1500
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,520
5695 so basically this is the

1501
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,599
benchmarking for a

1502
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,319
an mpls capable

1503
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,880
device

1504
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,559
let's say that that is for pure if i may

1505
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,119
use this word mpls so there is no

1506
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,920
mention of sr mpls which is the topic we

1507
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,680
are interested in

1508
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,640
uh so we combined sad capability of

1509
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,960
5695 together with the

1510
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,280
architectural framework of segment

1511
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,640
routing and specifically the sr mpls

1512
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,640
flavor of semi-rooting defined by rfc

1513
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,480
8402

1514
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,079
um

1515
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,200
trying to provide a method for

1516
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,200
benchmarking nasara mpls capable device

1517
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,640
so we need to let's say complement 5695

1518
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,680
with

1519
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,760
some more let's say

1520
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,680
mechanisms some more

1521
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,200
procedures so that's why we uh provided

1522
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,960
this draft

1523
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,359
dedicated to the benchmarking of sr and

1524
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,040
pls and clearly we based our work on

1525
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,640
um 25 44 in the newer

1526
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,160
1904

1527
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,400
so that is for the background

1528
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,920
we are aware that at the moment there

1529
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,680
are no other

1530
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,319
efforts ongoing

1531
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,680
so that's why we developed such

1532
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,400
proposals moving to the next slide

1533
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,359
please

1534
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,240
just a just a question there apollo

1535
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,240
uh when when you guys were thinking

1536
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,079
about filling this gap

1537
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,040
was um was anyone asking for

1538
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,000
um

1539
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,760
uh benchmarking

1540
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,240
of uh products in the in the segment

1541
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,680
crowding space

1542
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,799
that um

1543
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,960
you know caused you to uh

1544
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,000
want to do the work more formally

1545
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,280
uh i'm not sure i got properly your

1546
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,960
question so

1547
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,839
it was about the availability in the

1548
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,480
benchmarking world group

1549
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,280
no is it it's more like it's more like

1550
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,240
um

1551
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,119
where people asking for benchmarking

1552
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,240
um

1553
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,799
you know to benchmark their products or

1554
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,440
testing the products without doing

1555
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,400
formal benchmarking uh to this to the

1556
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,520
need did you guys recognize a need uh

1557
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,000
from the industry as well as a gap

1558
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,880
oh yes the answer is definitely yes

1559
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,839
and

1560
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,680
at least

1561
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,839
clearly i can speak it just for let's

1562
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,480
say uh the two organizations that for

1563
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,400
the moment support the drafts of

1564
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,559
telefonica and huawei

1565
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,319
if you just consider

1566
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,400
huawei as a vendor telefonica is an

1567
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,520
operator as an operator we definitely

1568
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,799
think that

1569
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,000
this

1570
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,839
effort is worth you know our work

1571
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,799
we are filling a gap in the industry

1572
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:47,760
and

1573
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,000
that's why we are proposing such topic

1574
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,359
here but of course we are open to any

1575
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,160
feedback from you as i said uh i'm quite

1576
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,720
new to the to the work group so probably

1577
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,280
uh i'm still a bit uh

1578
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,880
fresh to this extent so i'm really

1579
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,680
happy to take also your uh

1580
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,240
your feedback

1581
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,440
sure

1582
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,319
just i'm really just checking on um you

1583
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:15,440
know that

1584
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,000
really we need more than a gap in the

1585
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,079
bmw g literature

1586
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,640
uh to kind of get things going and and i

1587
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,240
think you've kind of answered the

1588
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,680
question that uh

1589
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,400
you know if an operator and a supplier

1590
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,480
see the need to do this that's a good

1591
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,200
place to start

1592
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,920
sure

1593
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,880
okay changes from the uh previous

1594
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,359
version we presented version zero one in

1595
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,760
vienna so at the itf 113

1596
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,240
we received quite a few comments in

1597
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,280
particular from the chairs and we we

1598
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,119
thank the chairs we acknowledge the

1599
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,119
value of those comments

1600
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,599
just to be very quick on my recap we

1601
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,480
reviewed the test methodology because

1602
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,280
probably was still missing at that time

1603
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,520
so in the first version of our draft

1604
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,440
we also added

1605
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,839
let's say

1606
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,640
some more capability i would say so

1607
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,119
we develop new sections on

1608
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,319
the protocol addresses the duration of a

1609
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,359
test

1610
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,480
how to verify it

1611
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,280
we developed further let's say

1612
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,160
considerations to be connected with as i

1613
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,200
said

1614
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,439
rfc 5695 and 2544

1615
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,760
and by the way we have also put

1616
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,760
references to um rfc 904 and also the

1617
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,839
work done by etsy about the

1618
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,520
virtualization

1619
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,039
of

1620
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,839
some functions where you may also employ

1621
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:55,520
segment routing

1622
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,599
and by the way for the moment we have

1623
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,480
decided to let's say leave out of the

1624
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,520
scope

1625
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,079
the transport of services

1626
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,440
on top of

1627
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,280
let's say

1628
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,319
in sr mpls connection so as you see for

1629
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,000
the moment we are not considering for

1630
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,119
example

1631
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,359
the benchmarking of a service such as a

1632
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,599
vpn or

1633
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,920
also we need to say

1634
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,000
for the moment we are not considering

1635
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,160
traffic engineering based on sr mpls

1636
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:26,960
uh

1637
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,960
next slide please

1638
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,000
oh one

1639
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,039
one comment on this

1640
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,920
the one reference to um

1641
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,119
the etsy

1642
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:39,920
uh

1643
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,440
test document

1644
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,119
that should actually be

1645
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,440
uh tst009

1646
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,799
the

1647
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,559
testers or seven

1648
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,240
is a uh

1649
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,799
conformance and interoperability

1650
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,079
uh spec

1651
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,359
whereas uh uh testers or nine

1652
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,359
uh comes up in the draft

1653
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,880
as uh

1654
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,520
getting some help for when the um

1655
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,640
the uh

1656
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,039
the yes the segment routing device under

1657
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,760
test is virtualized

1658
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,000
and um

1659
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,559
test09

1660
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,799
um it's basically it's basically rfc

1661
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,359
2544

1662
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,160
uh for virtualized uh

1663
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,440
devices under test in the um you know in

1664
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,359
the virtual machine and the

1665
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,760
containerized world so

1666
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,599
i'll just try to set you straight on on

1667
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,440
that for the moment

1668
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,680
but please take a look at that because i

1669
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,799
think there's a lot of good advice there

1670
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,079
okay thank you

1671
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:40,960
we will

1672
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,240
correct that

1673
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,240
sure

1674
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,760
okay next slide

1675
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,119
right

1676
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,039
okay so as i mentioned

1677
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,480
we

1678
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,000
have tried to develop further the

1679
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,880
content test setup well let's say that

1680
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
we need to augment what is already

1681
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,359
defined by 2544

1682
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,160
and also the the let's say the

1683
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,000
basic the base

1684
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,680
paper on mpls

1685
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,960
first

1686
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,599
we have to let's see

1687
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,200
continue following the approach of

1688
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,880
having multiple

1689
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,079
ports

1690
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,160
on our device

1691
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,000
so the

1692
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
packet forwarding engine

1693
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,720
may distribute packets across all the

1694
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,000
ports

1695
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,960
we have also to take into consideration

1696
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,000
um let's say

1697
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,880
aspects such as over subscription so we

1698
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,960
have to take let's say care of that

1699
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,280
the idea is that the test should be

1700
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,400
bi-directional but clearly one as the

1701
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,799
option to let's say to split

1702
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,359
the upstream from the downstream uh

1703
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,000
flows

1704
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,119
and then as also uh suggested by the

1705
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,000
chair

1706
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,920
let's say that even if it's not fully

1707
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,680
developed at the current stage we have

1708
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,400
also to consider the availability of a

1709
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,880
virtual machine so the softwareized

1710
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,039
version of a function handling

1711
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:14,480
srmpls-based packets

1712
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,040
this is for the test setup

1713
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,399
moving to the next slide

1714
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:21,920
okay

1715
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,479
we have also let's say to consider

1716
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,920
uh something that it's useful for the

1717
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,080
industry so this is one of the reasons

1718
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,759
why we see the gap

1719
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,439
at the moment for

1720
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:36,640
not having let's say a benchmarking

1721
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,000
guideline for sr mpls and as i said also

1722
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,040
services later explained by edward

1723
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,640
so

1724
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,719
for running the test we need to let's

1725
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,960
say

1726
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,759
choose a protocol for label distribution

1727
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,040
so we have

1728
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,319
provided a list for test could be igp

1729
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,520
bgp or other ways to let's say

1730
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,799
distribute the policies

1731
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,479
differently from 5695

1732
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,520
we

1733
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,960
will consider

1734
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,359
more than one label

1735
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,359
and the reason is that

1736
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,799
let's say

1737
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,799
otherwise we are not fully exploiting

1738
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:20,479
the capability of srm pls it is true to

1739
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,000
do so we should have in mind let's say a

1740
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,120
service

1741
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,198
but for

1742
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,799
being ready to support all the

1743
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,439
capabilities supported by srm pls the

1744
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,679
idea is to have at least

1745
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,238
two labels corresponding to two seeds

1746
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,759
two segment identifiers

1747
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,279
such that the outer label

1748
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,600
will be in the future considered as the

1749
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,520
entry point for carrying a service as i

1750
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,719
said

1751
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,080
and then we have also to let's say

1752
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,679
deal with

1753
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,719
a the mtu of the packet clearly we need

1754
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,400
to consider

1755
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,920
uh four bytes per label so that's why as

1756
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,360
you see here

1757
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,880
uh we

1758
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
we have to add

1759
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,760
at least five bytes more to the packet

1760
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,239
because uh differently from the base

1761
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,040
mpls we have two seeds so two labels so

1762
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,360
basically eight bytes for

1763
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,320
the label stack

1764
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,960
it's good to um

1765
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,159
it's good to uh calculate or to to

1766
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:31,080
catalog these differences from

1767
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,400
56.95 and why you've uh why you've had

1768
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,920
to make these choices

1769
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,040
that's uh

1770
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,000
uh excellent material uh please continue

1771
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,560
sorry for the interruption

1772
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,800
okay thanks

1773
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,920
so

1774
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,320
moving to the next slide please

1775
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,840
uh

1776
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,480
clearly we have also to think about how

1777
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,760
to provide the result of the test so for

1778
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,840
the reporting format

1779
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,719
uh

1780
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,360
new parameters have to be considered you

1781
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,800
see the full list

1782
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,199
so just to let's say

1783
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:13,280
going very quickly through the items

1784
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,880
the number of

1785
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,199
ports we are using for the test as i

1786
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,840
said we need to consider the

1787
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,600
full capability of the packet for

1788
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,920
warning entry and maybe also over

1789
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,360
subscription

1790
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,440
the

1791
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,480
possible differences between upstream

1792
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,880
and downstream so the proportion of the

1793
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,360
traffic we split between the two

1794
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,480
what types of srmpls operation we are

1795
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,880
dealing with um

1796
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,440
probably you are already aware srmpls is

1797
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,880
based on three

1798
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,120
operations push next continue we will

1799
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,640
discuss in the next slide but just to

1800
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,159
anticipate the topic

1801
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,880
basically they are corresponding to the

1802
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,560
um

1803
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,360
different operations supported today by

1804
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,360
base mpls

1805
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,679
with some let's say differences

1806
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,800
uh the number of labels so the the depth

1807
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,520
of the protocol of the label stack so as

1808
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,840
i said at least two

1809
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,000
two seeds two labels

1810
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,679
how we

1811
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,960
instruct the device to build

1812
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,840
the label stack so we need to also take

1813
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,760
care of the policy

1814
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,440
that should be considered within the

1815
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,760
framework of the test

1816
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,600
the type of the payload

1817
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,679
the um

1818
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,000
the protocol used for label distribution

1819
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,440
and clearly if

1820
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,719
there is maybe

1821
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,640
somebody interested with that

1822
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,080
we

1823
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,400
take for granted that we are using just

1824
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,159
ethernet connectivity but in case

1825
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,719
other let's say media formats can also

1826
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,840
be

1827
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,640
used i will say next slide unless there

1828
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,840
are questions here

1829
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,880
and as i said um

1830
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,440
srm pls is based on three fundamental

1831
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,840
operations the push operation is

1832
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,880
corresponding as the name implies to the

1833
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,080
label push so basically we instruct

1834
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,960
the device of

1835
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,080
putting in front of the packet

1836
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,280
couple of labels so to

1837
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,880
to let's say

1838
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,840
place as the overhead of the packet a

1839
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,480
label stack the next correspond to the

1840
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,320
label pop-up so

1841
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,920
as it happens in

1842
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,239
base mpls today and then they continue

1843
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,159
which is let's say the equivalent of the

1844
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,960
label swap

1845
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,000
clearly we have to take care of these

1846
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,600
specific differences with let's say the

1847
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,360
normal behavior of srm pls and this

1848
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,760
should be also reported

1849
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,320
in the result of the test

1850
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,960
to be clear

1851
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,080
clearly more let's say more information

1852
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,760
can be found in rfc 8402 the basic

1853
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,719
architecture of the southern pales

1854
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,679
and i will say that's it so we can move

1855
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,679
to the next slide which is our

1856
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,600
conclusion

1857
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,960
basically we'd like to let's say

1858
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,719
uh listen for you

1859
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,400
if there is interest

1860
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,320
in working on such item so when we say

1861
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,199
if the benchmarking war group is happy

1862
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,920
to consider the adoption of these let's

1863
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,120
say

1864
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,360
of this paper is not just to

1865
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,840
the formal adoption of the draft but to

1866
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,239
see whether there is consensus in moving

1867
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,600
on with

1868
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,120
having a

1869
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,480
a paper specifically devoted to srm pls

1870
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,000
any input any feedback is really

1871
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,480
appreciated and by the way we are also

1872
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,280
open to cooperation if anyone wishes to

1873
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,120
join us as co-author there is this

1874
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,640
possibility

1875
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,120
and i would say this is it for for now

1876
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,960
thank you very good

1877
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,120
thank you

1878
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,679
so um paulo you've asked

1879
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,520
the right questions here

1880
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,120
the um

1881
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,800
we really need some folks in in bmw g

1882
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,080
to step up

1883
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,000
and basically to say

1884
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,320
um you know i've read the draft uh it's

1885
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,760
a decent draft

1886
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,360
and provide some comments but um

1887
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,760
first thing i'll say is uh

1888
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,640
it was

1889
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,719
it was really good to see

1890
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,120
how the how your draft

1891
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,640
improved from

1892
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,239
the current version

1893
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,800
from the last version you really stepped

1894
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,239
up to adopt

1895
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,000
the um

1896
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,800
uh

1897
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,960
you know the the material that was

1898
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,000
available

1899
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,480
in the bmw literature

1900
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,960
and that was a great improvement so

1901
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,480
thanks for doing that

1902
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,800
that was based on the comments from last

1903
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,040
time around

1904
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,239
so um does anybody volunteer to review

1905
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,120
the draft today

1906
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,800
or you know like

1907
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,159
clear the draft for the future

1908
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,600
i see a request from boris

1909
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,360
yes

1910
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,520
so i recently tested

1911
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,679
sr policy

1912
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,480
with different vendors so i can review

1913
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,520
this section and provide feedback a bit

1914
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,800
later

1915
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,040
after 8 years

1916
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,040
that's great thanks very much

1917
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,880
thank you boris

1918
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,679
okay um anybody else

1919
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
all right well i mean that sounds like

1920
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,239
pretty knowledgeable feedback

1921
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,640
uh today paulo so

1922
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,199
maybe when uh boris uh posts his

1923
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,440
comments uh it will draw the interest of

1924
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,840
others as well

1925
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,000
so uh thank you to

1926
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,800
your co-authors and

1927
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,400
contributors here for a nice piece of

1928
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,639
work

1929
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,960
thank you

1930
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,000
all right

1931
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,480
now i see

1932
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,360
now i think i see edward joining us by

1933
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,440
video is that correct yes

1934
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,840
yes welcome

1935
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,920
good day everybody

1936
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,360
um about um our second slide deck uh

1937
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,960
because uh

1938
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,199
the same people have developed the same

1939
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,600
two drafts for the reason the style is

1940
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,760
the same the scope is the same but the

1941
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,600
technology is a little bit different for

1942
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,280
that reason the text is a little bit

1943
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,640
different because

1944
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,880
srv6 is is a little bit different from

1945
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,320
srmpls

1946
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,400
um i would like for start to answer a

1947
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,400
question from our chair about is it

1948
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,560
really important uh

1949
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,080
i could prove that

1950
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,040
for srmpls it's even too late uh why i

1951
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,280
believe it's it's it's it's even late

1952
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,560
because look uh about a few thousands

1953
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,040
maybe two two point five thousands of

1954
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,400
telco already has moved uh from uh old

1955
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,159
style mpls to srmpls and

1956
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,480
for telco world it's typically uh

1957
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,480
important and is typically mandatory to

1958
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,600
test

1959
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,239
any new technology before adoption and

1960
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,719
for that reason already about 2.5

1961
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,719
thousands of tests for srm pls did

1962
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,679
happen

1963
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,239
and it means that we are a little bit

1964
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,120
late with our test test plan

1965
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,159
um

1966
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,640
for a service 6 situation is not so

1967
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,320
urgent it's a little bit better because

1968
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,239
for service 6 we know that worldwide

1969
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,000
already 250 something like 250 projects

1970
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,080
in developments some projects already in

1971
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,760
production style

1972
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,320
state some projects are still in test

1973
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,400
and preparation but it's 250 now and 250

1974
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,560
tests already has been done for a srv6

1975
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,800
it's probably means that 250 tests

1976
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,040
already done worldwide it probably means

1977
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,199
that we need a test plan we need

1978
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,120
benchmark methodology to explain how to

1979
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,199
do properly this test plan and for that

1980
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,070
reason it's probably a good um

1981
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,719
[Music]

1982
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,520
a good evidence that if 250 tests

1983
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,920
already has been done probably should be

1984
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,560
the discussion in atf about how to do it

1985
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,920
properly

1986
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,880
next slide please

1987
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,280
thanks for that perspective

1988
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,480
edward

1989
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,440
um

1990
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,960
okay

1991
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,719
about the basement here the basement

1992
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,320
here is a little bit different because

1993
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,560
of course of course the primary basement

1994
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,760
is our primary benchmark fc 2544 of

1995
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,080
course of course it's a it's really a

1996
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,000
primary one but but

1997
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,719
additionally because service 6 is ipv6

1998
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,719
uh we need to take care uh for lfc 5180

1999
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,560
for ipv6 benchmark

2000
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,880
benchmark methodology

2001
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,920
but

2002
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,080
in reality because it's

2003
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,560
in behavior of services like behavior

2004
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,080
srps

2005
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,920
in reality we need to inherit many

2006
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,159
things from mpls benchmarking from rfc

2007
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:41,440
5695 therefore

2008
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,679
it's it's a mix it's a mix there are

2009
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,120
some number of things which are unique

2010
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,719
for services but

2011
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,560
in fact it's a mix of combination of

2012
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,719
things which is taken from ipv6 and

2013
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,480
which is taken from mpls uh benchmarking

2014
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,000
uh this is

2015
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,159
a little bit different from the previous

2016
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,760
one from mpls one which is more or less

2017
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,400
simply for from that point of view

2018
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,839
next slide please

2019
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,600
we have excluded from the consideration

2020
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,560
because

2021
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,560
from our point of view uh the

2022
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,320
methodology is already

2023
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,760
more or less big i mean draft is more or

2024
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,159
less big and looking to the other drafts

2025
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,320
which we have seen for benchmark working

2026
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,120
group

2027
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,520
we have decided that probably it's

2028
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,600
enough probably we have

2029
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,000
big enough scope and we have excluded

2030
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,040
from the scope uh traffic engineering uh

2031
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,360
uh and we have excluded of course uh

2032
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,000
services vpn services for example

2033
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,960
because

2034
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,120
then the draft would be extremely big

2035
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,199
and uh and as we as we have seen before

2036
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,400
from benchmark

2037
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,560
working group typically such things as

2038
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,639
traffic engineering and services were in

2039
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,719
separate document and for that reason we

2040
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,920
we follow the typical style of benchmark

2041
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,120
working group

2042
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,600
uh from the previous version uh we could

2043
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,400
say that we have changed like facermpls

2044
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,080
here is the same we have changed

2045
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,920
something like from my point of view

2046
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,840
forty percentage for zero forty

2047
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,159
percentage of text has been changed we

2048
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,159
really did a major major change if

2049
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,239
somebody has read it before forget about

2050
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,239
it and read again because we have really

2051
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,719
changed a lot

2052
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,360
next slide

2053
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,560
please okay uh what is really maybe new

2054
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,600
here um you may be different from mpls

2055
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,840
and ipv6 benchmarking

2056
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,520
um

2057
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,560
as for all other benchmarking rfc we

2058
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,880
assume that configuration of label stack

2059
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,520
or seed stack here

2060
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,960
will be

2061
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,040
automatic will be by some

2062
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,320
protocol isis or spf or maybe segment

2063
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,400
routing policy which is effectively

2064
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,440
bgp or pc pc

2065
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,480
pcp

2066
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,320
we assume that it's not manual

2067
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,679
configuration of course it's possible

2068
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,320
manual uh we permit it uh as an option

2069
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,760
but uh

2070
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,239
we recommend that it should be

2071
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,159
it should look like a real situation

2072
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,159
should look like a real protocol will

2073
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,159
populate prop tables

2074
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,840
uh like for previous srmpls here for

2075
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,480
services of course we are trying to ask

2076
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,040
that recommended way to insert at least

2077
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,400
two seeds at least

2078
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,480
stack from two seed because if it's just

2079
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,440
one seed it's it's not a stack it's

2080
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,400
it's not it look it looks not reasonable

2081
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,800
but but here there is a big difference

2082
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,600
between the service six and sr mpls

2083
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,440
because uh in the 7pls every label uh

2084
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,679
every seed every label mpls label will

2085
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,760
give you just uh one hop

2086
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,000
or one interface it's

2087
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,719
a

2088
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,000
it's it's really

2089
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,400
one next scope one next interface

2090
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,520
in

2091
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,199
v6 case uh it could be two because in in

2092
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,120
in service six um the seed could be

2093
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,520
splitted for three parts and first part

2094
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,400
is a node next part is a function

2095
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,400
the last part argument is not is not

2096
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,320
important right now but the first part

2097
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,639
could be the node and it's it's already

2098
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,719
the instruction where to forward

2099
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,360
uh but after the node part inside the

2100
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,199
same seat could be the part which is

2101
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,360
responsible for so-called function and

2102
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,159
sometimes sometimes function especially

2103
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,320
for traffic engineering could could have

2104
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,440
name and dot x for example and if it's

2105
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,440
n.x it's effectively

2106
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,480
the number

2107
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,239
it's next scope interface number it's

2108
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,679
effectively next next next interface

2109
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,320
and then it means that effectively one

2110
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,120
seat has uh two instructions one how to

2111
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,280
reach the node and one how to go out of

2112
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,920
this node on the next scope and um

2113
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,520
because it's not related to services

2114
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,199
it's related to infrastructure we have

2115
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,600
decided despite that it is a little bit

2116
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,440
traffic engineering it's it's used for

2117
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
traffic engineering we have decided to

2118
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,840
include it in the consideration we have

2119
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,639
included it in in the discussion uh it's

2120
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,040
a little bit disputable because look

2121
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,280
it's it's not services okay it's fine

2122
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,360
but it's for traffic engineering in the

2123
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,760
future but we have included this because

2124
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,000
without this uh it's not proper test

2125
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,040
from our point of view of srv6

2126
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,080
uh of course we have um corrected uh

2127
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,760
here the side um

2128
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,199
mtu and heather sizes because here uh we

2129
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,800
have additional heaters uh uh eight uh

2130
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,520
bytes uh for srh heater itself and the

2131
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,400
additional

2132
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,639
16 bytes for every seat for for every

2133
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,239
ipv6 address which is inserted in uh

2134
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,800
inside and if people will would like to

2135
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,400
test more than two seats for example

2136
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,360
it's optional but it's possible then

2137
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,360
the header could be could be big and we

2138
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,199
have calculated properly and put

2139
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:44,639
recommendation

2140
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,239
about this point that the size is

2141
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:47,440
different

2142
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,719
okay go next

2143
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,199
okay um of course because uh we have

2144
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,880
included here a little bit additional

2145
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,800
discussion about um

2146
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,030
upstream downstream proportion about uh

2147
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,280
[Music]

2148
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,280
relationship between port numbers and

2149
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,639
pep because

2150
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,360
look in the current world

2151
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,719
there is no one-to-one relationship

2152
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,800
between port

2153
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,080
device port

2154
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,960
device under test port and pc

2155
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,120
typically one pv is capable to serve a

2156
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,760
few ports and uh to really test

2157
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,800
something

2158
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,600
on modern box you need to really test

2159
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,639
all ports related to one pc you really

2160
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,520
need to stress one pt because the pvp is

2161
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,120
very flexible if you will stress just

2162
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,520
one port the pv will throw to you much

2163
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,080
more buffers you will test wrong numbers

2164
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
because you will get much better latency

2165
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,679
much better performance than it's

2166
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,040
possible for

2167
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,159
for load

2168
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,199
when all pv ports are loaded and for the

2169
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,360
reason we have a discussion inside that

2170
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,880
okay we have a discussion how to

2171
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,199
understand uh what is the relationship

2172
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,000
between uh ports and pve because

2173
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
in fact you need to stress not port you

2174
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,159
need to stress pv and

2175
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,760
after you will stress pt of course you

2176
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,520
need to document which one particular

2177
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,199
port has been used

2178
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,080
uh

2179
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,600
the same discussion about armstrong

2180
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,719
upstream downstream uh like before and

2181
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:13,600
uh

2182
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,120
here we have a little bit again

2183
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,840
different names which is used for

2184
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,639
srv6 operations for that reason uh it

2185
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,800
has been reflected in the document and

2186
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,120
of course uh number of seats

2187
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,320
seats

2188
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,800
how big seed stack should be documented

2189
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,360
of course and what particular protocol

2190
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,600
has been used to populate seed stack is

2191
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,080
of course uh should be discussed and for

2192
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,560
that reason the reporting

2193
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,679
points uh a little bit extended because

2194
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,040
it's like for sr mpls more points to uh

2195
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,639
to mention

2196
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,520
next slide please

2197
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,280
uh

2198
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,600
for six the terminology again has

2199
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,320
changed a little bit

2200
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,000
it's very it's very similar to what we

2201
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,040
have for mpls but a little bit different

2202
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,120
here we have so called source node uh

2203
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,080
which really creates a seed stack and hd

2204
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,120
srh header okay fine then we have uh

2205
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,199
endpoint node endpoint in reality is not

2206
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,920
final final end it's a intermediate end

2207
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,600
point i would say because

2208
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,600
what it means it means that this is this

2209
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,719
endpoint

2210
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,440
uh will change the destination address

2211
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,560
will copy

2212
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,880
address from

2213
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,320
top of uh for from from the point of srh

2214
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,360
and uh

2215
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,840
change the pointer uh to next one it's

2216
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,040
effectively

2217
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,880
like like swap swap operation but there

2218
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,560
is no here swap operation because in the

2219
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
middle we don't change headers we just

2220
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,440
change destination address and we change

2221
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,800
entry entry point in the srh stack and

2222
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,560
transit node transit node is something

2223
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,199
new uh not not present is is a srmpls

2224
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,520
because transit node is a just ordinary

2225
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,880
ipv6 node which may not understand srv6

2226
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,679
at all just ipv6 and transit node just

2227
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,679
look to destination address and forward

2228
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,199
the only thing which is important for

2229
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,000
transit node not to drop the packet

2230
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,239
which has bigger headers so a bigger mtu

2231
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:12,000
because

2232
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,159
additionally srh heater is attached and

2233
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,840
transit node just should not pay any

2234
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
attention to this uh srh here the

2235
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,320
routing header because

2236
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,520
he is not

2237
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,199
transit node is not destination for this

2238
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,280
particular srh but anyway it should be

2239
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,199
tested because performance may be affect

2240
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,360
affected additional heater extension

2241
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,760
here the performance may be affected

2242
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,520
everything may be affected for the

2243
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,360
reason it should be tested

2244
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,159
uh

2245
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:40,879
okay probably that's it next slide

2246
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,400
okay uh

2247
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,880
because we really spent

2248
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,880
more or less big amount of time and we

2249
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,600
did everything possible

2250
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,159
we have changed a lot the draft

2251
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,480
in reality we don't have any more idea

2252
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,840
what to dd

2253
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,800
we have investigated all

2254
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,679
potentially potentially related rfc from

2255
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:04,960
benchmark working group and all

2256
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,960
potentially related uh

2257
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,040
revision drafts from spring working

2258
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,199
group and a few other related working

2259
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:13,120
groups to understand the full picture to

2260
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,199
not to miss anything not to miss some

2261
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,280
some important things but after such

2262
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,880
investigation we have populated

2263
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,800
everything in the draft and and now we

2264
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
don't have an idea how to improve it

2265
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,080
better

2266
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,760
and for that reason

2267
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,600
any input is very welcome and

2268
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,920
maybe it's a time for adoption

2269
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,480
because in general it's it's needed

2270
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,360
i mean

2271
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,040
the problem exists and because the

2272
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,639
problem exists the text of course could

2273
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,400
be could be discussed of course if

2274
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,320
somebody believed that somebody

2275
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,600
should be changed of course we will

2276
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,239
change no no no no question but

2277
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,320
it looks like we did everything possible

2278
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,840
at least for people who who really

2279
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,239
participated in this

2280
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,760
so um thank you edward uh let me ask a

2281
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,400
follow up to your final response there

2282
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,440
um

2283
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,600
have you um

2284
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,520
have you done any testing

2285
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,280
uh with the procedures that you've

2286
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,880
currently outlined in the draft

2287
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,560
uh not exactly for this one uh but uh

2288
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,400
i have participated in a couple of tests

2289
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,280
of srv6

2290
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,600
but because typically

2291
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,480
different telco different carriers they

2292
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,960
have different requirements uh what they

2293
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,960
would like to test and and for that

2294
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,480
reason

2295
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,320
it's not exactly it's not exactly the

2296
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,239
same the similarity may be

2297
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,800
maybe 40 or 50 percentage

2298
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,440
uh this one is more or less general and

2299
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,040
in particular situation people would

2300
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,960
like no particular things for that

2301
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,880
reason i would not say exactly the same

2302
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,840
but maybe 50 percentage

2303
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,800
okay

2304
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,320
so maybe um

2305
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,120
maybe maybe one of the things we could

2306
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,239
encourage

2307
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,639
is for people to try out this

2308
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,679
this version of testing

2309
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,199
and uh

2310
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,760
that will reveal the kind of the areas

2311
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,400
for um additional development that

2312
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,920
you're looking at

2313
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,280
and then of course

2314
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,080
um

2315
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,600
you know anybody is

2316
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,080
welcome to read this and and provide

2317
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,719
comments uh based on their their

2318
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,120
previous testing experience

2319
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,280
so there's really really two sources

2320
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,760
where we might get uh the inputs that

2321
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,520
you're looking for

2322
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,800
so um let me open it up to the floor now

2323
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,480
is anyone willing to

2324
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,280
um

2325
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,080
sort of try this draft out in uh you

2326
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,120
know on the test bench or um

2327
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,120
is anybody willing to uh

2328
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,080
just

2329
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,840
just review it and provide comments

2330
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,719
okay

2331
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,159
uh louise

2332
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,199
uh please go ahead

2333
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:00,719
yes hello

2334
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,000
so uh well and go for the draft uh we

2335
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,920
are planning some testing after the

2336
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,760
summer in europe and uh

2337
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,199
to be honest

2338
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,120
by now the

2339
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,120
we don't have yet uh

2340
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,199
a clear mapping of the the the what we

2341
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,040
can do in the from the draft to the

2342
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,960
testing but well the idea or the

2343
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,440
commitment that i comment here

2344
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,360
would be to trying to match what we will

2345
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,760
do with what is in the draft and report

2346
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,679
probably uh coming back for itf-115

2347
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,600
reporting what we did and and what is

2348
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,920
then we we use the content container

2349
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,320
on that testing that will be done in the

2350
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,040
lab okay

2351
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,360
very good thanks louise

2352
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,679
thank you

2353
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,000
and uh gabor

2354
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,840
yes thank you i would like to read the

2355
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,000
draft but please give me let's say two

2356
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,199
months because i'm very busy now

2357
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,480
i would like to read and commend the

2358
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,880
draft on the mailing list

2359
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,159
yeah

2360
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,679

uh at

2376
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,199
edward

2377
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,880
and the team

2378
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,440
so um oh when i see somebody else at the

2379
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,600
at the microphone there

2380
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,480
hi um i was wondering if there was any

2381
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,480
current examples of

2382
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,600
of the of like someone testing this

2383
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:29,239
what's outlined in the rfc draft thanks

2384
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,639
and what was your name i'm sorry

2385
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,920
christine

2386
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:43,840
christine okay

2387
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:50,719
go ahead there um

2388
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:51,600
um

2389
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,119
i don't fully understand the question

2390
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,840
because

2391
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,639
um

2392
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,000
it's it's um more or less new draft and

2393
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,760
exactly this draft has not been tested

2394
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,920
but the people who developed this draft

2395
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,679
has experienced before for different

2396
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,760
many many other different tests and for

2397
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,320
that reason uh we just use our techno

2398
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,960
our knowledge about second places rv6

2399
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,199
and uh we have used our knowledge about

2400
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,119
test itself because tested cell has been

2401
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:18,960
done many times with the for different

2402
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,199
things and we have created a new draft

2403
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:21,920
and

2404
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,760
this exactly new draft

2405
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,760
has never been tested therefore i don't

2406
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,639
understand the question

2407
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,400
i was asking if the current draft had um

2408
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,719
had been tested so

2409
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,159
ah no no

2410
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,159
exactly this one no no has not been

2411
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,080
tested

2412
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,080
thanks

2413
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,920
okay

2414
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,440
um

2415
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,000
any other questions

2416
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,560
all right

2417
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,199
well thank you edward and uh and the

2418
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,719
co-authors again

2419
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,199
for your uh your excellent work here

2420
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,679
much appreciated and thanks everyone for

2421
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:18,480
uh

2422
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,839
contributing to the discussion

2423
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,960
and um yeah boris okay i got that one in

2424
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,400
there too good

2425
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,360
okay

2426
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,280
so let me uh

2427
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,199
i'll close this deck

2428
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,719
i'll uh share my screen here i still

2429
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,159
want to do it

2430
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,960
i want to do screen one

2431
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,440
all right

2432
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,440
all right

2433
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,080
so um

2434
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:49,040
i just wanted to mention a couple of

2435
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,920
items under uh all other business

2436
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,040
um

2437
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,199
a couple of uh a couple of meetings

2438
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,480
essentially

2439
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,440
like two meetings ago we talked about uh

2440
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,280
problems and requirements

2441
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,560
for uh

2442
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,560
um benchmarking um

2443
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,199
the leo clow earth orbit

2444
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:09,920
uh

2445
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,280
space technologies on connections with

2446
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,840
terrestrial

2447
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,719
networks um the authors

2448
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:21,040
uh did not request a spot at this

2449
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:24,159
meeting but they updated the draft uh

2450
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:25,600
back in april

2451
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,719
and i think that kind of reflects the

2452
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,960
fact that there's a lot of interest in

2453
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,920
uh the low earth orbit uh satellite

2454
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,280
communications

2455
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,880
um

2456
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,280
many people probably know that eln

2457
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,360
musk's a company

2458
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,920
has been launching uh satellites like

2459
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,400
crazy

2460
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,239
they're aiming for

2461
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,880
you know really large constellation

2462
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,320
and

2463
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,400
right now the constellations

2464
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,119
are fairly simple

2465
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,960
in terms of what satellite processing

2466
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,199
does

2467
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,119
but that will likely change over time

2468
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,480
so there's some

2469
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,719
you know some some interesting feedback

2470
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,320
to give here if uh

2471
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,719
if you're involved in this work

2472
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,719
and um

2473
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:17,679
also

2474
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:19,679
uh the considerations

2475
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,960
for benchmarking uh network performance

2476
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,440
in containerized infrastructures

2477
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,040
uh that team

2478
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:27,840
um

2479
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,320
i mean really both these author teams

2480
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,960
are in the far east so this is like the

2481
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,320
absolute worst

2482
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,840
time zone for them

2483
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,560
and so they can be forgiven uh for not

2484
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,119
trying to come in and do a live uh

2485
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,800
presentation this time

2486
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,840
but uh

2487
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,639
the

2488
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,199
virtualized performance or containerized

2489
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,920
performance team uh participated in the

2490
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,280
hackathon

2491
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,480
and they were doing some very

2492
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,960
interesting work on

2493
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,960
express data path and the uh

2494
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,639
the

2495
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,199
berkeley backward packet forwarding that

2496
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,280
um you know the current the current the

2497
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,719
new kernel

2498
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,800
express data path xtp uh makes possible

2499
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,400
so i encourage you to take a look at

2500
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,480
that and i'm gonna follow up with them

2501
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,520
to uh

2502
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,000
uh basically to try to get them to share

2503
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,840
some stuff on our mailing list so we can

2504
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,520
show uh as we can see the advancement of

2505
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,080
this work

2506
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,320
and everybody should

2507
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,920
take a look at that if you have interest

2508
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,199
in this

2509
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,760
containerized infrastructures oh yeah

2510
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,760
also at

2511
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,679
same kind since we're on the topic of

2512
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,800
virtualized benchmarking same comment to

2513
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,920
you uh it's test 009

2514
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:47,360
uh not testers or seven

2515
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,600
you know it's basically the same

2516
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,239
same draft that has the real material

2517
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:54,880
that you want to reference in the um

2518
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,159
uh srv6 draft okay

2519
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,920
so that's good

2520
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,239
all right any other business before we

2521
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:05,839
close up here this afternoon

2522
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,040
all right

2523
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,679
well um

2524
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,880
uh thanks for a really good meeting

i think that uh

2526
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,320
we've heard from

2527
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,600
a lot of draft center development here

2528
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,440
and we've heard from uh

2529
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,440
a lot of drafts that are uh nearing the

2530
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,719
end of the road

2531
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:30,639
and drafts that are

2532
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,480
successfully joining the

2533
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,920
uh the working group as as part of our

2534
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,280
ongoing work

2535
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,040
