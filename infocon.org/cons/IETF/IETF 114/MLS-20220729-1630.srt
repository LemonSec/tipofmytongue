yeah we'll try not to get so close

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
jonathan is that is that better when i'm

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
sitting farther away

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
sounds fun

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,079
no it's templates but whatever

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,239
oh

38
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
that's weird

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,599
that's not what i would have expected

40
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,879
i can fill in

41
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,800
the outline

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,159
you know

43
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,879
as long as i'm not

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
right

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
i'd say that's a pretty good way to

46
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,920
start

47
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,239
all right well let's get started here

48
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,519
um

49
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,040
welcome to the illness working group

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
it's the end of the week hopefully

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,920
everybody's seen all the slides a couple

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
of times

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,239
um

54
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,159
if you didn't mean to be here go back to

55
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
bed or go have lunch or wherever you are

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
in your time zone

57
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
um here's the note well it's the end of

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
the week again you should have seen this

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
this is the uh

60
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
say something if you know something

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
about ipr

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
um you know other policies about you

63
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
know not harassing each other coda conda

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
uh and the like

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
we'd also like to bring up the itf code

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,439
of conduct guidelines

67
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,560
um which are enshrined in rfc 7154 about

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
trading quality with respects

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
um the one that i think they put in for

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
me which is to speak slowly and limit

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
the use of slang

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
dispute ideas with recent argument use

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
best engineering judgment find the best

74
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
solution for the whole the internet

75
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,159
contribute to the ongoing work of the

76
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
itf and uh remind yourself that uh this

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
tool so that we can manage the queue

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
fairly with those that are remote we've

98
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
identified a note taker thank you to our

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
area director

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
we have a jab prescribed this is

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
somebody i assume is in the chat room

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
that will

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
thank you dkg

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,919
we're going to go through some quick

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
status

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
and then basically the agenda is to talk

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
about the drafts that we have and one

108
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
that's up for um consideration the two

109
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
are protocols are the protocol and the

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,639
architecture document

111
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
the federation document extensions and

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
content negotiation

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,360
any agenda bashing

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
all right

115
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
so our status

116
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
we've got our architecture draft which

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
is basically waiting on the chairs to

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
complete the review

119
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,600
to get to the ad technically i'm waiting

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
on all the authors to respond to the

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
questions before i send it to paul

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
and i started that wrangling i think

123
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
yesterday afternoon so it shouldn't take

124
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,919
that long

125
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,479
um the the federation draft we actually

126
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
revived um

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
since the last meeting and the

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
extension's draft is is brand new

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
and this is our little

130
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
for those who don't know how this works

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
this is kind of the winding path that we

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
go through to get to an rfc and we're

133
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
after working group last call i have

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
changed these slides over time so if you

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
remember to look back at the other ones

136
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,759
the the list of drafts 12 through 16

137
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,360
were kind of spread out on the rest of

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
the path um and as usual sometimes you

139
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
do a working group last call and then

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
you you iterate a bunch before you

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,400
actually get out the door so that's

142
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
that's basically what happened um we may

143
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
even have another one before we end up

144
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
sending it paul or before it goes on to

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
the isg because paul will have his

146
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,759
comments and that may result in changes

147
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,520
as well and so we just kind of iterate

148
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,639
through the drafts as we go through the

149
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,840
various processes

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,160
and that is it for the status update um

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
i guess i'd say i didn't make one of

152
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
these for the architecture document

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,919
because

154
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
we they're going to kind of have to go

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,639
together and so the numbers are

156
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
different but it it

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
it got last called and got reviewed what

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
i was really happy with during the

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,919
working group last call for the uh for

160
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
the protocol document was that you know

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,440
when we started this whole process we

162
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
made this kind of like uh promise what

163
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
the security researchers like to take

164
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
their input and they actually provided

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
and put directly back to us to say

166
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
hey we thought it was good so i'm pretty

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,599
happy with that

168
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
all right richard you're up

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,039
all right so i mean this is a super

172
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
quick update on the protocol document

173
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,800
because we had several interims where we

174
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
covered all the interesting stuff and

175
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
now we're kind of in quiet period

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
waiting for the adhd but i thought i'd

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
at least give the folks in a room a

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
brief catch up on what's happened since

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
the last ietf meeting so next slide

180
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
please

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
so since the last ietf we had a working

182
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,560
group last call shortly after the ietf

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
that led to a bunch of good comments got

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
a bunch of good um feedback as a result

185
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
of that last call um had several

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,919
interims

187
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
every couple weeks

188
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
uh thereafter trying to get work through

189
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
those so it took us you know three or

190
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,759
four cycles to get through that but uh

191
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
that led to draft 15

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
which was uh

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,879
last called again

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
and that one went clean

195
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
uh i think there was just a couple minor

196
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
edits i'll talk about in a second uh

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
that was draft 16 and and and here we

198
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
are the f16 we're ready to go to the dad

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
next slide please

200
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,360
so

201
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
just brief update on draft 15.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
this is the changelog i've been doing

203
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
this last few drafts like you can see

204
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
there's there's a bunch of substantive

205
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
stuff here which i got fixed in as a

206
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
result of working group last call

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
i'm not going to go through all of these

208
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,479
i'm just going to go through the first

209
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
one because it's the the biggest one um

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
it's kind of the most substantial one

211
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
next slide at least

212
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,360
one of the things that was noted um as

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
folks were taking a detailed look at the

214
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
algorithms was there are some cases

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
where there are

216
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
ambiguities that had arisen because we

217
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
were suppressing redundant nodes and so

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
you wouldn't always have you know a path

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
that would go all the way to the the

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
root of a tree and things like that

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
so the change that was made to kind of

222
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
simplify and disambiguate a few things

223
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
was to change from using a left balanced

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
binary tree

225
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
to using a balanced binary tree always

226
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
having a full tree so a

227
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
number of leaves it's a power of two

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
so you know

229
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,519
mechanistically what this means is that

230
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,040
when you grow the tree when you when you

231
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
add people to a group and you need to

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
make the tree bigger

233
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
the the way you add

234
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
before the way you add was you would add

235
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
one leaf and you know adjust the tree

236
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,880
structures that it was left balanced

237
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
now instead of adding one leaf you

238
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,720
double the size of the tree and you add

239
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
one leaf and a bunch of blanks um

240
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
so that means you have bigger trees

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
logically speaking

242
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,640
um oh sorry the other mechanistic view

243
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
is when you uh

244
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
when you remove people from the group

245
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
you kind of garbage collect the trees

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
you go before you

247
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
you know as when adding you would remove

248
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
the last leaf and you would remove

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
individual leaves until you got to the

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,040
next uh non-blankly

251
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
with this you know when you remove the

252
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
last person out of that right hand sub

253
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
tree you cut the tree in half you take

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
the left sub tree

255
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
and so on and so you get to

256
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,279
the next non-blank leaf

257
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
so you have this kind of doubling and

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
halving style of

259
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
change to the tree as opposed to one by

260
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,040
one's more continuous uh change

261
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
this makes the tree math a lot simpler

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,920
as it

263
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,480
as a nice consequence

264
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
and especially around the parent hash um

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
a lot of the complexity we had around

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
the parent hash was the need to kind of

267
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
recompute an earlier form of the tree

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,920
structure um at the time the parent hash

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
was computed um

270
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
here we don't change the structure of

271
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,320
the tree you know once you know a node

272
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
is um is in place like structure beneath

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
it doesn't change

274
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
um so we save a lot of complexity there

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
so like i said a moment ago like that

276
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
you end up with a lot of extra blank

277
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,600
nodes

278
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
on the right edge of the tree in some

279
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
cases so

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
as i've shown on the bottom here when

281
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
you add the ninth leaf

282
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
you end up with

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
seven

284
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
extra blank nodes and all their parents

285
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,880
the reason i think books felt

286
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
comfortable this is these nodes are all

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
virtual they're all guaranteed to be

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
blank by the algorithms that we apply

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
here and so you never have to worry

290
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,480
about any content um to the right of the

291
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
rightmost blank leaf

292
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
so you can kind of generate these on the

293
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
fly as you need them and the only time

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,399
you ever need them is when you're

295
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
computing the tree hash of the overall

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
tree

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
and even for that you can kind of

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
pre-compute um the sub-trees you're

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
likely to need the all-blank sub-trees

300
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,560
in certain positions

301
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
so

302
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
even though there's a bunch of uh kind

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
of extra nodes in theory here they don't

304
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
actually end up having much performance

305
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
impact on the protocol

306
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
so

307
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
that's that's the biggest change in

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,800
draft 15.

309
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
and draft 16 um was again after our

310
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
second last call

311
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,399
didn't really get any any substantive

312
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,200
comments here um i think jfio while has

313
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
noticed that there was a

314
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
field missing

315
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,839
in the to be signed version of group

316
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,120
info

317
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
we added that back colin suggested we

318
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
move a reference to normal so for

319
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
informative so it made that change

320
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
that that's the only stuff in the diff

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it was so such a fascinating gif that i

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
forgot to include a change log so

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,839
there'll be a gap in the change log for

324
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,760
that maybe i'll fill it in at 17 if we

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,720
have that

326
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,519
so that yeah we are uh ready to go um so

327
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
paul look for this on your desk as soon

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
as

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,279
sean gets it together

330
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,880
questions or comments

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
yeah so um i think we're going to be

332
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
good the write-up will be done probably

333
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
sometime next week and then i'll pass it

334
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,839
over to you and depending upon your

335
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
vacation schedule for the rest of the

336
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,880
you know the summer we'll we'll get

337
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
through it so i'm hoping

338
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
i'm cautiously optimistic that we can

339
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
start the reviews uh because you'll

340
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
press the button you know before the end

341
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
of august

342
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
and then for those who might not have

343
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
been involved in the itf for a long time

344
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
uh the cycle will kind of continue we'll

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,839
get director reviews from other areas so

346
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,360
they'll start looking at all kinds of

347
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
things that we never even thought about

348
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,079
and we'll have to address those comments

349
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
as we move forward

350
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,320
so um okay so next i believe is benjamin

351
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
i didn't he doesn't have slides but

352
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
that's all right

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
he's here

354
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,839
i don't actually see benjamin in the

355
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
room

356
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
all right well i mean so the nice thing

357
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,560
is the architecture document was kind of

358
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
like it's the one that's going to go

359
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,519
with the protocol document and explains

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
a bunch of things i think

361
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,519
he was really good about keeping them

362
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,560
aligned to make sure things were

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
explained so

364
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
mostly what he said in an email to me

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
was there are some things that we could

366
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
talk about that we could do for the

367
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
future but i think we should get done

368
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
what we're doing now

369
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,399
um before moving on to the next thing

370
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
because that often causes problems so

371
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
all right well that then we'll move over

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
to raphael

373
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
and i see him there all right

374
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,839
all right

375
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,040
hey everyone

376
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
so i think sean already studied the

377
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
allocation of the time slots have been

378
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,959
relatively generous i don't think we're

379
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,000
going to need that much time

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
so especially since last time we already

381
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
touched on the federation document so

382
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
this is actually just a brief overview

383
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,720
again

384
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
for those who didn't attend last time

385
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
so um

386
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
the federation document has been there

387
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
for a while it's been updated now and

388
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
then we also want to talk about brand

389
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
new document like sean said

390
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
the extensions document

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,120
next slide please

392
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,880
so the federation document

393
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
[Music]

394
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
hadn't seen any updates in a while and

395
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,639
so now the scope is is more clear than

396
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,320
in the beginning so this is clearly a

397
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
non-normative document

398
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
conceptually more like the architecture

399
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,800
document but with a narrower scope

400
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,160
focusing

401
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,120
on

402
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
interrupt and federation and outlining

403
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,760
different deployment scenarios

404
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,560
giving some high-level guidelines

405
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
on how applications

406
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,519
could structure things

407
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,839
whether it's different servers that

408
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,079
interoperate or

409
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,800
clients from different vendors

410
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,279
that all talk to the same server

411
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
and there are few security

412
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
considerations as well

413
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
um

414
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
so an end was adapted to the

415
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,160
the newer versions of the protocol draft

416
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
so since it's not normative it's it's

417
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,800
not prescriptive in the way of how

418
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
federation should be done with mls it's

419
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
really just there to give an overview

420
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
um it doesn't give

421
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
any any wire format for

422
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
messages in a federated context or

423
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
anything like that so we think there was

424
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
a consensus that we said that

425
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
the charter of this working group

426
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
shouldn't accommodate for that

427
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
so in a way it's a bit of a placeholder

428
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
in the sense that it would be nice going

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
forward to have normative documents that

430
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
describe all of these

431
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,279
different aspects of federation

432
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,040
and that might very well be the case

433
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,900
going forward for example with the um

434
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,320
[Music]

435
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,839
soon to be hopefully mimi working group

436
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
and once that is there and and the

437
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
scopes are aligned then potentially this

438
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
document could actually reference

439
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,920
specific normative documents there

440
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
yeah that was federation next slide

441
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,320
thank you so yeah over the just to zoom

442
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
out a bit over the past few years we've

443
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,199
um

444
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,279
really tried to make mls work for

445
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,839
different kinds of deployment types

446
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,079
different applications etc so

447
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
the outcome of that is that the mls

448
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,639
protocol is relatively versatile

449
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,920
just to give an example there are

450
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
several ways of how

451
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
members can be added to a group

452
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
and depending on how the application

453
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,520
works specifically

454
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,679
but at some point we also had to draw

455
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
the line when it comes to things that

456
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,559
are too specific and not general enough

457
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,679
um so the idea here was

458
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
to outsource that into an extensions

459
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,599
document

460
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,880
um

461
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,839
so

462
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
we specifically started with the app act

463
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,400
mechanism that used to be in the mls

464
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,840
protocol document

465
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
and that

466
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
is now the first extension in the mls

467
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
extensions document

468
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
there is a pr something that

469
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
we discussed in the past and there are a

470
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
few applications that were interested in

471
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,480
it

472
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
and that is targeted messages um so

473
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
that's not in the document yet and it's

474
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,919
going to need

475
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
some more review

476
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
but it's a start

477
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
i see ron you put your hand up

478
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,520
go ahead

479
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
do you want to say anything wrong

480
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
yeah yeah it just took a really long

481
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,919
time for my my mute button to turn off

482
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,039
um

483
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
so thanks thanks for for

484
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,120
writing this up raphael um

485
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
i um

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
my my only question here is whether we

487
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
want to have

488
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
um individual

489
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,160
doc like small documents where we have

490
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,520
an mls app back document and an mls

491
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,919
targeted messages document

492
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,720
um

493
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
my intuition is that having a handful of

494
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
small ones is better than having one

495
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
sort of you know one catch-all because

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
the maturity of in the individual

497
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,520
extensions

498
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
may be very different and the security

499
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
considerations would be easier to

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
understand

501
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
if they are

502
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
individual so that's just a preference i

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
don't have a huge you know strong

504
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
feeling but just something i wanted to

505
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
bring up

506
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
yeah that's definitely a good point and

507
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,679
i think we discussed it in the past as

508
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,520
well um

509
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
so

510
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
i guess for now the the consensus is

511
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,400
that we should have this one document

512
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
especially since what we are concretely

513
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
discussing is relatively small

514
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,840
uh

515
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,080
what wouldn't work for example is if we

516
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
had extensions that are very complex and

517
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,919
that would mandate a very long

518
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,440
description

519
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,000
etc so that that would be uh that would

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
put too much strain on the extensions

521
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
document and in that case

522
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
it would probably have to be a separate

523
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
document but the idea was to see if we

524
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,559
can

525
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,600
um

526
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
collect some of these low-hanging fruits

527
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
essentially that's

528
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
in the case of the apec mechanism that

529
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
didn't make it into the protocol and

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
that's relatively short and the same

531
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
goes for targeted messages

532
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
but it's not prohibitive i think

533
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
in the sense that you could always have

534
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,679
an extra document for something much

535
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,400
more specific

536
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,679
richard

537
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
yeah i was just gonna um

538
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
basically post whatever rafael said um i

539
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,039
i looked into the kind of

540
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
precedent for this in the ietf stream

541
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
that the apps comparison here that i

542
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
found was rfc 6066 which i linked in the

543
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
chat

544
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,919
which is a bucket of small

545
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
extensions to tls that was published

546
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,280
shortly after

547
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
tls 1.2

548
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
so it seems like that there's precedent

549
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,799
for

550
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,679
either

551
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,880
approach here

552
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
um i think raphael's

553
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,840
spot on uh that if these are small

554
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
things that aren't sort of big enough

555
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
and complex enough to merit their own uh

556
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,039
documents then it's fine to just make a

557
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
document that this has several of them

558
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
together

559
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
and i'll note that 6066 is highlight has

560
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,520
such uh important things as things like

561
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
uh server name indication

562
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
um and uh

563
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
the uh

564
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,520
cert is ocsp stapling extension as well

565
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
so there's there's some widely used

566
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,679
extensions that uh went in there

567
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,559
but

568
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,000
still were simply enough it's like a

569
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
multi-extension document

570
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,960
yeah thanks richard a very good point

571
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
yeah so i mean on that on that point run

572
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,280
i think basically if uh if somebody's

573
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
really hard over on wanting to make sure

574
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
there's like a generic extensions

575
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
document and then little ones and and

576
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,919
littler ones for the actual extensions

577
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
themselves and they can get to the

578
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
microphone but i think this is a

579
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
editorial kind of thing

580
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
and i think the

581
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
maybe the isg will will get it'll get

582
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
through easier because there's an actual

583
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,200
extension in the extension document from

584
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
the chew on um i can imagine some you

585
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
know that we sent a blank extension

586
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
document forward to them and they'd be

587
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,400
like what are you going to use it for if

588
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,440
you don't need it while you're wasting

589
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,799
our time so

590
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,000
i don't know i can kind of see it both

591
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
ways so unless somebody really has a

592
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
strong opinion about this we're just

593
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,640
going to launch forward

594
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
all right so yeah that's pretty much the

595
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
the status quo for extensions i'm

596
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
curious to see

597
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
if folks have comments on it going

598
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
forward in a way this might also be the

599
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
escape patch for things

600
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
that we didn't think about in the

601
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
context of the protocol but that we now

602
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,799
discover as we implement mls into

603
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,320
existing systems

604
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
can i see a show of hands for people who

605
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
have read the draft in the room

606
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,559
let me

607
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
get rid of it all right so there there

608
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,559
was nobody raised there or one thank you

609
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
mallory um that have read it so we'll

610
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,919
have to we'll have to beat the drum

611
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,039
granted it's a new draft so maybe that's

612
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,600
understandable

613
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
and unless there's anything else i think

614
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,280
we're gonna hand it over to ron

615
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,320
okay thanks raphael

616
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,720
okay um

617
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
i did a document on content negotiation

618
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,200
um

619
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
anybody has anybody read this this

620
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
document

621
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,480
uh not seen any hands other than mine

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
okay i saw raphael's and sean's all

623
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,799
right um next slide please

624
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,080
okay so the problem that i

625
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
wanted to solve is

626
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
our

627
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
two problems

628
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,240
so right now there's no way to find out

629
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
which application formats are supported

630
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
and which application formats are

631
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
required in a particular group

632
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,600
and then

633
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
there

634
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
also is no way in mls to signal

635
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
well what is the what's the format of

636
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
application data because it's completely

637
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,080
opaque

638
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
um

639
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
this that

640
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
attribute

641
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,480
makes it really difficult for example to

642
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
if you have a long-lived group

643
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
like uh in an instant messaging context

644
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,760
you could easily imagine a group that

645
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,400
has been around for you know two three

646
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
five years

647
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,039
um

648
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,840
switching content formats because you

649
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
upgraded some software because you added

650
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
a new feature that's really difficult if

651
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
you don't have some kind of content

652
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
negotiation mechanism

653
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,000
and

654
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
interoperability is also challenging if

655
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,320
you had

656
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
initially one heterogeneous set of

657
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,520
clients

658
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
and then you want to do interoperability

659
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
with another

660
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,520
another client it's nice if you can have

661
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
a way to say oh here's my proprietary

662
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,880
format or here's the standards-based

663
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
format

664
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
and that you you can negotiate among

665
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
them

666
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,880
next slide please

667
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
so um i wrote up another

668
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
two mls

669
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,080
mls extensions as a proposal

670
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,840
one is a list of accepted media types

671
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,880
which would be in a key package

672
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,799
so if you when you publish key package

673
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,400
you can list this

674
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,360
and

675
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
you can just go nuts and lists a bunch

676
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,799
of different media types that you

677
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,080
support uh for your particular client

678
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,799
uh and then in the group context then

679
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
there's a separate um

680
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,840
a separate extension required media

681
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,559
types and so if

682
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,480
if the creator of a group wanted to say

683
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
all members in this group need to

684
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
support this

685
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
um this media type or this list of media

686
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
types they could express that with the

687
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,039
required media types extension

688
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,919
um so what is a media type um

689
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
there is uh you know

690
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
if you're using http you're using them

691
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,919
every day there's an extensive i am a

692
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
media types registry

693
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you know you probably have seen uh you

694
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,120
know

695
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
image jpeg text plain

696
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159
text markdown um

697
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,000
but there are

698
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
um

699
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
there's an extensive list that already

700
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,240
exists

701
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
um you can define new ones

702
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,559
um via um

703
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
via i think specification

704
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
by providing a specification you can get

705
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,919
a new registration

706
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,840
and then there's also a vendor space

707
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,279
that you can use

708
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
if you don't want to bother doing a

709
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
registration but just want to register

710
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
something like

711
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,440
uh you know vnd for vendor.examplecorp

712
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
plus whatever format type you want to

713
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
call your thing

714
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,840
you can just start using that you don't

715
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,439
need anyone's permission to do that

716
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,600
next slide please

717
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
okay so in terms of

718
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
the format of

719
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
a uh

720
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
of an mls of the application data in an

721
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,799
mls message

722
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,720
um

723
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,200
the this extension

724
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
says

725
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,039
okay if there is a required media types

726
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,720
in the group context

727
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
then that implies that you want to

728
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,919
you want to use

729
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,480
this additional little very lightweight

730
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,799
application framing which uses

731
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,679
uh the tls presentation language

732
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,399
so

733
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,918
there's the struct right here

734
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,919
there is

735
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
a single media type and then there is

736
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
the rest of your application content

737
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,080
and the media type itself it could be a

738
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,760
zero length vector

739
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,159
uh and if you put a zeroing vector there

740
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,520
then the

741
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
you know this proposal says

742
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,559
uh assume the first media type listed in

743
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
the required media types list

744
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,679
so uh if you wanted to use this

745
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,200
application framing

746
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
uh the amount of extra overhead is very

747
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
small uh it would be between

748
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,880
uh three and four bytes if you

749
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
uh if you think you're always going to

750
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
be sending the same media type

751
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,640
and if you want to be able to do

752
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
something in the future and use a

753
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,640
different media type then

754
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
you can still do that and there's no

755
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
confusion about what the format is of

756
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
the application data

757
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,559
ted

758
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,440
howdy uh i actually put my my hand up

759
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
when we were still talking about the

760
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,679
ayanna registry aspect of it and

761
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
i'm going to suggest that you may want

762
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
to think about how you interact with the

763
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
registry a little more in depth because

764
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,039
in addition to having some

765
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,399
top-level types which are almost

766
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,399
certainly going to be

767
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,720
very difficult to to imagine use here

768
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,000
like model

769
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
um there there are also a whole bunch of

770
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,039
media types uh where the interesting

771
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
bits actually start occurring in the

772
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
parameters rather than in the media type

773
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
itself

774
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
uh so when you're looking at the media

775
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,520
type here

776
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
you may want to think about whether you

777
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,919
want to break it down into media type

778
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
and parameters

779
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,000
and

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,360
carry those separately in the

781
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,000
application content here so that people

782
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,279
can actually do

783
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,440
um the kind of

784
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
content negotiation applications that

785
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,679
you actually see in

786
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,000
in in other protocols and and i will

787
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,720
tell you that having uh led one of those

788
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
content negotiation working groups

789
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,159
through to its fiery death connect

790
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,039
um

791
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
that uh there are a whole bunch of these

792
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
things that that people do add as bells

793
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
and whistles that don't get used but

794
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
then there are also some uh aspects of

795
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,840
it that you really do need that go

796
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,159
beyond just the media type itself

797
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,640
so i would suggest making this a little

798
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
bit more complic complex in the

799
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,679
structure

800
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
to allow for required parameters uh and

801
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,440
also to limit the number of media types

802
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
you're actually willing uh top level

803
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
media types uh you're willing to deal

804
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
with uh just because otherwise you're

805
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,159
you're probably going to give yourself a

806
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,480
little bit of pain

807
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,799
okay so if if i'm understanding you

808
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,919
correctly

809
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
in uh you can

810
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,679
see in

811
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
required media types

812
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,840
wanting to

813
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
specify uh parameters in required media

814
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,559
types

815
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,360
um

816
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,399
that may be a subset of what you would

817
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
put in the media type in the application

818
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,600
framing

819
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,640
yeah so imagine that you you have um

820
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
here i'm going to pick something out of

821
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
the registry um

822
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
yeah so that

823
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,200
car said one of the most complex

824
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
possible uh examples but

825
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,679
a good example uh despite that um

826
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,039
you will find that there are there are

827
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,720
going to be cases where you're like look

828
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
i don't really speak anything but utf-8

829
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,279
and so it's required that you if you're

830
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,519
going to specify a car set to

831
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,519
to your textual one that it's gonna be

832
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,760
uh utf-8 because if you send me some

833
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,279
weird old

834
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,919
japanese one from the the 70s i'm just

835
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
going to work all over you anyway so you

836
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,919
might as well give up now

837
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,600
so i think you need a little bit more

838
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,880
complexity in this struct to handle

839
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,120
permitted or or required parameters and

840
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
i think you seriously want to take a

841
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
look at the top level types and say

842
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
yeah i probably don't ever want to send

843
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,799
model or font

844
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,519
as a top level type

845
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
you want to think about it maybe you do

846
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,720
but i kind of doubt it

847
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,559
daniel khan gilmore uh most of what i

848
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
wanted to say ted has already said so uh

849
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,679
one plus one those comments uh i wanted

850
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,760
to also flag that in your example you

851
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,279
had mentioned a multi-part alternative

852
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,840
which seems to imply uh like a mime

853
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,240
framing but i don't see mime in the rest

854
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,519
of this

855
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,720
um

856
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
and so i just wanted to you know

857
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
maybe i'll add that to the add

858
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
multi-part to the list of uh scary

859
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,120
things

860
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,679
scary top levels that you might want to

861
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,679
consider ruling out here if you want

862
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,600
this to be simple

863
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
okay so before you know i deal with

864
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
email and there's a lot of multi-part

865
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,840
there and it you know multi-part is is

866
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,880
basically

867
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,480
flexible enough to destroy you um

868
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
or to destroy itself if you get it wrong

869
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
so

870
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,919
uh yeah there's just there's a lot of

871
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,760
dragons there that i'm not sure you want

872
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
to

873
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,799
easily claim uh support for

874
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,799
so before you sit down i just want to

875
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,159
say that

876
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,159
the inclusion of multi-part alternative

877
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,760
was intentional

878
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
because

879
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
i think we want the semantics of

880
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,360
multi-part alternative and if somebody

881
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,640
wants to propose some alternate syntax

882
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,760
that doesn't use my boundaries

883
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,399
then that would be that would be welcome

884
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,559
and i also

885
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,720
can imagine a number of multi-part types

886
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,559
that i really really like multi-part

887
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,080
report is going to be completely

888
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
irrelevant i think

889
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,640
um that we will never ever want to use

890
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
yeah so i mean

891
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,159
there are a lot of libraries that are

892
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,320
out there for dealing with mime and i'm

893
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,760
not saying you shouldn't use mine if

894
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,799
you're going to do a multi-part

895
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,399
alternative semantic

896
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,520
um

897
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,320
[Music]

898
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,919
i'm just aware

899
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,919
as someone who tends to prefer to read

900
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,000
the text plain parts of multi-part

901
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,360
alternatives

902
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,640
that

903
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,120
the intent of multi-part alternative is

904
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
not often honored by the sender

905
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
and in fact the sender often doesn't

906
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,200
know that they're using it

907
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
and i regularly get mail that doesn't

908
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,799
make any sense and then i switch to the

909
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,919
text to the text html part and i learn

910
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
that the content is entirely different

911
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
and the majority of the semantics for

912
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,039
what what as far as i can tell the

913
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,600
vendors that are flaunting their use of

914
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,560
multi-part uh alternative these days is

915
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,199
we know how to stuff a tricky thing into

916
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,159
the email summary that you see in your

917
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,440
inbox

918
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
because that's what the text plain part

919
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
gets used for

920
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
in some in some male user agents and

921
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,040
that doesn't have anything to do with

922
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
the content of the message so i'm just

923
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
i'm just observing that multi-part

924
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,639
alternative and and some of the other

925
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,000
pieces can be

926
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,960
can be very um

927
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,839
subtly abused

928
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,560
uh yeah and then related and then even

929
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,960
when you have a multi-part

930
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,480
alternative and then you have multi-part

931
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
related and you have html that has

932
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
images

933
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,199
do they get attached to the related or

934
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,719
are they subpart i mean it's there's

935
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,239
i don't think we know how to do it in

936
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,359
email and we've been trying to do it for

937
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,719
40 years

938
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,000
um

939
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,119
30 30 years at least in email and and

940
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,160
so importing that into mls might or

941
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,440
might not be

942
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,560
what you actually want to do

943
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,400
speaking as an individual

944
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
i'm a little worried about the part

945
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
where you say

946
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,599
if the media type is empty

947
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
the first media type is assumed because

948
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,520
this is a typical thing where there's a

949
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,599
list of 10 media types and 10 years down

950
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,280
the line nobody uses the first entry

951
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
anymore everybody switched to the fifth

952
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
one and now there's a bug in some 10

953
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
year old code and now you can send a

954
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,359
malicious a message that triggers you

955
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,440
you to use that gold path that you

956
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,320
haven't used for 10 years

957
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,000
is there a way to make this like a

958
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
mandatory field that is just always

959
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,320
clear

960
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,000
well um

961
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
so i'll point out that

962
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,599
the

963
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,599
so if people don't you know this is a

964
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,839
proposal so if people don't ever want to

965
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,720
have

966
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,880
a sort of an abbreviated way and always

967
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,200
want to send a media type then we can

968
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,359
just remove the first media type is

969
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,720
assumed

970
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
and so that's one discussion

971
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,079
separately

972
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
this issue of having a group that has

973
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,320
the first media type live around forever

974
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
even after nobody wants it anymore

975
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,400
that mls has a group um let's see it's

976
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,760
called the group

977
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,240
context extension or something like that

978
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,480
there there's a proposal type that you

979
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,160
can send to the group

980
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,560
that updates your group extensions

981
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,480
so that everybody agrees that these are

982
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,800
the new extensions and so that would be

983
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
an easy way to update

984
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,560
the required media types extension to

985
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
have a different list

986
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,520
and all you would require is that all of

987
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
the all of the members at that moment in

988
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
that epic

989
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
had support for

990
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,200
the for the media types that were in the

991
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
required media types list then the new

992
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
list

993
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
okay that makes me slightly less worried

994
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,040
but still worried

995
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,279
ted

996
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,880
um

997
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,560
so i wanted to

998
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,800
to kind of go back to

999
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
um a bigger principle here because as i

1000
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,520
was thinking uh when daniel kahn gilmore

1001
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,200
was talking about

1002
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,040
multi-part i was thinking oh yeah and

1003
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
multilingual don't get me started right

1004
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,599
um uh because there's a whole bunch of

1005
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,599
stuff where in in order to get the

1006
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,839
multilingual stuff to look even vaguely

1007
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,000
um realistic you have to know

1008
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
a whole bunch more than you could

1009
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
possibly get into this into this

1010
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,079
structure and frankly a whole bunch more

1011
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,240
even than the mime parameters typically

1012
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,280
tell you

1013
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,240
um so what i would suggest here is that

1014
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,640
you actually consider

1015
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
um instead of

1016
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,160
making this people can send anything

1017
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,200
um

1018
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,359
that you actually consider

1019
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,680
starting out with this being

1020
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,160
an mls registry of mime types that are

1021
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,280
permitted

1022
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,839
and you can decide whenever you get the

1023
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,160
registry expert

1024
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
assigned what level that needs to be

1025
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
right whether it's like all of image is

1026
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
okay and people can send

1027
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,880
um whatever proposal for the image type

1028
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,760
that that's that's cool or they can send

1029
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,040
anything for text and that's cool and

1030
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,119
if somebody tells you that they want to

1031
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,560
to add

1032
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
you know font or

1033
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
um model or

1034
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
multi-part you you go down and say okay

1035
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
we're going to say these are

1036
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,119
these are now described in a way

1037
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,640
that

1038
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,359
these are um comprehensible and we can

1039
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,160
say yes right then this is okay so you

1040
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,240
might end up saying multi-part report is

1041
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,960
the multi-part that's um

1042
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
uh accepted into the registry where

1043
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,680
image slash is just to that level of

1044
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,359
differentiation

1045
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
because i have a strong suspicion

1046
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,040
um that uh

1047
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,520
over time you would develop the muscle

1048
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
that would say you this this is an easy

1049
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,400
job for the um

1050
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,920
for for the the registry expert

1051
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,480
four years five years in but the first

1052
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,560
few going through people really are

1053
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
gonna have to have

1054
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
you know somebody like murray who's done

1055
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,599
with media type registration for a long

1056
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,240
time to sit down with them and say

1057
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,560
have you thought about x you know and do

1058
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,119
you understand what it's going to mean

1059
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,920
when

1060
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
um you you do something that's like a

1061
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,760
binary type which doesn't convey any

1062
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,200
actual semantics or something like mp4

1063
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
where it's all actually inside the

1064
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
container and the media type doesn't

1065
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,720
tell you anything

1066
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
you know have you thought about what

1067
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,839
that's going to mean

1068
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,960
and i think

1069
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,839
maybe making this

1070
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,359
draw it from a registry where you have a

1071
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,000
registry expert and move toward a more

1072
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,319
open and open registry policy

1073
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,640
over time may be a better route to

1074
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
success

1075
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,839
because really opening it up from the

1076
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,200
beginning

1077
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,079
i think you're going to lose

1078
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,960
interoperability really really fast

1079
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
especially with the vendor types

1080
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,640
and that's going to be a shame

1081
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,319
okay um so one thing i wanted to clarify

1082
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,040
ted i think you meant probably like a

1083
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,400
mimi

1084
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,800
uh specific registry because

1085
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,599
like for mls like i could i could use

1086
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,640
mls to distribute fonts among my laser

1087
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,760
printers

1088
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,359
and i could have an mls group that i

1089
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,200
used to exchange those fonts and i could

1090
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,119
use the font type

1091
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,720
and that would be like up to me to

1092
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,640
figure out how to make that work nicely

1093
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
but for instant messaging like i would

1094
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,599
want

1095
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
a profile that says i only want to use

1096
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
these types and with these parameters

1097
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,760
and under these conditions

1098
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,119
that's absolutely correct and my

1099
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,200
apologies for being less than precise

1100
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,160
there

1101
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
no worries

1102
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
okay

1103
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
let's uh let's move on to the next slide

1104
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,760
please

1105
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,359
so

1106
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,759
um

1107
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
all right so we had a lot of discussion

1108
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,720
about the content negotiation part of

1109
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,599
this

1110
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,440
but um

1111
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,680
if we want to use an mls

1112
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,119
extension

1113
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,359
in order to signal any of this

1114
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,560
then

1115
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,720
some of this work needs probably needs

1116
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,839
to happen in the mls working

1117
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,800
group um and so then a question is do we

1118
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
want to do this work

1119
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,599
do we want this work to go into the

1120
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,599
generic extension you know do we want

1121
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,200
the extension part

1122
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
to go into a generic

1123
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,440
extensions document do we want a

1124
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
separate document

1125
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,000
um

1126
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,319
you know is this a reasonable start to

1127
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,000
that problem if we want to do that

1128
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,119
problem so the number of questions here

1129
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,640
um so i would like to

1130
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,480
oh yeah and i just wanted to say like

1131
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,720
um

1132
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
that

1133
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,839
please please

1134
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:14,960
if you

1135
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,640
if you've got something that you want to

1136
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
say about oh you know i don't like this

1137
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,599
or i like that or whatever please try to

1138
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
focus on the semantics first because i

1139
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,880
really don't care very much about the

1140
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,720
syntax of this document

1141
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,520
um

1142
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,359
i want to get the semantics right and

1143
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,880
most of the comments of the mic have all

1144
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
been about semantics so i'm quite

1145
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,920
pleased about that

1146
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
uh

1147
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,079
so maybe i will pass it over to

1148
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,160
to uh to sean to

1149
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,280
talk about the

1150
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,880
right so um

1151
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,240
the reason why this obviously isn't in

1152
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,440
the extensions draft is because it's

1153
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
kind of a little different than some of

1154
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
the other things um the first thing is

1155
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
actually a question that we have to ask

1156
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
our area director is because this will

1157
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,200
be the first thing that is about

1158
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,800
enabling interoperability among the

1159
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,880
applications where specifically the

1160
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,960
charter says we won't do that now we

1161
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
didn't do it in the base protocol we're

1162
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,560
gonna do an extension so if you look at

1163
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
it all right i think it probably could

1164
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,680
fit

1165
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,440
but this would be a question because it

1166
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,960
specifically said it is not a goal of

1167
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,200
this group to enable interoperability

1168
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,480
federation between messaging

1169
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,599
applications beyond the key

1170
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,880
establishment authentication and

1171
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
confidentiality services so we're but i

1172
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,800
would look at that as kind of like in

1173
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,560
the base protocol this is an extension

1174
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,319
so i kind of see like i could fit and we

1175
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,440
won't have to like change the cart

1176
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,119
charter or whatever to like call it

1177
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,800
extensions but it would be the first

1178
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,440
thing so and um you'll know that the

1179
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,200
discussion that we had for 20 minutes

1180
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
about media types is one of the reasons

1181
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,240
why this working group didn't want to do

1182
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,160
any of that because it's all a

1183
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,839
specialized expertise area that not a

1184
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,480
lot of us have so i guess really the

1185
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,240
question is are there people that are

1186
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,200
interested

1187
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
in kind of doing this because rowan's

1188
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,160
definitely you know been talking about

1189
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,480
this for a while

1190
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
so i'll bring up an analogy that came up

1191
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,880
when we discussed this a bit earlier

1192
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,760
which is to tls and alpn

1193
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
um on the one hand that seems to me to

1194
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,400
argue that like doing this in the mls

1195
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,760
working group should be pretty fun we

1196
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
might need to tweak the charter language

1197
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,480
that sean mentioned but you know if if

1198
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,240
tls could do a lpm which talks about the

1199
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,440
things happening in the next clear up

1200
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
this seems

1201
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,319
analogous

1202
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,760
um

1203
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,280
that kind of

1204
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,040
makes me wonder if this might be a

1205
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
little simpler if it were a little bit

1206
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
more like uh alpn in terms of

1207
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,319
abstraction

1208
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,240
um so you could have

1209
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,079
say a generic protocol identifier that

1210
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,200
could say

1211
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,560
um

1212
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,599
you know

1213
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,880
how what what goes on inside the uh the

1214
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
payload so you know you have a syntax

1215
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,240
here for what goes inside the message

1216
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,440
payloads

1217
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,880
maybe a different app wants to do it

1218
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,040
differently or something like that

1219
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
i i'm not sure that's that's worth the

1220
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,520
extra indirection but it is an approach

1221
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,280
out there i think generally in terms of

1222
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,560
where this this lives um

1223
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,800
it kind of comes down on to how much of

1224
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
the complexity that was just discussed

1225
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,240
we're gonna have to take on here if this

1226
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,000
is at the layer of this kind of string

1227
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,400
comparison um i think it's probably

1228
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,480
compact enough to take on here and take

1229
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,400
on in the just let's put in the

1230
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,160
extensions document

1231
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,839
um if it's gonna have to go into a whole

1232
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,880
bunch of mime details that might

1233
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,480
belong a little higher up the stack

1234
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,079
so

1235
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,400
i think that we didn't can i see a show

1236
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,000
of hands of people who have read this in

1237
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,560
their working group

1238
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
maybe i could do a poll

1239
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,520
i haven't done that this week

1240
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,880
let's see if i can do that is that a

1241
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,800
poll it's a gal review where's the

1242
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
note-taking tool

1243
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
show of hands tool

1244
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
let's do that

1245
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,680
while you're firing that i'm just going

1246
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,599
to repeat something it's a comment ted

1247
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,160
made in the chat that um the the mls a

1248
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,319
lpn sort of thing i was meaning would be

1249
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,000
like to have an extension an mls that

1250
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
says this is me me uh and then you know

1251
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
whatever content negotiation you did

1252
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,480
would be the specifics of the content

1253
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,240
negotiation would be specific to the

1254
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,480
mini protocol

1255
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
yeah so if you've read it i'm starting a

1256
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
poll just raise your hand if you read it

1257
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,800
i mean

1258
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
we got you know

1259
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
out of 10 people we got five that's

1260
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,319
pretty good actually

1261
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,759
um all right so

1262
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,160
are there any objections

1263
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,400
to adopting this draft obviously

1264
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
assuming that paul says yes it's good

1265
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,040
and we won't we're not going to get

1266
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,119
slapped down because of the charter um

1267
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,319
are there any objections to it

1268
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
raphael

1269
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,560
yeah i think the the point you brought

1270
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,240
up so it's not not an objection per se

1271
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,640
but the point you just production is um

1272
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,480
it's quite important because

1273
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,760
the nature of the discussion we're

1274
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,359
having now

1275
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,400
um

1276
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
it's fundamentally different from the

1277
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,920
discussions we've had in the past around

1278
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,960
mls

1279
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,880
and and you you bring up a good point

1280
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,839
where

1281
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,720
um

1282
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,319
the question is really whether the

1283
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,240
expertise that is required for these

1284
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,480
kind of discussions um

1285
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
you know is within the mls working group

1286
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,359
at this point

1287
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,359
so obviously there are some experts we

1288
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,920
saw that in the past 20 minutes but um

1289
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,760
i'm wondering if from a technical

1290
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,560
perspective it wouldn't be even better

1291
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,400
um

1292
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,800
if if that was done

1293
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,720
somewhere else like i think in in the

1294
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,079
comment section

1295
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
it's just from from uh ted

1296
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,559
question

1297
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,040
whether this couldn't uh punt the whole

1298
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,240
thing to

1299
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,480
for example the mimi

1300
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,040
working group to be something like that

1301
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,839
i mean that that is an open question

1302
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:46,640
right

1303
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,119
um and there's also some questions for

1304
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,920
me

1305
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,040
yeah there's i mean there's also been

1306
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,640
precedent where a working group took it

1307
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,319
and then if mimi like we start it and

1308
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,160
then if mimi takes off

1309
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,760
we can give it to them right like at the

1310
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,880
end of the day i think rohan doesn't

1311
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,440
really care just wants to get it done

1312
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,280
but

1313
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,040
yeah so pablo

1314
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,480
so the important thing i think is that

1315
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,000
that any of these discussions don't

1316
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,680
delay the core documents that we get

1317
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,400
those things out first um then we can we

1318
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,839
have some time to find out what's the

1319
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
best space for this document to go to

1320
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,200
okay

1321
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,960
um so rohan i know you were looking for

1322
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,559
a working group call for adoption but i

1323
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,839
think we're gonna we're gonna we're

1324
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,119
gonna wait a little bit and try to beat

1325
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,040
the drum to get people going and yeah i

1326
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
mean so the great part is you're

1327
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,920
actually leading the effort for mimi as

1328
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,160
well so you know if we get that kicked

1329
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,319
off and going maybe it's the first maybe

1330
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,760
what's the thing they do or we do it

1331
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,520
here because it it is kind of simple but

1332
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,160
it is kind of thorny

1333
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,040
um

1334
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,960
it's all right and that brings us to the

1335
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,359
end of our agenda does anyone else have

1336
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,839
anything to add

1337
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,680
all right well thank you very much and

1338
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,879
safe travel homes everyone

1339
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
thanks

1340
