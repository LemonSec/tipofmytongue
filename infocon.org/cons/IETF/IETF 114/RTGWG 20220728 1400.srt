if the destination starts routing

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
we've got great research topic on

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
framework for evaluation of performance

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
of routing protocols really interesting

111
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
work and actually

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,759

assume you should have the slide control

126
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,520
now

127
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,080
please go ahead

128
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
i see

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
hello hi zim

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,440

137
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,319

so i guess we'll do the second

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
presentation then i assume maybe you can

141
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,080
figure out

142
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,640

good morning

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,040
okay so this is network to cloud and

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,080
this strap has been unfold for a while

146
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
in the rtg working group and there are

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,000
quite a few work

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,880
recently in ietf so many people told me

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
should

150
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
finish this so that's why i'm coming

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
back next page please

152
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
so there um we haven't been here for a

153
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
while so

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
we added a co-author from azure

155
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,360
microsoft and he brought in a lot more

156
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
problems and so we

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
try to focus the problems to the routing

158
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
area the the problems which can be

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
addressed by the routing area there are

160
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
many many problems in

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
in connecting to the cloud so we're not

162
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
being be able to solve all of them many

163
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
of them are gravity problems just not

164
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
being able to solve by us

165
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
so we also revise the

166
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
gap analysis accordingly

167
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,120
so here on this next slide please

168
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,640
sorry

169
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240

171
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
okay um so um

172
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
well the big problem um in cloud data

173
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
center is

174
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
the workload in the cloud data center

175
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,000
are connected to many many peers many

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
parties so one of the problems uh

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
experience is the pgp

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,959
mismatch

179
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
configuration arrows

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,839
you have parties in different places um

181
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
like configuring the

182
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,720
the

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
bgp

184
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
capability there's a mismatch and

185
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
there's also notification issues and

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
causing one party to drop

187
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
if you have the workload in the cloud

188
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
and in the

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
on-prem you want to create a vpn you

190
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
want to do the bgp connection um like

191
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
how do you

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
create the bgp

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,720
consistent configuration on both sides

194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
like bgp over

195
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
ipsa configuration that's the issue they

196
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
cannot be able to do it

197
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
very consistently

198
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,120
that's one problem next slide please

199
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,680
second um issue is

200
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
when the cloud gate gateway data center

201
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
is connecting to many sites um or pods

202
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
um pods go um sometimes go um aggregate

203
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
degradation or go dark actually it's not

204
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,279
uncommon

205
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,440
that there's fiber cut or there's a

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
power outage or there's overload and

207
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
causing one side to go dark and with

208
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,519
that when that happens

209
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,399
large number of routes will be need to

210
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
be switched by the ingress router so

211
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
with today's

212
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
sending

213
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
route withdrawal message

214
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
there'll be large number of

215
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,320
messages um so they will need a way to

216
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
be able to

217
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
notify to the ingress router of a large

218
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,839
number of routes um being

219
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
impacted or need to be switched so

220
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
that's another problem we

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,440
recently added to the the draft

222
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
next page please

223
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,120
for the

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
cloud data center like mini

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
edge cloud data center in the 5g domain

226
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
encounter problems of

227
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,800
instances being extension in multiple

228
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
locations actually very close in

229
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
proximity so the routing distance alone

230
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,519
actually is minimal

231
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,160
much smaller compared with

232
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
other factors like site capacity

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
site

234
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
capability index for example

235
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,959
another issue is the source the user

236
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
device ue when they move from one cell

237
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,399
tower to another cell tower

238
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
they may maintain the same ip address so

239
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
you will encounter of

240
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
same source address actually coming from

241
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,399
different ingress routers so that's

242
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
another problem added into the the cloud

243
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,480
network

244
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,519
connecting the cloud

245
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
next page please

246
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,959
so

247
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
another issue is when you have hybrid

248
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
cloud right you have instances cloud

249
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
extension by i mean hosted by different

250
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
cloud providers and different providers

251
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
may have different net functions

252
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
so when you have a cpe connecting to

253
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,279
to different sites managed by different

254
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,920
cloud operators the net can be different

255
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
uh function can be different so uh when

256
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
we establish a connection like for

257
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
example establish an sd1 connection you

258
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
will need to

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
be notified the net feature like what

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
kind of net is support

261
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,639
so that's something

262
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
another problem which

263
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,440
haven't been defined yet

264
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
another thing is

265
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,240
discovery okay so you have instances

266
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
extension in multiple locations and how

267
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
do you quickly be able to identify what

268
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,040
are the uh possible locations where your

269
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,680
instances are located

270
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
that will help the the on-prem

271
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
router to be able to efficiently or

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
quickly

273
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,079
switch the service from one place to

274
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
another place i'll be able to optimally

275
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
choose the

276
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,600
the most optimal location for the

277
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
intended services

278
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,119
next one

279
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,399
and then the dns well this not intended

280
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
to solve dns problem but in the context

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
of routing

282
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
there are lots of resources you

283
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
extension in different cloud operators

284
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
and

285
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,160
your service the resource are local to

286
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
particular enterprise so

287
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,839
your service like your load in cloud a

288
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
may need to resolve address which is not

289
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,639
visible or not located in that

290
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,440
particular cloud operator so the dns you

291
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,760
have to set up the policy so this dns

292
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,079
query will be routed back to your

293
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
on-prem's dns and then on-prem dns will

294
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,320
be able to locate where is the next

295
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,199
cloud operator where the actual instance

296
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
is so from the

297
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,959
routing perspective how do we make

298
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
the instance the services in one cloud

299
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
talk to another cloud how do you resolve

300
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,600
the

301
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
location

302
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
that's another problem

303
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
with dns

304
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
okay

305
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,720
another issue with dns is um

306
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
the client itself may cache the dns

307
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,680
query so um if like say for example your

308
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,759
today's instance is no longer like a

309
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
single connection you connect to a to b

310
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,360
the b you want to connect to is usually

311
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,040
located in multiple places so when

312
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,079
one place one location on side part is

313
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,360
having a degradation for example um how

314
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
do you

315
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
tell the client to switch to to the next

316
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
one so if the client keep the cash make

317
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
it very

318
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
not very convenient for the client to be

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
able to initiate the switch so um that's

320
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,160
why when we have those router at the the

321
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
ingress router if they get notified

322
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
instead of client then they will be able

323
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
to switch the service to the next site

324
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
more optimally

325
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
next one

326
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,839
and then here's the gap analysis

327
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
so um with those problems um

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
this gap analysis we

329
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
made some changes

330
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
one thing is about

331
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,199
many forwarding is based on even though

332
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
they use ip address the ip address is

333
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,359
not quite the same as before because

334
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,720
each ip address may represent a cluster

335
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
of instances like for example if you

336
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
want to

337
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,160
do some kind of application based

338
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
routing the use ip address but the ipod

339
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,280
address represents many instances and

340
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
they are located in

341
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
many places

342
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
um

343
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,000
we need a simpler or simpler way to

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
represent a large number of services

345
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
when there's a site failure actually

346
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
that one has been covered

347
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
before

348
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,000
also that

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you may have different connections you

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,760
may have the vpn

351
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
nprs connections and you may have the

352
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
connection over the public internet so

353
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,880
the instance can be connected in many

354
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,600
different ways

355
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
next place

356
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
um here's just another summary um for

357
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,280
the routing area so um

358
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
the

359
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,440
the the past management right so um

360
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
when there's um

361
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,480
virtual cpe extension in the cloud can

362
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,200
be

363
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
reached by multiple paths from the

364
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,799
routing domain how do we

365
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,559
optimally select

366
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,840
the optimal

367
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,200
egress router to reach to the

368
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
optimal location

369
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
that's something need to be considered

370
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,000
because that one requires not only just

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
the traffic path itself you may need

372
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
some destination location like matrix to

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
measure different destination in terms

374
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,039
of

375
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
performance

376
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
and uh also that um um

377
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
we need the in the control plan right um

378
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,160
we need to advertise advertise the

379
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,080
network condition connecting to the

380
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
virtual nodes within the cloud dc

381
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,160
um so

382
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
there's also issues of

383
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
when we aggregate traffic

384
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
over the private path

385
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,400
and over the internet path and there

386
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,919
will be um when you have the port facing

387
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
the internet there will be security

388
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,039
issues

389
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
and

390
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,960
and also um

391
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
also how do you indicate a different

392
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
kind of

393
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,880
path available for transporting

394
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,679
in today in the bgp tunnel in cab

395
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,799
doesn't really indicate that

396
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
one client route can be

397
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,799
aggregated over public internet or over

398
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
private or both or give some kind of

399
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
policy

400
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
um

401
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,559
so that's

402
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
the next page please

403
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
so um so this draft has been two drafts

404
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
have been in the

405
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,240
rtg working group for a while

406
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,440
and i'm hoping that

407
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,080
people can give some more reviews and

408
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
we want to call for

409
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
working group last call

410
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
thank you

411
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
any questions

412
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,200
uh hi albertana

413
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
speaking as a working group participant

414
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
um thank you for doing this and for

415
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,679
documenting the requirements and the use

416
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,919
cases and the gaps and everything else

417
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,039
if we understood you at the beginning

418
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
you said that

419
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
some you added some new information

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
i'm sorry i think maybe you can take the

421
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
facebook i cannot

422
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,559
if i understood you at the beginning you

423
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,000
said that you had added some new

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,840
information to the drafts yes

425
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,520
right so what i would like to suggest to

426
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
the working group is that

427
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
you know documents like these i think i

428
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
think are very important because they're

429
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
going to guide

430
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
work on actual solutions

431
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
i know there's an edge discovery draft

432
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
in idr that references the the problem

433
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,320
statement and the gap analysis

434
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
however

435
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
publishing

436
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,600
these documents or srcs means that the

437
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
gap analysis and the problem statements

438
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,039
are frozen

439
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
there's no opportunity to add more

440
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,520
problem statements or to update the gap

441
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,159
analysis as we solve problems hopefully

442
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,720
the gaps are going to be closed right

443
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,840
right or maybe we identify new gaps

444
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
so what i would like to suggest again as

445
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,039
a working participant

446
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,080
is that

447
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,039
we maintain these documents as working

448
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
documents in the working group

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
uh you know maintained periodically

450
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
so that they're not you know frosting in

451
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,720
time

452
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,559
um today right or whenever we get to

453
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
publication so they can be they can

454
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
remain uh useful for

455
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,799
solution work

456
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,080
okay thank you thank you for the

457
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,559
suggestion also since there are new

458
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,159
information i did so please review it

459
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,320
yeah okay so the the key information we

460
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,520
added in is in the first two pages is

461
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
the bgp mismatch um when the party is

462
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
peering with many more um

463
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,120
peers uh it's not like traditional bgp

464
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
you which you have pre-agreed policy

465
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,440
with your partner you may have

466
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
negotiated policy and here when the

467
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
cloud gateway established bgp there will

468
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,200
be many more and

469
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,080
so

470
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,159
another one is the

471
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,320
number of actually that other one is

472
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
partially covered but we enhanced that

473
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
to make it more formal formally stated

474
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,600
like when you have a side a part goes

475
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
dark or degradated how do we indicate to

476
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
the um

477
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
the ingress router to do the efficient

478
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
switching so i hope people can have time

479
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
we'll have more people in the queue for

480
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,559
questions

481
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,720
um go ahead

482
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,280
and mute yourself

483
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,559
can now hear you

484
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
um

485
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,720
tnj maybe you want to speak instead

486
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,159
uh one question regarding a slide

487
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
probably the third all fourth one is

488
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,720
showing

489
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,520
a picture going from microsoft error

490
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
going through public and the provider

491
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
network

492
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
yeah for this case

493
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
actually there's another one is instead

494
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
of the provider a public there is a

495
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,039
circus

496
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,880
and the cloud provider will have its own

497
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
backup so in that scenario you may not

498
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
have

499
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
so many failure cases

500
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
as you described

501
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
thank you

502
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,010

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,760
uh vrp version three uh viz document

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,000
that that's currently rfc 57 on 98. i

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
just wanted to say that a lot of times

you know you have people you know you

514
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,480
want the right people to do these biz

515
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
documents

516
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
and uh

517
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,919
aditya is currently the lead for the uh

518
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,960
for vrv uh versions three and two

519
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,919
on the ios xc cisco xc family of uh

520
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
networking products

521
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,400
so he's qualified and as for myself i've

522
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
implemented

523
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
uh vrp version 2

524
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
at two different vendors and for vr

525
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
version three

526
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
i put proprietary constraints into it

527
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
for sd-wan integration for instance

528
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
whether or not you have an sd-wan

529
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,039
connection you have a connection to

530
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,880
control or if you don't

531
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
you don't want to

532
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,760
uh allow yourself to remaster state so i

533
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,480
think we're uniquely qualified uh to do

534
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
this

535
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,639
next slide

536
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
you have control

537
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,200
oh

538
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
let me see if i can figure this out then

539
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
yep it worked

540
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,960
okay primary motivation for this is

541
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
uh

542
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,640
not only well the first one is the ietf

543
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
has adopted the nist

544
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,320
uh

545
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
standards for inclusive language

546
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,720
which some and

547
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
those of you familiar with the vrfe

548
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
protocol know that it uses master

549
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,360
and that just about changed every page

550
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,039
and at the same time

551
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,679
uh cisco and other vendors

552
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,120
we really want to change all our our our

553
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,480
code and documentation to also have

554
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,159
inclusive language a matter of fact if

555
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,159
you go to a cisco document now you'll

556
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,120
see

557
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
on the first you know an online

558
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,039
documentation you'll see our commitment

559
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,520
to inclusive using inclusive language

560
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
and all our documentation

561
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
so

562
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
you know for some for some standards

563
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,799
it's easy to just

564
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,520
do

565
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
a

566
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
document that updates it but in the case

567
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
of erp it seems like every other

568
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,039
paragraph

569
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,559
you know the the

570
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,000
the

571
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,039
concept of master and backup was so

572
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,919
uh so much part of erp that it changed

573
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,799
every almost every other paragraph so we

574
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,159
went ahead and did divis um

575
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,279
and

576
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,600
we came up with active because you know

577
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,880
i i know that in other aha

578
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
type protocols and standards

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,480
the natural corollary

580
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,200
of backup is active

581
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
now

582
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,600
it was less and and as far as the

583
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,240
standard is concerned we figured well we

584
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
might as well back up back up if we can

585
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
and have the

586
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
least intrusive uh change

587
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,480
so that's why we did that uh we also

588
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,919
changed some instances of

589
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
black hole to talk about

590
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,799
uh

591
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,039
advertising reachability yet dropping

592
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,640
the packets

593
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
so that that was that was that was the

594
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
main impetus and we probably wouldn't

595
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,399
have dubbed is of rfc 5798 without this

596
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,840
motivation next slide

597
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,960
oh you'll have it i guess i have control

598
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,840
i'll blame it on kovac

599
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,000
uh additional changes

600
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,440
first of all

601
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,559
i'm i migrated all to xml version rfc uh

602
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,039
xml to rfc version three so it uses all

603
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
the new tags and everything and that

604
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
seemed to just do that sounds like an

605
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,200
internal change but it seemed to result

606
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,760
in better formatting just by making that

607
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
switch

608
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
there were a number of er

609
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
errata open

610
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
on all the finite state machines

611
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,440
and we fixed all of those

612
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,760
and then i went through and i did

613
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,919
editorial changes

614
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,600
there were some there were actually some

615
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
spelling errors and some

616
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,200
lots of

617
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
sentence fragments and run-on sentences

618
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
and i tried to get rid of those

619
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,399
and i also

620
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,679
tried to use cons there was also some

621
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,600
inconsistencies in the use just in the

622
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,520
in just a changing master everywhere i

623
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
saw there was inconsistencies of when it

624
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,720
was you know how it was phrased and

625
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
whether

626
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
it was master router with both uh

627
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,320
capitalized or one capitalized or

628
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,640
everything i made it consistent

629
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,919
and and

630
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
so that was so there's a lot of i i

631
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,120
believe at least i believe since

632
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
i was the main one responsible i believe

633
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
i improved the

634
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,600
the readability of the document

635
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,159
also uh thanks to a comment from pascal

636
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,240
touver we now recommend for ipv6 that

637
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
both the master and backup

638
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,120
uh accept unsolicited neighbor ad

639
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,760
advertisements as is recommended in rfc

640
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,559
9131

641
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,919
uh this was this is a recent change this

642
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,360
was just changed recently in in received

643
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
we now rec we now recommend that

644
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
validation is done on the maximum

645
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
interval

646
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,080
so that it matches when you receive vrp

647
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
packets

648
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
for background compatibility we not

649
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
discard the packets because in in rfc

650
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,600
5798 it doesn't do that but the mismatch

651
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
is logged

652
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
we removed there was a lot there was

653
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,399
there are dependencies that talk about

654
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,799
uh fddi

655
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,240
token ring and uh tm-line emulation

656
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,520
those are removed we kind of

657
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,520
cisco has pretty much

658
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
put all those products all those

659
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
technologies

660
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
and the end of life it didn't seem like

661
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
it made this it was it was necessary to

662
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,559
carry these appendices into the future

663
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,679
i

664
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,200
beat up the security uh considerations

665
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,480
and we'll probably as we go through the

666
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,440
a d and i see iesg reviews i'm sure

667
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
we'll uh beef them up even more

668
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,200
and

669
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,440
thanks to some comments from um

670
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
donald slake

671
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,840
and

672
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,960
i

673
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,279
improved the uh

674
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,159
iana section

675
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,640
next slide

676
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,799
okay

677
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,960
what i want to do is get some additional

678
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,559
reviews like i said i've gotten some

679
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,279
good reviews from drew pascal and others

680
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,799
like donald

681
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,960
uh you can look at and by the way

682
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
anybody who acknowledge who did

683
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
add it gave me a substantive comment i

684
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
put their name in the acknowledgements

685
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,080
and uh

686
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
and so i'm looking for some more good

687
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
reviews

688
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,519
uh it's a working group document now so

689
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,120
we'll give it a little time to settle

690
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,039
and then i'll probably start

691
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,519
uh pushing to see how ready we are for a

692
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,679
working work group last call i'm also

693
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,559
gonna

694
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,960
aditya and i are also gonna do both of

695
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,720
us you know like take

696
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
you know a couple hours and both of us

697
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,399
go through it line by line and look for

698
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,600
any inconsistencies

699
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,000
as far as taking brp version 3 to

700
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,840
propose standards i'm not going to do

701
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,159
this reason this i get

702
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,880
at this point i get asked to do a lot

703
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,640
more than i have time to do

704
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
and this just isn't a priority to me so

705
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
i'm not going to do this implementation

706
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
survey and report

707
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
to get it i mean consider moving to

708
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
internet standard i'm not going to do

709
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,320
this if somebody else is interested in

710
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,580
doing this uh that would be welcome

711
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,240
[Music]

712
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,799
anyway and then working group so the

713
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,320
next step would be working group class

714
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,559
call and publish so that vendors are

715
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,240
comfortable making code changes and

716
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,480
documentation changes

717
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,880
that's it

718
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,720
oh i was gonna i was gonna say

719
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,159
well i'm not interested in this i'll

720
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,799
probably uh start work once i get

721
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,440
like a weekend or something work on the

722
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,679
yang document start looking at revisions

723
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,559
to that so that we can uh change the

724
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,159
terminology in the end

725
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,720
document and i'm hoping i did yeah i

726
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
don't want to speak for him he might

727
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,840
tackle the mib because we have an

728
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,960
implement at cisco we have an

729
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
implementation of the mib as well

730
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
hi andrew alston one of the rooting

731
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,799
ideas

732
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,320
um ac i just want to say a big thank you

733
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
for this because i think

734
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799
from my perspective in in my role as ad

735
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,519
it when you get a comprehensive review

736
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,679
like this that fixes all the issues et

737
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,799
cetera

738
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,880
it's a lot easier than reviewing tons

739
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,240
and tons of erotum which fix things etc

740
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,159
and it makes the documents better and i

741
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,600
know that it's a lot of work to do a

742
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,079
document like this and i just wanted to

743
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,159
say that from my side in my role as an

744
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,839
ad this type of work is really

745
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,599
appreciated and i wish i could see more

746
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,079
of it so please keep going and thank you

747
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,679
very much

748
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,918
thank you

749
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,760
just a couple of

750
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,679
comments on on the process itself

751
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,480
it is not a requirement to publish an

752
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
implementation report

753
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,040
uh to move to internal standard so it's

754
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
nice that the working group discusses

755
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
the fact that this is deployed and used

756
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,719
and you know et cetera

757
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,480
but as we used to do years ago where we

758
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
had to publish line by line each must

759
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,399
and should and everything else

760
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,359
we don't need to do that anymore um

761
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,480
the main thing however is

762
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,760
for

763
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,560
the

764
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,400
changes from proposed standard to

765
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
internal standard to be

766
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
minimum

767
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,240
so i noticed most of what you're doing

768
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
is editorial changes

769
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,760
you mentioned a couple of technical

770
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
changes adding something for ipv6 or

771
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
something else

772
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
if we can justify that those are minimal

773
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,880
minimum changes then

774
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
it shouldn't be

775
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
a problem

776
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
as long as it's

777
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
documented in the shepherd report for

778
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,920
example that there's a pervasive

779
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,880
implementation and you know etc

780
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,200
so just keep an eye on that not don't

781
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,960
make too many changes

782
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,880
especially technically uh technical

783
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,280
changes so that uh if if the working

784
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
group wants to move this winter standard

785
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,040
then um

786
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,720
there are no there's no opposition to

787
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,760
that

788
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
thanks

789
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,640
okay

790
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,119
thank you for working on this document

791
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,320
thanks

792
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,200
on to the next presentation yeah maybe

793
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
i'll start a thread on that if we don't

794
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,800
have to do that like i am like i said

795
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,440
every um every other uh

796
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
every other paragraph is changed because

797
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,079
of the the editorial changes but i i

798
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,599
know exactly what's changed and

799
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
everything i've changed there's nothing

800
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
that's not backward compatible and it's

801
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
mainly just recommendations

802
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
that are that are ad that are changed

803
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,920
technically

804
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,880
and i don't think anybody would argue

805
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
with the things that i've done anyway

806
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,920
all right i'm gonna

807
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,160
under the mic

808
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,839
so um

809
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
i assume you want to try again

810
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
yeah

811
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,200
can you hear me now

812
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
yes

813
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
go ahead okay awesome

814
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,520
uh i believe i had some browser problems

815
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,800
um i believe now it's working fine

816
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,760
uh

817
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
i have the control right

818
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,760
yeah you can flip through the slide

819
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,880
yourself

820
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
awesome

821
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,079
okay uh hello hello everyone my name is

822
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,560
uh asim chaudhry

823
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,160
and i am going to provide updates on

824
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,279
qscan model

825
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,760
so as promised in the last idf

826
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,800
we have worked on reducing the number of

827
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
feature statements

828
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,680
primarily

829
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,599
there were too many features statement

830
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,280
which were causing interdependencies

831
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,440
we have reduced the number of feature

832
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,040
statement from 19 to 5

833
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,760
by doing that we have simplified the

834
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
model to a great extent

835
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,599
also we have kept only those feature

836
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,359
statements

837
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,520
which are very very specific to

838
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
particular vendors

839
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,480
and are not part of any particular

840
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,119
deployments typically

841
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,920
typical deployments

842
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,720
uh

843
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,320
going to the next one so uh we have also

844
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,599
worked on reducing the number of modules

845
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,880
uh as i will describe in the later slide

846
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
how we have achieved that and what are

847
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,599
the advantage of doing that

848
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,480
also in the uh as promised in the last

849
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
itf

850
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,359
uh we have added the uh operational

851
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,560
model to the

852
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,119
uh to the young model we felt very very

853
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,240
strongly

854
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,960
that as part of the configuration model

855
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
uh for the qs we should also add the

856
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
stats uh counters

857
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
uh for it to be able to complete

858
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
and so we have worked on that to add the

859
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,839
counters

860
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,079
also also we have added the qs

861
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,560
classifier and policy configuration

862
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,920
examples

863
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
and we have added to the appendix

864
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,800
section of the draft

865
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,200
also we have worked on few more young

866
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
doctor comments

867
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,440
and based on those modification

868
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,359
we are able to cover with the zero eight

869
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,480
version of the draft

870
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
okay so if we look into our current

871
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,680
qscan modules

872
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,040
we have

873
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
combined

874
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,160
uh the qs policy classifier and the

875
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,040
target module into a single module and

876
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,079
we call it as a traffic policy module

877
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,400
now the advantage of having traffic

878
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
policy module is that any particular

879
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,400
traffic related policy

880
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,119
can make use of this module as a base

881
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,079
module

882
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
and can augment or create their model of

883
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079
their own in a very very simple steps

884
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,640
as i will describe in the next slide

885
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,920
now all these blue boxes like qa section

886
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,839
the traffic policy

887
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,119
uh these are base module and the orange

888
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,200
boxes uh are derived modules so for

889
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
example

890
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,839
the diffser policy uh we have created by

891
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,079
sticking together qs action with the

892
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,359
traffic policy and adding some kind of a

893
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,240
match criterias similarly for queue

894
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
policy and scheduler policy we are able

895
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,839
to come up with a simple modules

896
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,440
okay so if somebody has to create a new

897
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,240
policy module uh they can easily make

898
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,480
use of the traffic policy model which we

899
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,800
have added as part of this draft so

900
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,040
these are the five simple steps which

901
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
somebody has to follow

902
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,680
uh for example you know somebody has to

903
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
create a new policy module

904
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,200
of the type policy forwarding so first

905
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,160
they have to define a new policy type

906
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000
second they have to define the

907
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,079
classification criteria like for example

908
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
we have given a flow tag

909
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
criteria here

910
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
and then uh next step will be to

911
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
come up with a set of actions like a

912
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,640
next hop action here

913
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
and then uh number four number five

914
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,319
steps will be augmenting those

915
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,440
classification and the action criterias

916
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,319
uh to the traffic policy module and that

917
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,000
is pretty much it somebody will be able

918
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
to come up with a new policy

919
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,359
definition or policy modules

920
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
also to describe a little bit about the

921
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,119
operational modules so the operation

922
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,040
module in cos

923
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,920
uh

924
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,640
consists of a cos interface stats

925
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,520
container which is augmented to the itf

926
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,760
interface module

927
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,560
it has per direction qs counters

928
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,359
and it consists of tagged and untagged

929
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,560
counters

930
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
now the tag counter also called name

931
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,240
counters

932
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,880
are either of the aggregated counters or

933
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,119
the non-aggregated counters so whenever

934
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,720
the counters can be combined together

935
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,960
these are aggregated counters and when

936
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,040
they cannot be counted aggregated

937
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
together but are tagged with the same

938
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,200
name uh for example we have

939
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,160
classification uh sorry uh queuing as

940
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,000
well as the metering counter they are

941
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
tagged together but cannot be combined

942
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,920
so those are of the kind of

943
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
non-aggregated counters

944
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
whether it is stack counter or untagged

945
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,359
counter there

946
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,839
they have to be of type classifier

947
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,400
uh meter or the q's counter

948
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,599
so as a next step to the draft uh

949
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,440
we will be working on the remaining yank

950
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,760
doctor comment and hopefully we should

951
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,079
be able to take care of most of the

952
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,520
comment by the next itf

953
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,480
thanks any questions

954
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,319
so um we don't have people in the queue

955
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,119
um

956
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,920
i think please continue to address the

957
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,839
comments thank you for working on the

958
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,319
document we'll move okay next

959
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,240
presentation

960
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,479
thank you

961
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
good morning

962
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,640
i'm jen

963
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,839
and i was changing here back in 2016

964
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,760
talking about enterprise multi-homing

965
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,280
can ipv6

966
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
and how destination source routing is

967
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,960
supposed to help us with that

968
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,280
and recently i got a strange feeling

969
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
that nice and changed

970
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,440
in the last six years

971
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,400
so i talked to david

972
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,440
and

973
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,240
next slide please

974
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,839
so yeah

975
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,440
apparently we

976
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,119
did have a draft

977
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,440
about

978
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,079
changes to the routing which would allow

979
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,200
the routers to take the source addresses

980
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,440
of packets into account while making

981
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,960
routing decisions

982
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
and the draft was actually making i

983
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,200
think reasonably good progress

984
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,640
and

985
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,040
authors even the authors even requested

986
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,280
a working group last call

987
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,240
but i did not find any evidence that it

988
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,280
happened

989
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,040
so the draft like died peacefully

990
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,200
like three years ago

991
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,800
and now i have

992
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,240
some interest

993
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,880
in making that stuff finally happen

994
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,680
so we revived the draft recently

995
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,319
basically area submitted essay trees

996
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,880
with just starting two more authors

997
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,119
and yes i don't know if you read it but

998
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,440
a lot of references needs to be fixed

999
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
and i'm going to fix it in the next

1000
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,640
revision

1001
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
uh next slide please

1002
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,880
so just to remind you what it's all

1003
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,400
about right

1004
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,960
there are multiple cases like

1005
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,640
ipv6 multi-homing and enterprises using

1006
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,920
providers

1007
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,520
address space

1008
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,119
actually multiple providers address

1009
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,119
space right so your

1010
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,960
host might pick up

1011
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,200
source address from

1012
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,640
one of isps and obviously that packet

1013
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,520
needs to be routed to the right uplink

1014
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,079
so we can adjust route based on

1015
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,800
destination we need to take source

1016
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,560
into account as well

1017
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,640
similar cases it's like traffic

1018
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,040
engineering or traffic segmentations in

1019
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,280
network like enterprises when you have

1020
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
something like world garden

1021
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,599
and you want some particular

1022
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,720
destinations to be reached through

1023
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,280
different paths and return traffic needs

1024
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,560
to be routed accordingly again an ipv4

1025
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,599
quite often it was sold with not in ipv6

1026
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,599
we don't want to do this so we want to

1027
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,319
make sure that

1028
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,400
we take source into account

1029
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,040
so yeah there are fewer cases listed in

1030
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,680
the draft as well so next slide please

1031
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,760
so

1032
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,040
there are two

1033
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,920
or three key things about what the draft

1034
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,520
proposes first of all the draft defines

1035
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,720
the

1036
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,000
expected behavior the specific algorithm

1037
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,480
of particular implementation can be

1038
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,880
different as long as the resulting

1039
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,400
output of that black box is exactly the

1040
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,599
same right so we defined what we expect

1041
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,079
what the routing decision is expected to

1042
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,440
be it doesn't matter how you get there

1043
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,720
so also the idea is to first

1044
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,280
select look at the destinations like

1045
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,200
traditional routers do and then after

1046
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
the router selects

1047
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,160
set of particular routes which can be

1048
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,200
used to route that package

1049
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,760
the router could also look at sources

1050
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,359
and because obviously we need backwards

1051
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,000
compatibility and we need to deal with

1052
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,240
situation when we do not care about

1053
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,440
sources the idea is that source prefix

1054
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,520
of zero zero should be basically

1055
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,000
should behave exactly the same as we

1056
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,480
have routes with no sources

1057
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,520
again

1058
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,280
the draft doesn't care how this is

1059
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,760
achieved as long as the behavior is the

1060
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,119
same

1061
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,000
next slide please

1062
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,440
so yeah

1063
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,319
i

1064
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,640
do not want to go into the details

1065
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,720
because i want this presentation to be

1066
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,800
teasers so you got curious and read the

1067
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,920
draft

1068
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,760
but

1069
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,119
like in simplified description of what's

1070
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,319
happened

1071
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,720
packet arrives to the router the router

1072
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,200
is supposed to find the most specific

1073
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
destination route

1074
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,599
no nothing new here right

1075
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,240
so if for example we have zero zero

1076
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,160
slash 32 48 and slash 64 out let's be

1077
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,119
couple

1078
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,079
routes which are slash 64.

1079
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,000
and after that

1080
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,839
if it's

1081
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,880
and after that i will look at most the

1082
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
most specific source

1083
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,720
route right

1084
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,599
it might be that there is no

1085
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,920
route much in the given source like on

1086
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,640
this slide right the packet source does

1087
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,839
not match

1088
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,960
anything

1089
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,599
we have in our selected route set in

1090
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,079
this case we repeat the process

1091
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,559
selecting less the next next most

1092
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,839
specific destination route until

1093
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
eventually you get the route which you

1094
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,359
can use i guess in the worst case

1095
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
scenario it's going to be destination

1096
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,920
zero zero source zero 0

1097
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,200
but

1098
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,880
maybe not

1099
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,839
so next slide please

1100
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,880
yeah so basically why i'm here i'd like

1101
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,119
people to read the draft and i'd like

1102
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,440
the working group to consider

1103
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,119
re-adoption call

1104
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,599
for this so we can move forward

1105
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,599
i don't know if anything changes

1106
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,680
drastically in the world

1107
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,960
since 2019 when the draft was reviewed

1108
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,559
last time hopefully not but if you think

1109
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,040
otherwise please let us know

1110
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,400
and

1111
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,640
comments questions suggestions

1112
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,200
complaints

1113
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,800
i think since this been oh well so i

1114
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,280
encourage people to reveal it and see

1115
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,040
whether people are interested in this

1116
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,359
topic

1117
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,880
this microphone works um i'm adrian

1118
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,440
farrell thanks jen you teased me i read

1119
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,480
it

1120
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,640
um

1121
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,400
it's good to have this documented uh

1122
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,640
and i see no reason why the working

1123
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,680
group shouldn't pick it up again

1124
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,920
thank you for the large interrupt

1125
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,440
section

1126
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
and also the

1127
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,359
the various notes about uh loop

1128
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,599
uh potential

1129
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,839
i think that's

1130
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,920
important i'd be failing in my life

1131
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,119
mission if i didn't note that this is

1132
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,920
something i would call semantic routing

1133
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,280
because it's rooting

1134
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,960
on something beyond simply the

1135
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,880
destination address

1136
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,559
and that's great

1137
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,400
so i'd encourage you to look at our

1138
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,119
challenges in semantic routine draft

1139
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,319
which i suspect you will find

1140
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,920
pretty much apple pie stuff

1141
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,160
but it should serve as a checklist of

1142
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,680
things just to

1143
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,480
go through and say well i'll be

1144
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,640
considering for example are we

1145
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,599
considering the amount of existing route

1146
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,240
uh sorry additional routing information

1147
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,440
that is going to get carried into

1148
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,640
protocols as a result of doing this

1149
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,040
and uh and what are the convergence

1150
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,480
implications and things like that and i

1151
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,079
think that's just worth thinking about

1152
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,920
as you go along

1153
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,400
thank you

1154
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,680
hi andrew alston speaking just as a

1155
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,599
working group participant

1156
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,720
um jen so i've taken a very brief route

1157
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,559
of this document and i just wanted to

1158
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,400
find out from

1159
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,760
the authors if they'd done any looking

1160
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,400
at

1161
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,200
what this type of routing could do to

1162
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,960
line speed in the forwarding plane etc

1163
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,520
um and whether or not you've you've

1164
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,920
looked at if there are any implications

1165
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,000
and whether this can be done at line

1166
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,520
rate in the vendors

1167
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,000
i'm just to try and get a sense of where

1168
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,440
we're going and what effects this could

1169
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,400
have on hardware

1170
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,240
ah

1171
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,319
david you

1172
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,359
uh that was important to answer that um

1173
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,280
i did actually look at some of the

1174
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,599
silicone capabilities and it varies a

1175
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,640
lot

1176
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,599
um for some silicon can do it and they

1177
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,680
generally do it through the acl engine

1178
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,000
which is more limited than normal

1179
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,240
forwarding capabilities

1180
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,640
but we don't have an actual good data

1181
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,640
set on this this is basically just i

1182
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,119
have a few data points only

1183
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,359
and if anyone can add information on

1184
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,800
this i would greatly appreciate that

1185
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,480
yeah obviously there is a like again

1186
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,040
checking the net problem hard to find

1187
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
how fast people can do things which do

1188
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,480
not exist and you don't define are not

1189
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,520
defined yet right so yeah any feedback

1190
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,920
from vendors hardware vendors is really

1191
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,240
welcome so if you run into the mic

1192
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,800
telling me it's not possible to get it

1193
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
done at all

1194
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,000
like yeah i'd like to hear that or if

1195
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,599
you're gonna tell me that

1196
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,000
piece of cape we can do this

1197
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,680
i'll be even more happy to hear that

1198
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,160
so is it a good news or bad news so

1199
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,960
darren duke cisco um

1200
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,880
uh yeah it's it's varied depending on

1201
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,720
the hardware for the type of hardware

1202
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
you're looking at

1203
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,599
it's a doable thing

1204
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,400
thank you made my day

1205
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,280
uh ac you're next

1206
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,920
yeah ac linda cisco systems so i notice

1207
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,640
i noticed that if you're doing this

1208
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,400
you uh

1209
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,440
you you do it you take the source

1210
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,040
as the most

1211
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,920
uh

1212
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,800
relevant key

1213
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,680
as opposed to so so if this is this the

1214
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,079
source the source routing overrides you

1215
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,839
do the source routing first and then you

1216
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,599
then you do the uh

1217
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,599
destination route

1218
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,480
uh

1219
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,440
no we look we no no no no we first look

1220
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,200
at the destination like traditional

1221
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
routers would do because the most

1222
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,160
specific destinations get a subset of

1223
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,440
routes for more specific destination and

1224
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,440
then look if there is anything much in

1225
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,000
the source as a most specific source and

1226
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,240
if there is an empty set so nothing much

1227
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,760
in the source you move to the less

1228
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,599
specific destination destination is

1229
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,880
first

1230
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,720
okay destination is still first okay

1231
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,640
yeah i i don't see any problem with it

1232
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,240
then either

1233
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,799
good thing

1234
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,480
joey you are next

1235
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,000
okay uh gene uh in fact i'm a

1236
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,839
a little uh

1237
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,720
confused uh about this work because you

1238
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,520
know

1239
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,800
we have this the flows back route or the

1240
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,920
acr

1241
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,559
uh when they do the forwarding we will

1242
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,240
match the destination and the source and

1243
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,680
not only destination source but also

1244
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,480
uh

1245
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,520
designation port and the source port

1246
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,040
so i think the esl or the flows back

1247
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,799
may also satisfy the requirement i'm not

1248
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,799
sure what's the difference between the

1249
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,040
two

1250
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,080
[Music]

1251
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,599
i think i need to think about that

1252
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,079
i am

1253
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
oh david has an answer um

1254
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,839
um flossback is supposed to do

1255
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,440
rule-based

1256
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,760
um like filtering and

1257
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,720
it's generally applied in parallel

1258
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,119
and i you wouldn't use flowspec to build

1259
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,000
a routing table normally

1260
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,839
yeah so i don't know probably we can

1261
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,680
take it offline and think about it

1262
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,119
because yeah i'm just

1263
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,240
i think i'm going to say something

1264
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,160
really stupid if i start responding

1265
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,240
right away right so yeah let's take it

1266
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,440
to the list probably here if you can uh

1267
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,520
then if you can send this to the list

1268
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,520
we'll

1269
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,680
think about it thank you thank you dean

1270
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,960
tomaso you are next

1271
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,520
hello can you hear me

1272
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,720
yes

1273
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,720
okay let me share my screen

1274
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,640
is the screen sharing

1275
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,000
yeah um i granted it

1276
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,520
okay okay i i

1277
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,040
okay okay

1278
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,240
hello

1279
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,400
my name is and i'm a phd student of

1280
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,200
computer networks at gumatech university

1281
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,400
and i'm here today for presenting ucb a

1282
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,920
framework for evaluating the

1283
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,319
implementation of accounting protocols

1284
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,760
input trees

1285
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,680
this is a joint work between a

1286
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,359
grammatical university in italy and the

1287
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,520
university of obligate in uh

1288
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,160
so what is the problem that we tried to

1289
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,480
solve the world we know that the

1290
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,200
networks are complex and characterized

1291
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,359
by high density networks and with a wide

1292
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,119
variety of routing protocols with

1293
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,200
heterogeneous implementations

1294
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,880
and devices

1295
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,119
moreover we know that a great part of

1296
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,040
the failures in these networks are

1297
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,520
caused by software bugs or configuration

1298
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,640
errors

1299
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,960
and in this contest we found a lack of

1300
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,079
standard testing procedures and tools

1301
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,640
for assessing rubbing protocols and this

1302
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,559
motivates an effort in developing

1303
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,359
solutions for such a critical task

1304
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,240
so our goals were principally two

1305
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,319
first to define a methodology for

1306
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,680
testing accounting protocol

1307
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,200
implementations

1308
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,599
and second to develop a framework that

1309
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,280
implements the methodology and that can

1310
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,440
be exploited to test the real routing

1311
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,400
accountable implementations

1312
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,720
we focus on data centers since they are

1313
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,400
the core of the modern internet

1314
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,040
infrastructure and we analyze factories

1315
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,599
since they are the most used topologies

1316
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,359
however the framework can be easily

1317
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,280
modified to support different

1318
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,520
clause-based topologies

1319
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,599
the aim is to verify the real

1320
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,440
implementation's behavior and not to

1321
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,359
measure their performance that heavily

1322
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,558
depends on artwork

1323
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,160
um

1324
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,920
before starting with the methodology a

1325
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,400
bit of notation we adopted the

1326
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,319
terminology of the gift draft for

1327
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,960
describing of a tree so we have top of

1328
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,640
fabric in the aggregation layer

1329
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,160
pods are composed of leaf and spine

1330
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,319
nodes

1331
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,400
we have that key leaf is the number of

1332
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
interfaces of a leaf pointing to the

1333
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,640
spine and that k top is the number of

1334
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,040
interfaces of a spine pointing north or

1335
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,079
south

1336
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,480
finally we have that r is the redundancy

1337
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,480
factor

1338
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,280
so our methodology is based on the

1339
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,040
following milestones

1340
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,040
first factories have regular

1341
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,680
characteristics and this allows to focus

1342
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,920
on specific elements to obtain results

1343
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,920
with a general value

1344
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,160
second performing tests that measure the

1345
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,240
actual times can be misleading since

1346
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,920
timings heavily depend on the used

1347
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,559
hardware so we try to evaluate the

1348
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,960
implementations being oblivious as much

1349
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,040
as possible with respect to the actual

1350
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,119
timings and this also allows a

1351
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,200
normalization of the test results

1352
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
independently from the execution

1353
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,359
environment

1354
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,760
um third

1355
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,520
since traveling protocols can be

1356
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,920
conceptually very different we adopt a

1357
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,000
black box method that is regarding as

1358
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,240
much as possible the internals of the

1359
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,118
implementations

1360
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,520
the methodology defines two main test

1361
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,640
categories failure and recovery failure

1362
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,640
tests and use many types of common

1363
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,040
faults in data centers and measure how

1364
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,359
implementation react to those faults

1365
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,040
while the recovery tests measure how

1366
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,119
implementations react when the network

1367
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,280
is restored from a vote

1368
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,200
to cover all the failure and recovers

1369
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
these cases we define a failure and

1370
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,359
recovery test for each type of node and

1371
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,400
for each type of link

1372
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,599
for each test we analyze four main

1373
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,559
aspects the convergence the messaging

1374
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,119
load the locality of the event and the

1375
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,359
rounds that is a novel metric that will

1376
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,000
be explained after

1377
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,319
the first aspect we considered is the

1378
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,720
master category convergent and obviously

1379
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,799
the aims is to check that after an event

1380
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,799
the nodes data blame for working table

1381
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,400
reach the expected state

1382
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,280
the second aspect is the messenging load

1383
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,920
the purpose is to determine if the

1384
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,720
protocol hoverhead grows smoothly with

1385
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,680
respect to the topology parameters that

1386
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,160
are the values of k and r

1387
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
[Music]

1388
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,520
to evaluate the ability of an

1389
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,400
implementation to limit the blast radius

1390
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,480
of a failure already cover event the

1391
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,040
methodology defines a locality metric

1392
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,799
that is computed with the following

1393
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,480
algorithm

1394
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,400
first we count the number of packets

1395
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,440
that reverse each link of the network

1396
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,920
after we assign a topological distance

1397
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,920
to each link computed as the distance

1398
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,200
from the event

1399
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
and after we compute the total number of

1400
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,359
packets received at a certain

1401
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,440
topological distance

1402
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,839
the result is a vector where each

1403
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,599
element is the number of packets

1404
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,559
captured at a specific distance and we

1405
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,200
summarize it into a scalar value giving

1406
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,040
a larger weight to packets that are

1407
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,160
fragged from the event

1408
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,359
the way locality is considered allows to

1409
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,760
achieve the blast radius of an event but

1410
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,000
it doesn't give any information about

1411
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,520
the number of accounts when this happens

1412
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,760
packets could be received all at the

1413
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,559
same time or in different timings

1414
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,119
however considering this this aspect of

1415
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,119
being oblivious as much as possible with

1416
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,520
respect to diaspora timing is a

1417
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,599
challenging task and to do that the

1418
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,839
methodology introduces another

1419
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,640
representation that describes how the

1420
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,119
states of node are synchronized by

1421
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,040
routing protocol packets

1422
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,720
we call it not state graph here we have

1423
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,440
an example of a k equals two r equals

1424
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,839
two factorial and another state graph

1425
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,720
relative to an event on this topology

1426
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,440
a node in the graph represents a switch

1427
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,640
of the network in a certain state while

1428
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,119
an edge represents a set of packets from

1429
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,359
the upper node that contributes changing

1430
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,599
the state of the lower node

1431
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,599
in particular this node states graph is

1432
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,000
the one generated by a leaf node failure

1433
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,359
on a bgp implementation

1434
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,440
to compute the node state graph from the

1435
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,039
outside we use an intermediate

1436
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,880
representation called the node state

1437
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,680
timeline so let's consider our usual

1438
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,440
example of a leaf node failure on a

1439
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,200
bgpk2 r2 topology we will see how we can

1440
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,280
compute the not state graph starting

1441
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,039
from the timeline

1442
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,480
to construct the timeline we considering

1443
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,960
the signaling pdus captured in the

1444
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,280
network during the event

1445
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,079
that are update packets in this case and

1446
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,559
then for each node we order the pdus by

1447
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,680
development of time

1448
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,240
packets are then partitioned into sets

1449
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,319
of consecutive sent packets called

1450
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,400
sending group and of consecutive

1451
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,119
received packets called receiving group

1452
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,680
this operation is executed for all the

1453
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,000
nodes in the network

1454
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,200
now let's consider spine11 that is the

1455
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,319
first node to react to the failure its

1456
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,760
sending group

1457
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,880
corresponds to the initial state of one

1458
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,400
one one in the node state graph

1459
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,200
it sends three packets that

1460
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,440
contributes to change the state of

1461
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,000
relief one zero two the

1462
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,799
tough one to one and of one to two

1463
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,720
the same thing can be applied for

1464
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,740
spine112

1465
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,819
[Music]

1466
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,160
now let's go down in the intermediate in

1467
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,079
the graph to the intermediate node the

1468
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,680
leaf 102 its state is composed of a

1469
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,359
period of receiving group and sending

1470
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,520
group in the timeline

1471
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,599
its ending group is composed by two

1472
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,280
packets sent

1473
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,799
to the spine in the same pod

1474
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,960
so we create an intermediate node in the

1475
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,839
graph for each node that presents a pair

1476
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,680
of consecutive receiving group and

1477
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,640
sending group in the timeline

1478
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,680
finally let's consider the nodes at the

1479
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,680
lower level in the graph

1480
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,319
their state is composed by only

1481
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,400
receiving groups because no other

1482
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,319
transmission are needed in the network

1483
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,359
for handling the failure

1484
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,240
okay we now know how to build a

1485
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,640
non-state graph but what can we do with

1486
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,280
it

1487
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,160
well this graph allows to perceive the

1488
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,240
number of state changes that the network

1489
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,400
directs us before the convergence

1490
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,720
because this state changes rounds and

1491
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,720
using the graph for each vertex we can

1492
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,799
compute the number of rounds as the

1493
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,599
length of the longest path from

1494
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,000
swords to that vertex

1495
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,480
and we call this measure state run value

1496
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,799
of a vertex

1497
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,119
moreover we can compute the maximum

1498
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,440
value among the states run values of the

1499
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,240
vertices and we call this a state run

1500
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,319
value of the graph

1501
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,240
and in this example you see it easy to

1502
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,200
notice

1503
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,680
that the state run value of the graph

1504
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,170
is four

1505
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,880
[Music]

1506
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,480
okay now i have

1507
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,640
introduced the methodology a little bit

1508
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,520
so i can start to talk about sible

1509
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,079
sibila is a software framework that

1510
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,240
implements the methodology leveraging on

1511
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,480
network emulation to run real software

1512
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,920
implementation

1513
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,559
it allows to automatically deploy and

1514
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,280
run repeatable tests on victor for trees

1515
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,440
allowing to build a testing pipeline on

1516
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,280
data center networks

1517
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,839
sibil already provides all the code base

1518
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,280
for the test described in the

1519
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,599
methodology and some basic templates

1520
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,079
that can be easily easily extended to

1521
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,319
create custom scenarios

1522
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,119
for doing these c build presents some

1523
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,440
utilities and codebacks to interact with

1524
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,079
the laws of the topology

1525
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,480
the simple architecture presents levels

1526
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
of modifiability and assemble existing

1527
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,960
tools with new ones specifically device

1528
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,480
for the purpose

1529
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,720
for the network emulation we we choose

1530
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,960
katakana category is a container-based

1531
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,760
network emulator developed that commater

1532
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,200
and we choose it

1533
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,760
since it can leverage on kubernetes for

1534
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,079
the virtualization and dance it is able

1535
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,319
to scale up in a cluster to faithfully

1536
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:30,000
emulate large-scale networks

1537
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
um okay but how does it work civil what

1538
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,039
is what did it

1539
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,280
do during an experiment

1540
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,440
uh well basically it generates and they

1541
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,760
produce a topology it starts to capture

1542
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,000
all the pdu's and then it starts the

1543
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,160
routing protocol

1544
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,160
after he performs the required action

1545
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,160
for a specific type of test like another

1546
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,839
failure and then it performs the

1547
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,240
convergency check to ensure that the

1548
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,880
protocol has converted

1549
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,720
after each shutdown the containers and

1550
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,880
then it performs the analysis on the

1551
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
damped traffic of putting the results

1552
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,440
without the metric and some novel

1553
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,079
and some graphics interactive graphics

1554
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,559
to monitoring the network

1555
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,920
okay but

1556
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,599
what can we do with cbi well there are

1557
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,599
many possible use cases and in the

1558
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,160
following we will see some of them a

1559
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,480
first possible use case is the complete

1560
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,240
analysis of a routing protocol

1561
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,280
implementation as example we decided to

1562
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,599
analyze bgp since it is the de facto

1563
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,000
standard for plus-based data centers

1564
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,160
and we choose the africa routing bgp

1565
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,680
implementation

1566
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,920
we executed all the tests of the

1567
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,440
methodologies of technologies up to 10

1568
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,520
chapters and more than

1569
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,000
33 000 interfaces

1570
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,599
in the next i'll present you only a

1571
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,680
summary of the results but you can find

1572
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,839
all in the repository and in the

1573
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,760
paper so from a messenging load the

1574
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,079
perspective we found that implementation

1575
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,920
does not manifest any performance

1576
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,400
degradation varying k and our

1577
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,319
motherboard we found that the number of

1578
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,079
packets exchanged by node is not

1579
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,839
affected by the number of nodes in the

1580
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,839
network but it only depends on the

1581
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,720
number of interfaces of that node

1582
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,880
on the locality side we have the

1583
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,960
implementation of fluids of the nodes

1584
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,439
when an event happens in the network

1585
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,479
and finally from the rounds analysis

1586
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,399
we have that the ferrari bgp shows a

1587
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,040
very stable behavior in fact given a

1588
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,520
specific test scenario it requires the

1589
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,600
same number of rounds to converge and

1590
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,359
here the topology sites does not matter

1591
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,600
i want to show you only an example of

1592
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,439
the graphs automatically produced by

1593
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,679
siebel these are representations are

1594
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,600
very intuitive and they can be exploited

1595
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,080
to reason about locality and rounds

1596
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,479
on the left you can find a topology

1597
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,319
label with the number of packets that

1598
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,640
traverse each link during an event and

1599
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,158
this could be very helpful to think

1600
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,560
about locality for example we can easily

1601
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,960
notice that exactly two packets are

1602
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,439
exchanged on each link on the right we

1603
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,439
have an odd state graph it presents a

1604
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,319
maximum ground value of 4 and we found

1605
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,560
this value on all the other topologies

1606
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,560
for a leaf node failure this graph is

1607
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,640
interactive so you can find information

1608
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,479
about the buckets that contributed to

1609
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,238
change another state by clicking on

1610
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,319
nodes or edges

1611
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,238
a second possible use case is the

1612
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,640
development and testing of prototypes a

1613
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,719
year we focus on a gift pattern the only

1614
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,560
open source available implementation of

1615
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,759
a gift a gift is a hybrid links state

1616
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,158
distance vector protocol that aims at

1617
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,640
minimizing configuration and operational

1618
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,960
complexity it includes some novel

1619
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,399
mechanisms such as the negative

1620
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,080
disaggregation which allows the

1621
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,319
automatic prefix aggregation in piece of

1622
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,719
failures and during our analysis we

1623
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,799
found some scalability issues which are

1624
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,319
expected since the python

1625
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,920
implementations

1626
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,920
aim only to ensure the correctness of

1627
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,280
the draft

1628
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,440
moreover with python we found that read

1629
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,880
python was missing the negative

1630
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,120
disaggregation feature so we decided to

1631
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,199
implement it building a testing pipeline

1632
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,280
on cb to test all the code changes in

1633
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,640
all these scenarios

1634
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,560
we also verified the interaction between

1635
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,120
nodes leveraging on timelines and on and

1636
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,520
on the node state graphs and this was a

1637
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,360
very valuable support during the

1638
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,280
development

1639
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,920
moreover since our matrix don't consider

1640
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,480
template aspects they are also suitable

1641
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,800
for evaluating prototypes in the paper

1642
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,719
you can find a comparison on how this

1643
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,840
python performs against ferrari bgp on

1644
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,520
the topologies where the implementation

1645
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,000
converges we found however that risk

1646
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,159
python even a physical prototype

1647
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,719
prototype exhibits results showing the

1648
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,320
credible potential especially from a

1649
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,239
locality point of view as you can see

1650
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,960
from the pictures where

1651
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,719
in case of a leaf failure leaf only

1652
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,679
fluids the lift only floats the nodes

1653
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,840
inside the part where the voltage

1654
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,360
happens

1655
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,360
a third possible use case is the test of

1656
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,000
flooding reduction algorithms recently

1657
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,760
there has been a lot of effort to

1658
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,679
develop flooding reduction techniques

1659
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,239
for data centers and cbd can be used to

1660
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,239
compare and evaluate the flooding

1661
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,000
flooding reduction algorithm

1662
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,600
implementations

1663
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,520
we perform a comparison between a

1664
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,360
ferragaya stylus and the flag open

1665
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,560
fabric

1666
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,480
anaya says modification that aims to

1667
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,239
reduce the flooding in a leaf spine

1668
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,719
topologies you can find all the results

1669
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,800
in the repository year for time reason i

1670
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,480
only showed the node state graph for a

1671
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,600
lip knot failure on a k2r2 topology and

1672
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,360
as you can see here the effects of the

1673
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,840
flooding reduction are easily noticeable

1674
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,679
with the knot stage graph of open fabric

1675
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,640
that becomes a tree

1676
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,920
other possible use cases are the bug

1677
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,080
finished sorry uh are the bug and

1678
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,920
inefficiency inspection using the not

1679
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,760
state graph you can find an example of

1680
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,360
it in the paper where we spot some

1681
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,040
inefficiencies in the juniper rift

1682
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,960
implementation also we have the

1683
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,040
verification of category configuration

1684
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,120
and the test of interoperability between

1685
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,719
implementation of different vendors

1686
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,640
i am at the end so thank you for your

1687
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,040
time here you can find some useful links

1688
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,440
and some contacts you can find also the

1689
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,040
mail of mariano that is the colleague

1690
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,360
guy we i work with on the development of

1691
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,360
sible if you have a question i am happy

1692
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,440
to answer but if we are out of time feel

1693
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,679
free to contact me in private

1694
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,880
or send anime also to mariano thank you

1695
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,320
for the opportunity to be here

1696
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,719
tony go ahead

1697
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,440
yeah let me talk clearly 20p juniper

1698
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,400
so

1699
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,880
full disclosure i mean i i work with

1700
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,560
them pretty closely since quite a long

1701
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,440
time

1702
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,960
um

1703
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,520
i highly encourage people who are heavy

1704
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,800
into routing protocol special

1705
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,679
implementation to have a deep look at

1706
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,600
this stuff because this goes far beyond

1707
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,920
a framework that allows you to compare

1708
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,840
you know protocols

1709
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,679
and um

1710
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,760
find interesting bugs you know they

1711
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,159
kicked a couple of things out of my

1712
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,679
implementation which

1713
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,360
stuff was working just fine and we

1714
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,800
didn't look for like

1715
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,159
correctness we were looking for

1716
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,920
correctness in terms of ultimate i think

1717
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,440
converge timing and so on that they

1718
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,199
found stuff that were

1719
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,480
due to protocol inherent

1720
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,480
self-stabilization was working fine but

1721
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,800
it was not efficient right we were like

1722
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,400
retransmitting too often something like

1723
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,600
this

1724
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,280
so that's

1725
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,199
very applicable immediate interest but

1726
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,440
the framework they're building um is

1727
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,560
actually allowing uh to observe this

1728
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,800
distributed system in a very formal way

1729
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,880
like leslie lamport kind of vector clock

1730
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,560
graph if you do it

1731
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,040
and that could lead us to a point where

1732
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,159
we actually

1733
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,400
can

1734
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,840
we can start to think with a

1735
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,760
formal proof of correctness of routing

1736
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,560
protocols is

1737
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,640
viable because until today we just don't

1738
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,760
know

1739
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,400
ospf converges yes but who said we don't

1740
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,640
have any formal proof bgp we all know i

1741
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,719
mean stable oscillations and so on and

1742
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,679
this kind of framework

1743
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,960
gives us an access to an algebra which

1744
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,800
is a complete game changer right so i

1745
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
highly encourage people to like at least

1746
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
read the paper or otherwise just kick

1747
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,440
off

1748
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,360
it's a phenomenal firm framework lots of

1749
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,120
people are using it on the in the

1750
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,400
container

1751
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,320
world but the scope of the stuff is

1752
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,960
bigger than just you know some

1753
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,960
new nice graph and a little bit of

1754
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,040
comparison protocols so this is the

1755
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,159
immediate use yeah thanks

1756
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,960
thank you thank you

1757
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,199
very thanks john

1758
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,599
go ahead

1759
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,199
hello

1760
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,159
this looks really neat and you said that

1761
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,760
you implemented the negative

1762
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,280
disaggregation

1763
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,640
and we i don't didn't get much feedback

1764
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,159
on on it and

1765
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,840
uh whether it's really useful and

1766
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,520
whether it performs and since you

1767
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,920
mentioned deltamin i would have liked to

1768
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,239
see yeah how

1769
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,320
it improved the situation or made it

1770
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,080
worse

1771
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,840
did the negative disaggregation really

1772
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,239
perform as expected is it

1773
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:09,440
was there some surprise about it

1774
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,320
we inverted the negative disaggregation

1775
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,600
using the

1776
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,080
rift implementation so

1777
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,239
uh using the juniper implementation of

1778
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,640
tony so i don't know because in the

1779
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,440
refinement yes it works as expected when

1780
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,480
he implemented it but

1781
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,280
this implementation is written in python

1782
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,560
so it has uh it converges only on very

1783
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,719
small topologies and i think that we

1784
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,000
cannot

1785
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,380
state that it's working well there

1786
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,470
[Music]

1787
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,560
well

1788
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,000
if you want to

1789
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,480
think about this something please ask us

1790
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,440
china mobile

1791
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,760
here about looking at the you are

1792
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,840
showing a picture i forget which one but

1793
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,080
the probably the first

1794
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,880
it's called the fed

1795
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,480
factory not notation

1796
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,640
the things for the cloud data center are

1797
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,840
in the price data center uh actually

1798
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,120
there are multiple plans the first it's

1799
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,120
just uh it's not restricted to only one

1800
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,679
plan the second part is you're not

1801
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,280
showing is

1802
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,199
like a virtual port channel

1803
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,719
like a cisco

1804
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,040
brocade they have a virtual fabric

1805
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,159
arista amlag c-lag

1806
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,960
extreme all kinds of things

1807
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,159
so when you consider the thing together

1808
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,120
a stand alone like the leaf span super

1809
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,840
span node will not be considered by

1810
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,679
itself only actually going to be

1811
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,840
aggregate in that case

1812
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,040
see

1813
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,560
i have to acknowledge i haven't read

1814
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,040
through your work but from your

1815
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,880
presentation it seems

1816
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,440
you put everything by itself without

1817
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,840
considering the thought tolerance

1818
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,239
mechanism that have been put into the

1819
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,800
cloud or enterprise data centers

1820
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,840
so if without my insight so have you

1821
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,679
ever evaluated

1822
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,719
the impact of quickerness of your work

1823
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,159
thank you

1824
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,559
thank you

1825
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,199
my dad if you want to say something

1826
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,400
yeah

1827
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,360
i just wanted to encourage tom to thomas

1828
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,199
to continue this work i'm really happy

1829
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,719
to see this here

1830
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,679
and i hope to see the team on regular

1831
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,719
basis updating us that has been tested

1832
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,960
and so obviously you will see more

1833
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,520
comments coming from more enterprise

1834
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,800
people so

1835
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,320
the comment about of use uh mc lock is

1836
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,920
proper one

1837
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,719
and if you have more time probably could

1838
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,840
look in less hyperscale topologies into

1839
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,960
more enterprise development but

1840
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,880
practically it's really good work and

1841
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,800
thank you for doing

1842
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,640
thank you thank you you will sure

1843
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,000
continue

1844
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,160
on

1845
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,600
[Music]

1846
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,760
thank you for the presentation so i just

1847
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,920
want to bring people's attention this is

1848
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,040
not a draft-based presentation if you

1849
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,760
are interested in the framework you can

1850
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,040
contact tamaso directly or you can send

1851
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,400
questions to the mailing list thank you

1852
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,879
thank you

1853
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,159
hey just a quick one you want to post

1854
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,280
the links on the uh on on the on the

1855
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,679
routing working group list because you

1856
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,320
know in the pdf version of the uh draft

1857
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,920
there's no link

1858
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,440
for the paper and what everything

1859
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,159
links to the paper

1860
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,560
either end of the words in the

1861
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,480
present hello

1862
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,640
can you help me

1863
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,719
yeah go ahead

1864
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,560
oh okay thanks

1865
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,280
hello everyone this is ben ying from

1866
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,760
china mobile i will present the srv6

1867
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,199
multi-home

1868
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,080
egress protection

1869
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,560
next night please

1870
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,280
you have control yourself

1871
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,080
oh okay

1872
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,400
bottom of your screen

1873
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,800
okay

1874
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,600
this this job to provide

1875
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,719
a simplified protection

1876
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,280
uh magnesium of fast failure for

1877
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,120
multi-home egress scenarios

1878
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,159
the main point of this solution are as

1879
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,760
follows

1880
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,120
firstly carry the seat of the backup

1881
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,159
egress in the sih nest entry of the

1882
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,600
package

1883
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,920
secondly expand the sih flags field to

1884
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,719
indicate that the backup seat is carried

1885
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,199
in the segment list

1886
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:06,400
thirdly when the penultimate endpoint

1887
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,360
receives the package and finds that its

1888
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,320
next hope direct labor is the egress

1889
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,920
note and is unreachable it changed the

1890
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,400
destination address of the package to

1891
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,440
the backup seed

1892
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,719
okay the uh this slide shows the

1893
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,639
extension of

1894
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,320
sih flex

1895
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:37,120
which defines the b flag in the s h flex

1896
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,040
if the b flag is set to 1 a backup seat

1897
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,600
is carried in the segment list

1898
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,960
and only when the penultimate

1899
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,360
endpoint receives the package with b

1900
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,600
flag setting it will execute the egress

1901
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,239
fast switching process

1902
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,679
if the b flag is set to zero

1903
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,440
backup seat is not carried

1904
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,280
this is the procedure of multi-home

1905
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,560
equestria

1906
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,480
protection of srv60 paths

1907
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,080
as shown in the picture one pe one is

1908
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,199
the ingress node and p3 is the primary

1909
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,639
ingress node

1910
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,120
p4

1911
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,560
are you sharing slides

1912
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,880
oh

1913
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,840
can you hear

1914
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,080
okay can you share the slides

1915
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,040
i i shared the slice

1916
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,520
we are sharing

1917
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,400
we can see the slide

1918
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,760
can you see the slice

1919
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,520
yes i can

1920
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,480
there were also another comment right uh

1921
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,960
wayne please continue

1922
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
oh okay

1923
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
uh this is the procedure of the

1924
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,520
multi-home egress protection protection

1925
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,840
on srv60

1926
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,520
path

1927
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,960
in this

1928
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,600
as shown in the picture one

1929
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,840
p

1930
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,639
p1

1931
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,120
is the ingress note and the p3 p3 is the

1932
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,320
primary egress note and p4 is the backup

1933
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,920
egress note

1934
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,040
when

1935
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,360
when the ingress node p1 encapsulates

1936
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,280
the srh srh header judge whether the

1937
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,800
primary vpn seat of the egress node has

1938
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,480
a backup sheet

1939
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,440
if yes insert the backup seat into the

1940
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,000
position of srh nast

1941
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,239
nast entry and set b flag to 1 to

1942
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,199
identify that the backup seat has been

1943
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,520
carried in the last position of the

1944
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,199
segment list

1945
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:11,360
then the value of sl is set to n m

1946
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,800
and minus one

1947
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,440
and minus one

1948
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,760
normally the traffic

1949
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,639
is

1950
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,880
forwarded along the path

1951
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,280
p1 p2 p3 and the c2

1952
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,400
when

1953
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,000
when the

1954
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,639
when the p3 fails

1955
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,880
p2

1956
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,880
finds out that the

1957
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,040
pe 3 state is unreachable and the b flag

1958
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,880
value is set

1959
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,920
the p2 modified the destination address

1960
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,360
of the packet to srh last entry

1961
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,960
which which is a backup seed and sent

1962
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,520
the modified packet to backup egress

1963
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,840
node p4

1964
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,400
through this method p2 can provide fast

1965
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,159
protection for the egress failure

1966
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,800
okay

1967
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,719
uh here is an example of srv60 path

1968
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,080
scenario

1969
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,920
when pe1

1970
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,360
received the packet from c1 to c2

1971
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,440
p1 in capsule

1972
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,480
in encapsulates the package with ipv6

1973
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,000
header and inserts the backup egress

1974
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,400
seat a4

1975
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,400
column column 100

1976
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,000
into the production of srh last entry

1977
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the second list in sih is designed as

1978
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
a11821

1979
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,040
a3100 a4 100.

1980
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,600
the sl is set to 2

1981
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,360
the last entry is set to 3 and b flag is

1982
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,679
set to 1.

1983
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:06,639
when p2 receives a packet

1984
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,360
that's destined to end

1985
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,520
and dot exit a2 column column one

1986
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,320
in normal operations it forwards the

1987
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,960
packet with resource

1988
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,040
a zero color color one and the

1989
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,679
destination ps3 vpn seat a3 column

1990
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,440
column 100

1991
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,679
from the link between b p2 and the p3

1992
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,000
according to and dot exceed

1993
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,159
when the

1994
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:42,880
p3 fails p2 receive the packet

1995
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,360
to be sent to a

1996
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,719
a3

1997
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,600
column column 100 and finds that the

1998
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,000
outgoing interface is done

1999
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,760
if the black if the b flag is setting p2

2000
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,239
changes destination address of the

2001
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,840
packet with the backup seat of srh

2002
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,800
3

2003
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,400
removes srh extension head and sends the

2004
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:12,320
modified packet to a4 column column 100.

2005
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,960
when p4 receives the modified package it

2006
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,639
the capsule

2007
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,920
encapsulates the packet and forwards the

2008
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,080
package by executing and dot dt6

2009
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,559
behavior

2010
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,880
this is an example of

2011
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,000
srv6be pass scenario

2012
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,080
the multi-home egress note

2013
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,960
protection processing on the sr

2014
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,520
v6b path is consistent with that on the

2015
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,480
srv60 path

2016
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,280
the only difference is that when p1

2017
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,679
encapsulates the package with ipv6

2018
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:02,880
header only the active seat

2019
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,639
the active seat a3 column color 100 and

2020
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,239
the backup seat

2021
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:13,199
a4 column column 100 are filled in the

2022
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:16,480
segment list of the sih header

2023
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,560
the sl is set to the zero

2024
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,280
and the last entry is set to one

2025
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,800
the b flag is set setting to one

2026
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,880
the active seat a3 column column 100 is

2027
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,600
used as the destination address of the

2028
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,800
outer

2029
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,440
ip packet header

2030
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,320
once p3 fails the

2031
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,280
pen ultimate endpoint p2 finds out that

2032
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,760
the route to the

2033
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,040
directly connected egress node ps3 is

2034
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,480
unreachable

2035
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,760
if the b flag is setting modified the

2036
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,280
destination adjusts to the backup seat

2037
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,360
a for column 100 in sh1

2038
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,920
and send the packet to the update

2039
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,360
destination address

2040
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,639
okay

2041
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,360
that's all any questions or comments are

2042
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,000
welcomed

2043
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,239
angua please go ahead

2044
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,239
please be brief because we are running

2045
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,239
late

2046
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:31,120
okay can you hear me

2047
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:33,840
yes yes

2048
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,480
okay just a quick question

2049
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,760
what's the improved performance of this

2050
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,560
fast increase protection did you

2051
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,400
invalid with running code

2052
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,400
oh no they have

2053
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,440
so

2054
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,759
hello

2055
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,600
i'm also called

2056
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,560
and

2057
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,520
i would like to respond to you so i i

2058
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,480
think it

2059
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,719
we have already

2060
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,840
worked with uh some of our vendors

2061
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,520
uh to

2062
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,840
have a protocol

2063
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,600
prototype

2064
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,120
and it works very good

2065
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,560
the

2066
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,639
switching

2067
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,679
the protection switching performance is

2068
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,280
also very good

2069
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,760
less than 50

2070
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,280
milliseconds

2071
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,599
thanks

2072
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,120
thank you for the presentation

2073
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,199
we'll go to the next one

2074
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:44,759
oh thank you

2075
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,719
are you there

2076
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,440
hello

2077
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,400
okay yes i can hear you go ahead

2078
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,679
this topic is about srv6 midpoint

2079
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,400
protocation

2080
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,440
next page please

2081
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,360
uh you can flip through yourself

2082
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,920
bottom of your own

2083
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,239
okay

2084
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,639
smvs 6 tfa

2085
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,360
can achieve top bridge in different fast

2086
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,320
routine

2087
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,920
however it cannot cover srv6 policy and

2088
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,440
point nodes failure

2089
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,600
for smps there's already a document

2090
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,960
which can provide endpoint protocation

2091
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,520
this document introduced an srv6

2092
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,639
endpoint protocation mechanism

2093
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,679
when an sv6 endpoint fails

2094
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,560
an srv6 progressive forwarding node can

2095
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,360
replace the firing of fair endpoint

2096
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,880
to platform srv6 endpoint function

2097
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,960
first package to the next second node

2098
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,560
next i will introduce a srv6 midpoint

2099
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,000
protection

2100
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,600
mechanism

2101
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,600
secretary pass scenario

2102
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
when node t is failure

2103
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,320
nab node c performed for

2104
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,800
plugged forwarding offset the asset up

2105
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,719
to the next segment

2106
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,719
and the send packet to the next segment

2107
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,480
node yi

2108
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,960
lose pass in yellow when node d is

2109
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,120
failure because net node c isn't an s as

2110
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,040
a v6 endpoint node

2111
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,639
in this version

2112
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,679
uh

2113
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,239
we modify only and point nodes can

2114
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,320
perform process for audio

2115
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,360
so notice it can can't perform

2116
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,199
press forwarding

2117
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:04,239
after igp conscience uh node b deletes

2118
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,760
the fib to d

2119
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,040
it will check fibonace and perform the

2120
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,280
process for the action of cells cell's

2121
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,320
essay

2122
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,480
to the next segment and send packet to

2123
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,799
the necessary

2124
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,159
uh pursuit we collect feedback from

2125
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,880
chess print springboard group uh chance

2126
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,360
node platform product forwarding will

2127
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,960
modify as h which is against

2128
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,679
eight to rc

2129
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,000
zero in this version

2130
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,560
we added a restriction

2131
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,920
only as a v6 endpoint can run the middle

2132
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,080
point propagation and change

2133
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,440
chances node can do this

2134
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,080
this document

2135
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,239
has been discussed for a long time

2136
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,639
and is clear to everyone

2137
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,480
we have resolved other in my issues we

2138
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,400
have clocked variable comments from

2139
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,840
bruno and we have slowed by adding the

2140
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,760
instructions

2141
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,920
we would like to move forward this

2142
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,040
document

2143
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,280
thank you

2144
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,920
answers all

2145
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,639
any questions

2146
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:34,159
um do i have questions

2147
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:37,360
otherwise we'll bring it to the list

2148
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,520
because we are running short on time

2149
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,880
noah you want to say something quick

2150
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,679
ah okay

2151
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,080
i just wonder why this is in the rtg

2152
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,400
working group

2153
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,719
sorry i didn't hear you

2154
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,280
can't hear me now

2155
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,920
okay um can you bring the question to

2156
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,880
the list please

2157
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,840
we'll start with the next presentation

2158
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,080
thank you

2159
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,840
hello

2160
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,880
you have me

2161
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,560
hello kill me

2162
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,320
this is the thing

2163
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,520
yeah this is the phone from the mobile

2164
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,639
phone from china mobile

2165
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:09,679
uh

2166
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,639
yeah we we are talking about some some

2167
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,400
use cases for srv6 as a computing

2168
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,320
resources interconnecting

2169
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,800
protocol

2170
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,360
so background is that we have now

2171
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:27,040
nowadays we have a large large scale of

2172
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,880
collaboration between

2173
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,480
different different partners

2174
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,440
there are central cloud edge cloud and

2175
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,199
also some

2176
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,360
private cloud in custom site

2177
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,199
so

2178
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,520
hopefully some days we can see the cloud

2179
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,800
services

2180
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,960
will be uh

2181
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,320
as

2182
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,199
the same as electricity and water

2183
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,679
provided to the customers

2184
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,199
so

2185
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,600
let's let's our

2186
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,639
vision

2187
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,440
some days we can maybe we can

2188
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,520
reach that

2189
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,320
so now we want to

2190
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,840
make some

2191
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,560
use cases to clear to

2192
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,360
to everybody what we are doing and what

2193
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,440
we are doing now and

2194
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,440
what we

2195
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,639
want the network to be in the future

2196
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,800
so

2197
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,440
uh computer resources

2198
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,880
uh

2199
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,760
uh

2200
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,400
are connected by the networks uh

2201
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,400
and served to different uh

2202
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,600
workloads and uh

2203
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,199
you end users cell phone customers home

2204
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,320
users

2205
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,880
and enterprise users so

2206
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,719
it needs to be

2207
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:47,920
uh

2208
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,119
to be

2209
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,920
to to provide some differentiated and

2210
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,080
deterministic sre

2211
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,360
guaranteed capabilities

2212
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,280
so

2213
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,639
now we are at channel mobile building

2214
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,199
the network

2215
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,119
mainly for

2216
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:10,080
the all of the

2217
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,480
computing resources distributed around

2218
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,920
the china

2219
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,159
that's a new new network

2220
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,400
which is covers almost

2221
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:22,159
300 of cities in china almost

2222
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:26,320
90 of the cities in china

2223
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,920
so uh

2224
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,760
we what we want to

2225
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,159
to do is to unify

2226
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,760
the protocol of the ip network so

2227
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,360
makes a

2228
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,000
collaboration between at least between

2229
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,760
the network and

2230
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,320
the cloud

2231
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:46,960
easier

2232
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,360
that's that's that that's to simplify

2233
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,480
that

2234
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,000
networking

2235
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,199
technology and also to enhance the

2236
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,159
uh

2237
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,360
the the cross domain scheduling

2238
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,639
ability

2239
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:01,600
so

2240
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,600
the picture shows very simple

2241
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,000
architecture that is

2242
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,880
we have unified

2243
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,840
network running the we have network run

2244
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,199
unified as our base6 particles and that

2245
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,560
connects the

2246
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,400
compute computing resources and also uh

2247
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,119
the

2248
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,760
computer resources is kind of central

2249
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,960
cloud or the ad cloud even

2250
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,239
it has it can be the private

2251
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,760
cloud in the customer side

2252
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,960
now those

2253
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,480
those computing

2254
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,400
things will serve to

2255
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,800
our customer

2256
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,000
so

2257
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,159
so based on this we we have we we are

2258
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,159
have some use cases

2259
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,199
the first one is we need to provide a

2260
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,760
differentiated service to

2261
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,440
the customer

2262
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,239
the possible potential solution is to

2263
01:38:58,239 --> 01:38:59,840
just to

2264
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,560
calculate different path

2265
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,520
to

2266
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,360
for example some high bandwidth low

2267
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,440
levels example past

2268
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,639
to our to survive our customer

2269
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,040
requirements

2270
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,040
the second one is the

2271
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,159
the

2272
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,360
in case of the bandwidth utilization is

2273
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,920
goes high we need to some kind of

2274
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,719
isolation between different classes of

2275
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,119
services

2276
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:32,639
the potential solution is we we can

2277
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,480
have some kind of

2278
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,840
slice

2279
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:36,900
the slice can be

2280
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,239
[Music]

2281
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,920
just like some kind of topology

2282
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,639
uh

2283
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:45,040
serves to different kind of class of

2284
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,199
service and also can be some kind of

2285
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,639
hard slice

2286
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:49,440
that

2287
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,480
is uh

2288
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,719
have some of the resources q resources

2289
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,000
or memory resources reserved for

2290
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,760
different

2291
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,480
different slides

2292
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,520
then we need to

2293
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,440
the important thing is we need to the

2294
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,679
cross-domain

2295
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:11,119
ability which in internal mobile we have

2296
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,520
men we we have provinces

2297
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,159
uh network and also has backbone

2298
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,519
networks we need to

2299
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,400
cross understand

2300
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,400
ability

2301
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,199
the

2302
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:28,400
potential solution is to have the

2303
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,400
connection aperture attracted as the

2304
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,080
psid and

2305
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,600
open it to

2306
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,800
to the high

2307
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,800
high level of the

2308
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,840
the application the application will put

2309
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,440
all of the psn together to

2310
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,839
to to form an end-to-end connection

2311
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,840
then we have to

2312
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,800
need to consider to put the

2313
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,880
connection and the

2314
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,480
computing

2315
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,760
services

2316
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,520
together

2317
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,040
and

2318
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,000
so we can here we can use uh

2319
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,400
uh srv6 again to uh to to to do both of

2320
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,520
the

2321
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,199
connection and also

2322
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,239
if the

2323
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,080
some of the uh

2324
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:16,960
uh

2325
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,239
the the computer services like

2326
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:24,400
uh some firewalls like that they can be

2327
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,679
uh

2328
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:28,320
srv6 enable this can be

2329
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,920
put into the

2330
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,840
the ssid list

2331
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,560
then the fifth one is

2332
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,960
the the application

2333
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,080
we need to uh

2334
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,520
we need to

2335
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,760
understand the application

2336
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,679
at least we need to categorize the

2337
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,239
application

2338
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,800
to provide the different kind of the

2339
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,760
the

2340
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,960
the services

2341
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,920
and

2342
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,679
we also

2343
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:04,400
we

2344
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,080
we also need to

2345
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,440
have some

2346
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,800
operation and

2347
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,119
om

2348
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,800
capability to understand

2349
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,000
the user experience so for example here

2350
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,920
we have just to show the srv6 iom here

2351
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,159
to

2352
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:27,199
to to to to get the

2353
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:30,000
quality and also to

2354
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,400
locate the failure when it happens

2355
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,679
the

2356
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,400
uh last one uh

2357
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,719
is the srv6 overheads

2358
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:43,760
we have the we have the picture here and

2359
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,920
it shows network

2360
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,719
it has more than seven hops in end to

2361
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,280
end srv6 pass

2362
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,040
so

2363
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,639
the overhead is

2364
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,520
high here especially for some of the

2365
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,119
online meetings

2366
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,280
with average packed

2367
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:06,560
lens around the 300 bytes set so

2368
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,840
we need to consider the

2369
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,800
srv6 had a compression

2370
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,400
so that's all

2371
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,280
linda thanks

2372
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,800
um this is linda dembra from future way

2373
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,600
um so i do have questions um that you

2374
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,760
mentioned about the computing aware of

2375
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,639
the computing aware of the user and so

2376
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,679
is this related to china mobile's

2377
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,159
can the compute aware networking is a

2378
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,920
part of that initiative or it's

2379
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,239
different

2380
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,320
it's part of the networking just

2381
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,080
networking it's a it's different

2382
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,880
so you're not considering like

2383
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,080
advertising the computing resources to

2384
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,600
to the ingress that's not part of this

2385
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,400
uh that's not part of this

2386
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,679
okay thank you just to confirm

2387
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,960
yeah tony you are next

2388
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,679
thank you i'd appreciate a clarification

2389
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,440
on your problem statement

2390
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,199
we already have cloud computing that's

2391
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,679
ubiquitous today it works just fine with

2392
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,679
best effort services

2393
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,360
what is it what's the problem you're

2394
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,679
solving

2395
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,600
uh we are solving we

2396
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,679
first we need to provide different

2397
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,600
differentiated services track to our

2398
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,880
customer for example why network

2399
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
the

2400
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,520
uh because of the different

2401
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,159
uh the the you know you know the

2402
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,080
different kind of the customer have

2403
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,400
different of the uh

2404
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,519
the delay requirements

2405
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:58,239
what breaks if you use best effort

2406
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:01,040
if we are we if we if if we have the

2407
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,760
best app only have best effort then

2408
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,320
in case of the bandwidth use like just

2409
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:09,119
like this goes high then we can cannot

2410
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:14,000
provide the assured service to customers

2411
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,840
that's the problem that seems like a

2412
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,800
provisioning problem

2413
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,080
sorry

2414
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,880
that seems like a provisioning problem

2415
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,760
and your cloud doesn't have

2416
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,320
at all because you know most of the

2417
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,800
access network and also

2418
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,960
uh

2419
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,159
some of the

2420
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,360
some of the networks they are

2421
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,239
in

2422
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,800
the party of the access network and

2423
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,040
aggregation network they are

2424
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,520
some form of the tree

2425
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,679
so in case of the

2426
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:52,400
uh

2427
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
that way then

2428
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,239
there must be some kind of congestion

2429
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,839
happened in the root of the tree

2430
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,880
so if you've created a purely

2431
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,199
hierarchical topology then you have a

2432
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,719
choke point and that seems like an

2433
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,880
architectural issue

2434
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,760
but it's not possible to

2435
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,119
build a

2436
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,480
full mesh

2437
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,719
network

2438
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:20,960
is the the cost is too high

2439
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,239
it's possible before building

2440
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:26,839
distributed networks for many decades

2441
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,040
yeah so

2442
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,960
so we are what we want to solve that

2443
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,320
that problem by

2444
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,330
just using existing

2445
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,520
[Music]

2446
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,280
network architecture

2447
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,800
and provide more

2448
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,880
ability

2449
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,600
okay uh can you please continue the

2450
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,520
discussion on the list

2451
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,080
link you'll have a question please keep

2452
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,280
it short

2453
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,199
uh lingham from future week a quick

2454
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,600
question so how do you define the

2455
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,639
computer resource is it just by name or

2456
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,920
by five tuples of the

2457
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,840
address and ports

2458
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,800
thank you compute

2459
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,600
thanks

2460
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,239
computing resource can be kind of the

2461
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,400
central cloud or

2462
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,040
the edge cloud at cloud we need to

2463
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,560
connect the

2464
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,360
edge cloud and the central cloud

2465
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:25,040
together and in kind of a flexible way

2466
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,360
okay

2467
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,080
daniel you are the last one please keep

2468
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,320
it short

2469
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,560
i already get the answer from

2470
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,159
um from the questions uh linda i'm not

2471
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:44,239
but i still um

2472
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:46,560
like to strongly recommend

2473
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,639
uh the authors to consider

2474
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,440
take consider about the computer world

2475
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
network the scenario

2476
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,119
thank you

2477
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:58,599
okay thank you

2478
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,880
hello uh good morning everyone uh kenji

2479
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,400
here on

2480
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,719
behalf of all the authors i'm talking

2481
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,960
about problem and requirements of

2482
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,400
satellite constellation for internet

2483
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,320
the work has been

2484
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,880
i think has been

2485
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,199
talked

2486
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,600
yeah the world has been talked uh uh

2487
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,320
twice this is the the version three uh

2488
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,040
from some changes

2489
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,639
uh the next one

2490
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,280
uh for the this agenda well just you

2491
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,600
know for the first two a big bullet uh

2492
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,520
bullets so just to try to give some a

2493
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,280
little background about

2494
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,480
how uh significance of the uh the work

2495
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,000
uh basically the satellite the

2496
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,719
requirement and some problem statement

2497
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:18,239
there and for the uh for the third and

2498
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,400
the fourth the bullets is about what has

2499
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,239
been changed and then what will be the

2500
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:23,440
next

2501
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,599
next slide please thank you

2502
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:28,159
okay uh here just uh give the background

2503
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:31,119
about all the three gp related uh tech

2504
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:33,679
spec tech documents now the uh

2505
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,480
importance of critical for the success

2506
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,880
of us the the foundation for the work uh

2507
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,000
in the draft so the last two bullets is

2508
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,560
mentioned as essay 2 that is the 3 gbp

2509
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,080
working group

2510
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,599
those are two ongoing uh the study ids

2511
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,280
id study

2512
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,880
projects have been explored and studied

2513
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,480
in 3gb side one is the 5g you satellite

2514
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,400
as the backhoe background from the

2515
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,960
genome b toward the cornet the core

2516
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,440
network is a mobile core network and the

2517
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,440
other one is satellite as the access

2518
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,599
network so basically it's from on the

2519
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:13,119
rent side while the geno b

2520
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,080
okay here uh this one uh this is

2521
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,520
actually the new uh the change added

2522
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,520
to the version three

2523
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,320
and this is uh it's very high level uh

2524
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,400
background from thirty thousand foot uh

2525
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,639
bird wheel it's about the the satellite

2526
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,400
uh uh

2527
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,840
insertion point

2528
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,159
uh on the three gbp wireless access part

2529
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:36,880
the first the the top uh the top diagram

2530
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,719
is showing the

2531
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,440
stateline network is after the mobile

2532
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,679
access that is

2533
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,239
before the internet well the bottom part

2534
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,880
is showing the satellite is on the

2535
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,960
access side so basically from your own

2536
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,360
device and go through the satellite and

2537
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,000
then go through the mobile access

2538
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,040
so uh

2539
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,080
the next slide i'm going to uh yes yeah

2540
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,400
i'm going to explain what this means for

2541
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,199
the top left it's just like very simple

2542
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:07,119
things and then you can consider the

2543
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,360
satellite as a reflector is

2544
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,599
hanging around on the sky and give you a

2545
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,239
simple reflection

2546
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:17,199
and the the top right one is about

2547
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,599
regenerative it's a normally for large

2548
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:20,880
areas

2549
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,679
okay but in the top right it starts to

2550
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,599
in uh include the multi asl inter

2551
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:29,360
in the satellite link

2552
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:32,239
well for the bottom left is uh actually

2553
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,880
it's like the access part so you have

2554
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,239
the uh the the ginobi

2555
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:41,760
sorry you have the uh the du geno du du

2556
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,239
cu those are the the the wireless the

2557
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,719
base station part and then uh one on

2558
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,599
board like a du on board on satellite

2559
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,400
and the cu is on the ground but here

2560
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,159
there's some

2561
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:56,480
big challenge regarding some timing

2562
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,560
timing things like for the wireless you

2563
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,159
have to get some

2564
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,199
slot within some timing budget like one

2565
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:05,520
millisecond and you use some super frame

2566
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,040
those type of things

2567
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,840
to split into a different sub you know a

2568
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,280
slot so this one really

2569
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,239
pose some challenges so for the box

2570
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:17,920
trial the bottom right

2571
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,920
the thing is well for all the three

2572
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,480
bullets here the middle one is important

2573
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,239
just to say okay you know for all the

2574
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,719
work here uh it's critical

2575
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,760
for the three gpp it has

2576
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,520
it has the

2577
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,520
setups the projects

2578
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,639
and then the 5g commercial deployment is

2579
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,560
there i think it's close two million

2580
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,880
five g base stations already lots of

2581
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,280
applications and then satellite is

2582
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,719
important so

2583
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:47,199
in order to do that the cellular network

2584
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:49,119
is the you know um

2585
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:51,119
some standardize the work need to be

2586
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:52,800
done

2587
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,080
next one

2588
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,639
yeah here it's on the on the layer three

2589
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,480
just to show okay well you know if you

2590
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:02,400
consider a satellite as a node uh hiding

2591
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,199
around on the sky and then how the igp

2592
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,520
potential eb gp ibtp those type of

2593
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,599
things uh will be

2594
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:11,040
pairing together

2595
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,320
so uh for the work that has been um has

2596
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,520
been attacked in previous ietf one i

2597
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,800
think one two

2598
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,080
uh i forget uh so previous to talk about

2599
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,719
the how extreme dynamics in the red font

2600
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,679
throughout the bottom left about all the

2601
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:30,320
link quality cost all kinds of things

2602
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,679
and the igp btp mutual advertisement so

2603
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:35,679
here is really uh the challenging part

2604
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:37,599
for the layer three especially for the

2605
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:40,480
leo the low earth obviously like this

2606
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,959
network

2607
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,080
okay

2608
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:47,119
now uh back to the uh the draft here or

2609
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,920
this draft is the the third version of

2610
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,639
the second the bullet in the top box

2611
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,639
that's actually the first bullet in the

2612
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,920
top box is the red font and then this is

2613
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,639
one of a series of ids on the seller

2614
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,440
networks the the things have been

2615
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,000
discussed in previous ideas

2616
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,400
uh can we after i'm done

2617
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,159
i have a clarification question on the

2618
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:13,598
last slide it's really brief

2619
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,960
this is dino um

2620
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,560
so it kind of makes sense that from

2621
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,280
ground to space you're using ebgp

2622
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,360
but it looks like um you're using one

2623
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,199
single igp for the entire satellite

2624
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,280
network is that suppose

2625
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,199
was your intention for it to be a single

2626
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:30,880
aes or multiple layout this is just a

2627
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,639
conceptual i'm not showing okay i can

2628
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,960
only use one single on mate those type

2629
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,560
of things there's concepts that wasn't

2630
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,560
implying one aff yeah these conceptual

2631
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,400
things yes

2632
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,480
actually i can answer that that that

2633
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,560
slice doesn't mean that we will use that

2634
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,520
means that like traditional technology

2635
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,520
looks like we have to configure bgp

2636
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,159
somewhere either from the ground to a

2637
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:54,159
seller link or somewhere else to

2638
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:55,760
interworking with

2639
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,800
internet that's why there's a problem

2640
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,440
okay by the way link is the chief editor

2641
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:05,119
of the draft so

2642
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:08,320
yeah here is the uh the bunch of the ids

2643
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,119
okay and here these are two uh cases for

2644
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,520
uh from the 3gbp that means it's the

2645
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,719
real thing that being started it's so

2646
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,280
far is in the stage two after the sit

2647
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,440
down after stage two going to trick down

2648
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,599
uh to stage three and then about the you

2649
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,360
know all the kind of communication

2650
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,800
protocols all kind of thing will be

2651
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,360
involved

2652
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:32,000
the next one here yeah well this is a

2653
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,560
case to show you know the leo with marty

2654
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,360
sl as a 5g backhoe and then you know

2655
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,360
it's well basically just say suppose you

2656
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,159
have a two ues uh who anchor on

2657
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:44,560
different ups and then when they want to

2658
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,280
talk to each other over a session not

2659
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,440
spend more than five minutes and because

2660
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,320
of the extreme dynamics of the uh

2661
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:56,000
of the satellite it will cause some uh i

2662
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,040
will see very significant challenge

2663
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,400
to the things so for and also you know

2664
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,920
for the uh this one will include the qf

2665
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,440
of qs flow since uh for the 3gb each ue

2666
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,760
will have a pdu session and then qs

2667
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,880
flows all kind of symbols involved so if

2668
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,560
you consider things together like

2669
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,719
suppose from ue1 to ue2 it's going

2670
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:20,719
through the layer 3 so you're going to

2671
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,400
involve the routing the extremely

2672
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,560
dynamic routing protocols locking

2673
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,080
algorithms with the qs inside and also

2674
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,159
the 3gpp case are talking about

2675
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,080
monitoring you have to get some feedback

2676
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,239
from the network in order to adjust or

2677
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,560
improve it so when you put everything

2678
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,280
together so this is a very important

2679
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,840
critical to justify why a cellular

2680
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,080
network is important and

2681
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,199
it it has its some position uh in ietf

2682
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:50,239
to to do some sdo work and then the the

2683
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,400
second bullet on the bottom box just to

2684
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,639
show you know dynamic does not mean

2685
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,040
anything about the render so actually

2686
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,599
you know the the track of a satellite

2687
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,239
actually has some predefined tracks so

2688
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:05,199
you may or we may be able to uh

2689
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:08,000
utilize those information in order to do

2690
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,840
the mechanical work

2691
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,040
yeah that's it

2692
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,719
yeah so this is just a conclusion about

2693
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:17,360
the other things and then uh you know we

2694
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,440
have a you know this is our time and

2695
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,760
then we hope you know by the way there

2696
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,719
will be asa meeting in next uh in uk

2697
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,560
london for itv105 and we do welcome

2698
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,760
out comments contributions and you know

2699
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,040
all kind of

2700
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:36,080
feedback we believe is important and the

2701
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,560
real case is there through gpp are

2702
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,840
working on it

2703
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:43,440
are pushing it okay thank you

2704
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,080
do you know

2705
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,520
yes this is dino with respect to the

2706
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,000
instructive routing draft

2707
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,679
do you guys from all the research you've

2708
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:54,960
done so far

2709
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,719
have you um

2710
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:59,679
do you believe or have an opinion if gps

2711
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:00,960
based routing will be done on the

2712
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,719
satellite network okay um

2713
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,360
actually that's just

2714
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,239
one solution we've given but uh we we

2715
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,080
know that there are many research topics

2716
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:17,840
for this regard so i i think we welcome

2717
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,840
other people also contribute different

2718
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,239
solutions because that's another easy

2719
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:25,040
routing problem

2720
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,159
thank you

2721
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:32,000
so based on that answer do you think

2722
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,320
you're going to have to inner work

2723
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:37,840
between these different solutions

2724
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,679
you mean you're into working with

2725
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:43,920
with with a different network

2726
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,040
with the internet of course you have to

2727
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,639
if you have multiple addressing

2728
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,719
solutions on the satellite network will

2729
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:52,880
the satellite network systems have to

2730
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,280
interwork with each other in in leo

2731
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,320
right now we don't we don't expect there

2732
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,960
will be a uh interworking between

2733
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,599
different satellite network but one

2734
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,080
satellite network has to

2735
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,920
exchange internet laws with internet

2736
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,320
yes it's different now yeah okay so

2737
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,000
to summarize that answer you're going to

2738
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,920
say each satellite network that has a

2739
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,440
different addressing scheme will look

2740
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,360
like just a different type of layer 2

2741
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,239
link

2742
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:26,560
and to make them work it's no different

2743
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,360
than

2744
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,040
ethernet

2745
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,520
or fddi to talk about the past links and

2746
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,719
you just l3 over it

2747
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,199
yes that's what we can see right now

2748
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:38,960
because we cannot force a different

2749
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,920
vendor to use the one technology but

2750
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,719
bottom line is that satellite network

2751
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:47,920
has to be ip compatible because

2752
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,639
in 3g pp point wheels they will treat

2753
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:55,520
every sunlight network as a ip node

2754
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,840
yeah so there's obvious disadvantages of

2755
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,960
that because that means there's going to

2756
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,040
be a lot of ground to satellite

2757
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,440
delay

2758
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,080
um

2759
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:09,520
so we only have one minute for the

2760
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,480
second to the last presenter

2761
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,199
we apologize to the last presentation we

2762
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,440
won't be able to get to it we'll have an

2763
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:20,638
interim to cover that

2764
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,639
should i please go ahead

2765
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:26,800
yes thanks i will give a

2766
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,000
quick break and um uh we

2767
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,199
i will present the two use cases and in

2768
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:36,960
kerala networks the operators may

2769
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,719
change the page

2770
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:41,840
yes um

2771
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,760
operators may deploy multiple data

2772
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:47,280
centers or computing resource pools um

2773
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:50,480
distributed lift dataset centers can has

2774
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,440
a different types of value added service

2775
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:56,800
from the perspective of an operator we

2776
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,199
need to think how to provide about

2777
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:01,920
better services in addition to the cost

2778
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,920
of land tendency of network process

2779
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:06,480
between the data centers whether

2780
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:09,040
computing resource should be considered

2781
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:12,560
and how to measure a computing resource

2782
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,199
uh the number of virtual

2783
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:18,480
cpu or cpu utilization memory

2784
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,679
utilization or other parameters and what

2785
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,920
the technology is used to achieve

2786
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,119
computing of our function and

2787
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,480
i will talk about the two use cases why

2788
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,480
is the computing of our

2789
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,960
sd1 and the other is computing overall

2790
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,840
sfc

2791
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,480
yes if sd1 can be aware of the computing

2792
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:43,599
resource

2793
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:46,639
of a application deployed in the cloud

2794
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:50,159
by virtual cpes and selected application

2795
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:52,400
instance for the client to visit

2796
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,960
according to the computing power and the

2797
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,440
network state of one as shown in the

2798
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:00,480
page on cloud 1 and cloud 2 visiting

2799
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,520
application 1 in cloud 1 if the load of

2800
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:06,000
application in cloud 1 is

2801
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,599
50 and the load of application in cloud

2802
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:11,360
2 is 20

2803
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,400
and the same network stage how about

2804
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:18,639
calendar 3 and we think to consider

2805
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:22,080
let's say loaded the application sd1 uh

2806
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,119
selects a application uh one in cloud

2807
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:27,679
two for the calendar three uh in branch

2808
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:31,599
office uh so the path is shown in the

2809
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:33,199
in the page

2810
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:36,960
and the other case uh use cases is about

2811
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:40,400
uh computing aware uh sfc

2812
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,560
yes we can see uh

2813
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,639
each data center may have different

2814
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:47,280
types of service functions

2815
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,119
high usage service functions are

2816
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,199
deployed in edge or regional data

2817
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,760
centers well other low usage service

2818
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:57,360
functions are deployed in global also to

2819
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:00,719
central data centers so sfcs with

2820
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,880
different types of service functions may

2821
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,400
span multiple

2822
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,840
data centers

2823
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,040
and when we consider the process

2824
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,520
computation of srp

2825
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,560
according to the cost of all lanterns of

2826
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,199
a network process between the data

2827
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:19,760
centers house hosting the service

2828
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:22,480
functions nowadays in order to get the

2829
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,960
good service experience of service

2830
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,599
functions and the optimal end-to-end

2831
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,119
network parts

2832
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:31,520
the computing load of search functions

2833
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,599
should also be considered

2834
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:35,840
as shown in the page

2835
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:39,280
a user orders out other

2836
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,679
sfc with a chain of two

2837
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:43,199
valued

2838
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,440
added services for its access to

2839
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,440
internet service

2840
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:48,480
the

2841
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:51,920
the services secretaries of the fcc as a

2842
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,520
to assess

2843
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,760
farewell and the

2844
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,440
vo uh which dc is better to provide as a

2845
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,280
function fair walk

2846
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,480
to consider the lately loaded service

2847
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,520
functions uh computing as slp as a

2848
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,440
repair center as

2849
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,719
in the page

2850
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,320
and we have

2851
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,840
mentioned the procedure for sfp

2852
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,239
creation in the draft

2853
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:19,679
and

2854
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:22,480
we also to give the

2855
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,360
potential solutions could be considered

2856
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:28,000
maybe to collect the service functions

2857
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,840
location and computing power by bgp ls

2858
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,280
or net

2859
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,840
config from the router connecting the

2860
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,679
data centers and

2861
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,360
dynamical get

2862
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,400
get the association relationship and the

2863
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,960
independent collector's function

2864
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,199
location and the computing power by

2865
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:50,880
other means and statically configure the

2866
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,199
association with the network on the

2867
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:54,560
control plane

2868
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:55,360
