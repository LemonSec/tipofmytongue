16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,079
hand is one way of expressing it and for

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
this meeting

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,559
mask is required in the meeting room

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,280
with that

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
we have a a reasonably full agenda today

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,400
there there's a lot of stuff to cover

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
um

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
we do need a couple of note takers we

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
need a

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
well a normal note taker and if if

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,119
possible somebody to go watch tulip and

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,400
and channel

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
any discussions to the mic that can't be

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
anyone who can't sort of be um you know

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
either remote or

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,799
using voice remote or in person so

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
we get some volunteers to um

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,559
um

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
all right so

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
valerie is taking care of zulu but we do

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,240
do need a notetaker

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
oh perfect man thank you so ben schwartz

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,759

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
take notes this is um this is really

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
good

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
all right

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
with that

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
um

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,240
here's our agenda today um

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,119
we

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,320
are going to start with rich

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
we're going to talk to us about the ip

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,840
address

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,318
issue um and then honda's to talk about

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
iot and i see hannah's here already joe

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,959
i haven't seen i haven't seen joe online

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
oh there you are perfect

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
right

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
so we actually have everybody here that

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
needs them here so rich do you want to

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,080
want to get going i'm going to

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,599
see if do you want to do this or should

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,640
i okay let me

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,599
all right

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
let's see if i can

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
make this work

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
there we go okay

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
uh hi i'm going to leave after my

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
session not because my ego is so big but

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,480
because

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,238
there's a conflict okay next slide

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
all right so

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
uh like two weeks ago

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
three weeks ago martin thompson proposed

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
that we add support for ip addresses

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
there is

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
um

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,720
the subject alt name

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,920
extension in pcx has a type for ip

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
addresses

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,959
the obvious thing to call it is ip-id

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
similar to dnsid and the other

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,360
terminology used in 6125 and 61-25 bis

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,840
rfc 9110 which was presumably martin's

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,599
for bringing it up has text about

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
validation the rule is very simple

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
a reference id matches if the ip address

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,599
matches

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
fairly straightforward

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
it's not uncommon in http

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
um if you've ever typed you know

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,799
http

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,760
colon slash 127001

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
you've done it

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
um presumably there's more mechanisms

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,319
that are going to come

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,720
http alternate service and some of the

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,239
other mechanisms that are being added to

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,680
http

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
are more likely to include more of these

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
kinds of things

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
and there may even be other uses outside

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,119
of http i don't know

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
next slide

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
okay so the issues uh it is admittedly

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
late martin said so in his comment um it

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,439
might make the draft more widely

103
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,080
applicable i don't know i i

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
i'll take him it was had his word

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
uh the simple wording change does have

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
ripple effects through the document

107
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,238
um

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,680
for example

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
in the front

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
near the front of the dock

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
it says here's the rules

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
and then you have to add like an escape

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
patch for step three that says but if

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
it's an ip address do this

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
it's just editorial where it's missing

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
um so the goal is we should want to seek

117
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,440
working group consensus whether or not

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
to do this

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,199
it wasn't clear if there was consensus

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
chairs thought there was i thought there

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
was no we're not quite right

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
there's an initial pr i reopened the pr

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
on the issue it's on github

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,400
so the pr is by martin initial

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
admittedly incomplete

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,919
the issue about doing it is there

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
not in the bullet list

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,639
but probably worth noting

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,440
is

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,479
uh

131
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
i'm going to be kind of busy with

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
nom-com for the next five months

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,919
so

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
but i have a co-author

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
a little bit busy

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
i'm just gonna pick all the old uh

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
incumbents and do them again anyhow

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,799
uh next next slide

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,880
so the current text

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
in the out of scope section which this

141
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
obviously would go away

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
is identifiers such as ip addresses are

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
not discussed

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
protocols other than http may want to

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,039
consider and then points to 9001. not

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
whatever 9000 something

147
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,639
as a validation model

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,160
um

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
i think that's reasonable description of

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
the issues

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,639
uh

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
looking for you know

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
what the working group wants to do

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
so with my chair hat how much is this

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
gonna screw us over in terms of time

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,240
uh timeline

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,759
you know i'm complaining it's probably

158
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,520
not a lot of work to do all the

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,479
wordsmithing necessary okay um so it's

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
more like a it's your availability

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
that's really sort of yeah and even then

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
i'm still just complaining so it's

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
probably not going to add much elapsed

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
time we could probably still be done

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
before the next ietf so you're comparing

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
a little bit but not too much i'm

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
complaining a little bit not too much

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,080
peter andre is also available all right

169
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
so yeah

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
um alessandro gadini cloudflare uh we do

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
have you know use cases for um

172
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
https and other

173
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
secure tls connections to um ip

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,600
addresses specifically

175
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
for example the cloudflare resolver with

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,440
the

177
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,960
1.1.1.1 address

178
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
so ideally

179
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,039
i would want to see this supported

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
i can help with you know review prs and

181
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
whatnot

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
yeah um

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
martin thompson

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
out of the queue now um

185
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
i put that that pull request together

186
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,000
and i do sort of appreciate where you're

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
coming from rich after having tried that

188
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
it is a little bit more work than simply

189
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
just adding sort of one bullet point and

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,720
removing the we don't do ips from the

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,520
from the front matter

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
it's not my document so i don't i wasn't

193
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
able to identify everything i don't

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
think very confidently

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
but um i think probably the most

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,039
interesting

197
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
aspect of this

198
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,720
uh the section that talks about

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
which one was it the

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
sans or

201
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,199
like not sans the srv or something yeah

202
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,759
this is about service identifiers right

203
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
sip colon foo sip s colon foo dot bar

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
yeah example yeah and some of that was a

205
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,879
little fiddly but

206
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
other than that the changes are pretty

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
straightforward that what you would

208
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
imagine

209
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,960
goes in here

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,639
so hopefully what i've got there would

211
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
be enough to get you

212
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
ninety percent of the way

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
unfortunately the last ten percent is

214
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
always the hardest part

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
i'm kind of asking you to do it yeah uh

216
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759
to some extent

217
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,800
http already has it

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
has what it needs but i don't think the

219
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,399
text in

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,279
um

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,958
rfc 9110 is particularly good

222
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
now that i've looked at it again

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
i'm sort of looking at it going oh

224
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,919
that's

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,200
gee we could have done a better job with

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
that and

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
and this document here is is that much

228
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,839
better job okay so i

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
like

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
like others i think

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
i think the worth work is worth doing

232
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,120
even if it means one more cycle

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,920
uh

234
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
and a little bit of complication i'm

235
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
happy to help i'm i tried to help but uh

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
that's about the extent of my ability

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,839
i'm afraid

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,279
because yeah you know the document

239
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
better than i do sure yeah i don't want

240
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
to overstate

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
i don't want to sound like a grumpy old

242
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
man so i don't want to overstate my

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
concerns about it i'm really whatever

244
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
the working group wants is fine you know

245
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
um i should also mention we're about to

246
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
submit a draft that shows how to use ip

247
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,320
addresses in sni fields

248
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
so oh yeah that'll be a fun conversation

249
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
dot dot inaudible

250
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,839
so all right so um

251
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,080
quick sense of the room um

252
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
and i'll i'll use the hand raising tool

253
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
if people really want me to but

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,279
otherwise i'll just sort of do it this

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,720
way um

256
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,200
in this room

257
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,839
sorry

258
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
a message from alexey melindikov

259
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
in the chat

260
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
so he thinks that

261
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
this problem should be addressed but not

262
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
in this document

263
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
alexa is right behind you in the quran

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,920
go ahead alexa

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
alexa do you want to make a case for a

266
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,160
separate document

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
yeah hello

268
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,720
sorry um

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
i think the properties are slightly

270
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
different so it would be nice probably

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
i think it would be better to have a

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,279
separate document for this just to keep

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
it clean

274
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,959
so are you volunteering to write one

275
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,279
i don't mind helping out yes

276
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
can you repeat that

277
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
he didn't mind helping yes don't mind

278
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
helping yeah because so i i would

279
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,720
actually want don't want the working

280
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
group to block on this right so if we we

281
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
want to sort of

282
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
either proceed with like a a clear

283
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
commitment from authors to to kind of

284
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
come back with a

285
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
separate document or

286
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,680
um

287
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,160
like we proceed with this pr or we

288
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
decide that this is not work worth

289
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
working on at all

290
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
um so i don't want us to hang in limbo

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,720
here so

292
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
um

293
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,479
martin you wanna

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
yeah i wanna ask alexi why um because i

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,040
think the y is more important here at

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
this point

297
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,920
than just saying

298
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
this one or the other one

299
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
alexi

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,959
well

301
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,560
i think uh

302
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
your comments about

303
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
certain things wouldn't apply to be

304
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
addresses it just made me concerned

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,680
and

306
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
if it doesn't fit quite right you know

307
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,480
just make it a separate document

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,399
so i believe the working group should

309
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
probably separately ask

310
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
whether we should work up on this and

311
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
how it's done

312
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
so i i would i have you looked at the

313
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
changes that i proposed

314
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,720
i haven't quite caught up with

315
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,440
this but um

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
yeah so the reason that i think

317
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
this document is a better place for that

318
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
aside from having everything in one

319
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,079
place is a nice

320
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
and one-stop shop for people who are

321
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,839
looking to reference these things

322
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
is that there are some interactions with

323
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
the existing things and that was the

324
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
complicated part of getting the work

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
done it's not super complicated or

326
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,399
anything

327
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
but having an extra document that comes

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,600
in and surgically amends the the various

329
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
pieces of of an existing document

330
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
to to put ip addresses in there

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
is somewhat more complicated

332
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,560
than um

333
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,880
and then i think getting it done here

334
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
now that the patient's open

335
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
so

336
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
that's where i ended up once i did the

337
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,279
work that's all

338
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
okay yeah my coverage is i haven't uh

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,360
reviewed your pr yet so maybe

340
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
i can commit to doing it within next few

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
days or something like that

342
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
all right does anybody feel strongly

343
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,199
against um progressing with um pr54

344
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,839
what was it

345
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,360
strongly against progressing with what

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
progressing with pr-54 you're important

347
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,639
oh

348
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
if alexi can get his document done and

349
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
it's i mean you know i've sort of come

350
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,839
around to martin's viewpoint

351
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
right

352
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
victor

353
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
hi um are there

354
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
name constraint issues that perhaps

355
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,040
would add some complexity for ipid

356
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,760
do we have a specification for

357
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,079
ipid name constraint processing and also

358
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,600
does that live here or would that be

359
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
5280 and

360
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
refinements

361
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
so the doc right now talks not at all

362
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
about name constraints which i think are

363
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
kind of horked anyway right

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
um so presumably would be

365
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
50 20 50 to 80 bis which is never going

366
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,440
to happen

367
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,720
so yeah i mean

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
no they're probably i don't know if

369
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,040
there are anything

370
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,399
there's nothing workable about name

371
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,399
constraints for ip addresses that that i

372
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,720
can recall but that i may be wrong

373
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,199
so so the answer there is that there are

374
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
no names name constraints defined for ip

375
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,800
addresses nor do i expect there to ever

376
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
be given

377
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,079
rich's point about 5280 uh being set in

378
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,839
stone in a way that i think

379
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,199
is probably not a bad thing entirely

380
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
maybe you know if

381
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
alexi wants to do his draft

382
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
and thinks he can get it done in the

383
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
short term then we can maybe decide but

384
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
on the other hand i'm willing to

385
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,199
if the working group wants to do it i'm

386
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,160
willing to do it i just don't promise

387
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,279
anything

388
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,440
before 115 maybe a month before

389
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
i mean i've heard people stand up and

390
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
say that they volunteer to work on it

391
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
which is a good thing right so it's an

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
indication we can get it done yeah so i

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
was going to suggest that now let's not

394
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
expect rich to do

395
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,560
all of the work

396
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
i think peter was interested in spending

397
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
a little bit of time on this one the the

398
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
editors can collab if they want to ask

399
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
me to do something i'm willing to do

400
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,279
that

401
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
uh if alexi reaches a different

402
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,519
conclusion and wants to propose an

403
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
alternative way once he's had a look at

404
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,120
it if anyone else wants to do the same

405
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,160
we can do that but um

406
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,519
that's okay

407
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
i think at this point i'd propose we

408
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
leave it with the editors

409
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
to sort through what's there

410
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,600
and um if we get more feedback about it

411
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,440
from people who have committed to review

412
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,160
then we'll we'll discuss that all right

413
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
that's i think i think that's an

414
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
excellent idea all right let's just

415
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
let's do that and then continue this

416
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
confirm on the list

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,440
okay

418
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
all right and please people who have

419
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
stood up and said that they wanna um

420
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
um

421
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
that they are volunteering to review the

422
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
current pull request or you know

423
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
contribute other material let's try to

424
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
get that done as quickly as possible so

425
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
we can get the ball rolling yeah um one

426
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
thing i'll mention is if you haven't

427
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
please read the current draft because i

428
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,800
think it's

429
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,079
maybe i have an inflated opinion to

430
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,000
myself but it's pretty clear and simple

431
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,759
about how to do things which is

432
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
important i think for the community and

433
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
so then when we do add ip addresses we

434
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
want to make sure that we don't lose

435
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
that clarity and simplicity more than we

436
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
have to

437
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
okay i've got somebody at the queue is

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
eric i think you want to talk about name

439
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,320
constraints so maybe

440
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
yeah just briefly i looked yesterday

441
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,799
5280 and it does define name constraints

442
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
for ip addresses they're like other gaps

443
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
with search and ip address that we

444
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,000
someday will want to deal with um what

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
name constraints at least does seem to

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,760
be intuitive

447
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
anyway but as somebody as i think you

448
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
pointed out name constraints is a bigger

449
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
ratio it's not covered at all right now

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
yeah

451
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,280
okay all right thank you that's it for

452
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
for um

453
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,679
your slots let's see here next on our

454
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
agenda

455
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,639
iot profile on this

456
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,200
okay

457
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
so

458
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
i would like to talk about the update we

459
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
made with o5 first i want to go through

460
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
some of the changes that were made and

461
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
then to point to a couple of the open

462
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
issues

463
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
of which there are a number of them in

464
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
the github repository of the working

465
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,160
group

466
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,640
next slide

467
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
okay

468
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
so the first one is

469
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,440
so as you know in dls1.3 to use the

470
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,400
serial rtd feature you have to come up

471
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
with an application specific profile to

472
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
describe how

473
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
you deal with um

474
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
sort of the needed uh replay protection

475
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,120
and so in an earlier document we

476
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,480
uh added that feature and also did

477
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,360
um

478
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,000
sort of discuss this and and announce it

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
on the co-op list where it was actually

480
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,880
uh

481
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
debated and it turned out that the

482
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,760
co-working group right now doesn't see

483
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
interest in or need for the serial rtd

484
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
feature in dls for some of their uses

485
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,480
so

486
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
um

487
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
with that in mind we decided to

488
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
take it out from this document actually

489
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
park it into a separate specification

490
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,280
that maybe just temporarily as or people

491
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
are just happy with the way dls is

492
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
because there are obviously some ups and

493
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,080
downs of using the zero rtd feature uh

494
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,200
so

495
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
um that's where we are today at least uh

496
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
so it's not

497
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
like not gone forever but

498
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
at least for now so

499
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
that um

500
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
makes the document shorter so that's a

501
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,559
plus because there's a you need to

502
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
define a couple of um

503
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
additional co-op

504
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
uh options

505
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
to make that feature work

506
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,280
okay

507
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
the other one which is a little bit more

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,440
tricky is um the recommendation on the

509
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
um

510
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,880
the domestic ecdsa which we sort of took

511
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
over from

512
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
uh the previous uh

513
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
dls and dtls 1.2 iot recommendations as

514
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
well as from what the the dls1.3

515
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
specification says

516
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
so the recommendation there is

517
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
to use deterministic ecdsa

518
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,440
and

519
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,559
but then

520
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
it seems that the

521
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
sort of focus or the excitement has uh

522
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,640
changed again

523
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
in terms of that feature and there are

524
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
obviously currently discussion in cfrc

525
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,039
on

526
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,919
um adding the

527
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
noise or randomness back into

528
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
the ecdsa function as i will as you will

529
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
see on the next slide but uh

530
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,840
the point here is that

531
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,039
there are

532
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,520
attacks and specifically exploiting the

533
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,919
weakness that the uh

534
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,679
that random number generation is of

535
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
course a challenging topic on

536
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
iot devices and non-iot devices

537
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
specifically if you have access to those

538
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
devices and you can mount fault

539
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
injection attacks

540
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
um of course iot devices are often

541
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,679
you or the attacker often has physical

542
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
access so those attacks would be

543
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,559
applicable and even though we see a

544
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
increase in

545
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,799
sort of hardware based features for

546
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
security including random number

547
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
generation there is um at least the

548
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,520
perception

549
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,320
that

550
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
those are not as good as they they could

551
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
be uh which i don't want to quantify

552
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,039
because it's uh obviously depends on

553
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
from product or

554
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
i'm sure that the features vary from

555
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
product to product so i don't want to

556
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
make a general statement but at least

557
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,679
if you look at those attacks there are

558
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,760
cases where devices have had um

559
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,480
limited uh randomness in

560
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
and obviously that when applied to

561
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
uh some of the our protocols and also

562
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
the

563
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
the

564
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
the signature mechanisms that causes

565
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
problems

566
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
what i personally on next slide um

567
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,000
i struggle then with is to actually make

568
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
good recommendations because uh

569
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,799
even a protocol like dls uh there's so

570
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,880
we need sources of randomness in various

571
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,080
places and for example not just with

572
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
ecdsa but also with the ephemera

573
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,120
different helmet or with the um

574
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
with the randomness that is sent around

575
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,559
in a clientele sub-hello exchange but

576
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,200
in my belief um if you don't have any

577
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,919
randomness then you are set yourself up

578
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,280
for problems

579
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,000
but

580
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
what should the recommendations be in

581
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
that case and so uh thomas who is also

582
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
working on the generic utah dls 1.3

583
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
recommendation document which is

584
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
sort of separate

585
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
from the iud recommendation there

586
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
obviously there are some recommendations

587
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
being made which are now

588
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,360
sort of carried over to into this

589
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
document

590
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
so it's easy to write those document

591
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
those recommendations in some sense it's

592
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,520
another story to actually ex uh

593
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,159
implement them in in real

594
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
hardware and real software on iot

595
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
devices but

596
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
i think that's that's as much as as we

597
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,280
can do

598
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
at this point in time

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,039
okay

600
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,919
um

601
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,240
thank you thanks to michael richardson

602
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
uh i don't see him right now in the room

603
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,679
but he has done a very detailed review

604
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,760
in response to a presentation i gave at

605
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
the iot ops meeting

606
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
at the last idf

607
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
and

608
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
this is one

609
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
that we addressed already it's one that

610
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
concerns the use of intermediate ca

611
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,200
versus subordinate ca which we were a

612
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
little bit relaxed on on using the

613
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
terminology from rc 49

614
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,200
49 so we addressed that one

615
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,559
um

616
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
as you will see later he had a couple of

617
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
other reviews which we addressed already

618
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,320
but he didn't indicate whether he is

619
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,360
happy with them so we didn't um

620
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
incorporate them into the documentary

621
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
waiting for his uh final assessment

622
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
before we are going to do that

623
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
next slide

624
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,039
okay

625
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
so a few

626
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
um open issues one is um

627
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,840
what we call the feature

628
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,960
disparity uh is

629
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
and that was also discussed on the tls

630
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
mailing list not just on the utah list

631
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,520
is with certain features that were

632
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
they are different between uh 1.2 and

633
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,960
1.3 which are kind of subtle

634
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
for example

635
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
on the slide this concerns the

636
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
renegotiation which apparently some

637
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
people used in dls 1.2

638
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,120
to

639
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,440
[Music]

640
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
check

641
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,679
the certificate status at a later stage

642
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,559
so the for long-lived tls connections

643
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
they are apparently

644
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
uh which are which are used in

645
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
industrial iot networks

646
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
they

647
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
use that technique to find out whether

648
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
the certificate is still

649
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,760
valid using for example

650
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
ocsb

651
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,279
extensions carried inside that exchange

652
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,799
or just

653
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,919
triggering a certificate

654
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,640
checking again

655
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
um we went through the discussions on

656
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,799
the dls list and tried to capture some

657
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,600
of it in this issue that is linked here

658
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,200
uh but it's not so easy to

659
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
to really make a

660
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
recommendation on

661
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
what to do about some of those different

662
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
features clearly renegotiation is done

663
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,159
is is gone but should it should there be

664
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,240
some some extensions being added back to

665
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
dls um to enable some of those features

666
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,080
or is the solution that has been used um

667
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
actually not the right approach to begin

668
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
with and that's uh specifically on that

669
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
front the long-lived dls connections and

670
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,760
using that the renegotiation feature to

671
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
check the status of certificates is that

672
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,640
actually

673
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,799
the best way to do i'm not sure in

674
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,080
either case

675
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
um the dls extension is not something

676
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,200
that we can incorporate or new extension

677
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
incorporate into this

678
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
uh document anyway

679
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
and for the other one it's even if we

680
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
make that recommendation ah the

681
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
those who relied on that feature

682
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,279
previously are going to change their

683
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,080
code to to make use of it um not

684
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,000
entirely certain

685
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
martin

686
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
yeah honest have you um

687
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
considered the use of the exported

688
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,279
authenticators for this purpose

689
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,080
actually no how would that work

690
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
so it would require something at the

691
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
application layer that you would

692
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
essentially have

693
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
one side uh challenge the other other

694
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
side to

695
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,039
to present an

696
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,080
exported authenticator and you would

697
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,120
that other side would then produce

698
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
what is effectively a certificate and a

699
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
signature using that

700
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,919
certificate over something exported from

701
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,200
the um

702
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
various secrets

703
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
and that would allow you to refresh

704
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
your view of the currency of the

705
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
certificate that was used on the

706
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
connection maybe you don't need to

707
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
provide a certificate you just provide

708
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,720
the

709
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440
authenticator but okay

710
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
that's recently that's a that's a uh

711
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
interesting approach i don't think that

712
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
was actually proposed on the list i went

713
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
uh through the discussions and didn't

714
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
don't think i saw that one uh it's

715
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
probably worthwhile to explore but uh

716
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,480
it was uh uh stephen fries from siemens

717
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
who brought this up because uh he is

718
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,159
working deeply on his industrial

719
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,919
iot use cases

720
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,559
and so uh i will definitely double check

721
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,679
things yeah there's a number of things

722
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
you can do

723
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,279
that might help so the the re-keying

724
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,440
that happens the key updates

725
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
allow you to refresh keys and give you

726
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,799
some degree

727
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,440
of post compromise security but um

728
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,799
this would allow you to

729
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,880
refresh the credentials what you don't

730
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
get is fresh entropy for the session so

731
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,559
you don't get the ability to do another

732
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
dippy helmet for instance that may

733
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
actually be a feature

734
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,720
from the iot perspective i don't know

735
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,279
um so um

736
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
yeah discuss it i don't know what the

737
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
what the right answer is yeah there's

738
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
probably a um

739
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,919
it probably what we would need is um

740
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,679
almost like a um

741
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,440
problem statement with assumptions to

742
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
find out like what specific attacks do

743
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,320
we care about and and do we care about

744
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,799
like uh like what keys are we

745
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
expecting to double check whether they

746
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
are compromised is it a long-term key is

747
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,320
it something

748
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
like if we do a key update for example

749
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,240
clearly we wouldn't recognize whether

750
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,200
the the certificates used in a mutual

751
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
dls exchange have been compromised and

752
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,080
and so on and so on and uh

753
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
so so maybe maybe that's uh sounds like

754
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
a good idea to actually use that um

755
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,600
example as uh as a trigger to debate

756
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,159
what exactly the requirements are yeah i

757
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,679
think that's a good way to go about it

758
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,200
yeah yeah i like that

759
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
one more person in the queue behind

760
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
martin

761
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
i'm assuming about this yeah stef

762
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,039
actually cool hey stefan

763
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
hi hannes good to see you uh yeah just

764
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,000
to shed some light on the requirements

765
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,760
so uh the requirement goes back to to uh

766
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,000
one of the tls usages that we have in

767
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,960
power system automation and uh there it

768
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
is a way that currently we used in the

769
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,640
renegotiation feature in tls 1.2

770
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
to trigger the certificate as a

771
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,520
certificate revocation check as hannah's

772
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
mentioned and while switching over to

773
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
tls version 1.3 we would basically

774
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
offload

775
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,200
that

776
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
functionality to the application itself

777
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
because there is no no

778
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
trigger coming from the tls stack

779
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
because renegotiation is no longer

780
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,279
allowed in tls version 1.3 so that means

781
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,120
that we

782
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,200
basically have some kind of timer in the

783
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
application and once the timer is up the

784
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,559
certificate gets rechecked

785
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,799
uh we can do the certificate we can do

786
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,120
the the key update

787
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
in tls 1.3 using the post handshake

788
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
messages but the certificate check

789
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,120
would still need to be done and

790
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,159
in dls 1.3 we had the possibility to

791
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,159
basically take the certificate that

792
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,240
comes out of the handshake and then give

793
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,679
it up to the application and the

794
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
application can do the revocation check

795
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,799
again

796
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,840
now

797
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
we essentially have to store the

798
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
certificate in the application to ensure

799
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
that after a certain time we can recheck

800
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,919
the certificate regarding its revocation

801
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,520
state

802
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,360
so that was the

803
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
basic requirement there and the

804
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,200
requirement comes from the fact that

805
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,679
once in a while uh the certificate for

806
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,480
long

807
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,840
i'm sorry the certificate for long-lived

808
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,240
connection uh is required to be to be

809
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
checked

810
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
for the for its revocation state to

811
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
ensure that it is still valid why is the

812
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,320
sessions running

813
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,039
thanks thanks jeff yeah that was good

814
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,960
back on so in um we obviously have to

815
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,679
victor do you want to

816
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
uh victor de carney uh google i have a

817
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,399
question for stefan actually

818
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,760
uh why or rather what threats

819
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,880
uh if you could explain on list or

820
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
if not now

821
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,880
uh

822
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,399
do we want to know whether the

823
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,919
certificate is expired given the

824
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,320
sessions already established it'd be

825
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,799
good to know what the actual reason is

826
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
beyond just doing the thing we've been

827
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,720
doing

828
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,840
so we can't hear you um

829
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,080
you're mute

830
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,600
no no not not yet feels like a local

831
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,719
mute rather than a

832
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
now you're

833
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,399
me taco muted

834
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,000
test test test

835
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,279
no

836
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,679
nothing

837
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
it just worked so

838
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,159
that's mysterious

839
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,840
it just worked yes no

840
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,519
i think he's trying to get away not

841
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
answering that question

842
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,120
that's cheap stuff

843
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,240
[Laughter]

844
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
all right

845
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
he could at least hear my choke that's

846
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
good

847
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,880
yeah yeah um stefan you

848
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
you want to come back to this in in a

849
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,120
minute or two and then you can or you

850
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
can type it into the chat

851
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,200
um honest has a few slides to go so yeah

852
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,679
yeah so in any case uh regardless of

853
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
what the conclusion is we need to sort

854
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,519
of like say some i think we need to say

855
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,679
something in a document uh and explain

856
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,240
like uh for those who who have been

857
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
using dls 1.2

858
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
what that means in 1.3 as they move over

859
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,679
okay next one

860
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,279
so this is the one i mentioned

861
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,120
previously there were two items uh

862
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,200
client certificate validation and also

863
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
um

864
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,640
sni hiding which are two separate issues

865
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,519
waiting for uh michael's input won't go

866
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,320
into those details so obviously in

867
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
the item i would ping him during this

868
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,240
week so hopefully he has some cyclers

869
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,679
and the other one what

870
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,360
one other issue or two other issues are

871
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,200
related to profiling of timers that's

872
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,279
something we did in the previous profile

873
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,880
for 1.2

874
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,480
when we noticed that the use of dtls uh

875
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,320
this is a dtls feature

876
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
um

877
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,679
the default recommendations for the

878
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,919
timeouts were not really adequate for

879
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,960
some of the

880
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,399
uh iud

881
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,320
networks specifically mesh networks

882
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,480
which have a high latency and

883
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,519
potentially high loss rate and so we we

884
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,360
went through a long effort to sort of

885
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,080
adjust those timers of course the 1.3 is

886
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
a little different so um

887
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
we have to figure out what the timers

888
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,760
are and then uh also with the rrc sort

889
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,639
of the

890
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,520
uh

891
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,000
the checking or the the document that

892
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,679
we've been working on in the dls working

893
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
group to do the um

894
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,520
the

895
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
the checking needed for

896
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,320
the path validation for the

897
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,639
connection id changes

898
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,918
so

899
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,199
of course anyone who has experience with

900
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,760
using ddls and specifically 1.3 for some

901
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,839
of those networks

902
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,960
we're happy to hear your uh

903
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,800
your experience

904
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,480
okay that's it i think that's it

905
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,639
all right so um

906
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,079
we're looking at a couple more

907
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,800
iterations before

908
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,079
we're ready to

909
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,599
shepherd

910
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,400
um

911
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,720
at least at least uh definitely one to

912
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
address those comments as you like it's

913
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
we're getting down to sort of coming to

914
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,880
the end on this yeah okay so all right

915
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,760
all right thank you

916
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
all right um

917
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,599
and that gets us to

918
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,920
joe

919
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,960
see if i can

920
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,079
no i didn't want to share let's try that

921
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,280
here we go

922
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,240
back to syslog all right yes back to

923
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,960
says slog again

924
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,240
so um uh you can go to the next slide

925
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,359
uh

926
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,640
yeah this just is a document that uh

927
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,599
uh chris and sean and i uh are working

928
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,560
on

929
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,440
the kind of summary here is uh this has

930
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
recently been adopted as a working group

931
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,599
item which is fantastic uh we're

932
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,440
basically updating cipher suites and and

933
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,760
transport protocol for for these various

934
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,359
uh rfcs

935
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,160
and really what prompted this was uh

936
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
the iec

937
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,200
uh

938
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
tc57 wg15

939
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
group uh was

940
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,599
reusing was referencing these specs

941
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,040
and

942
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,079
the the specs reference some older cyber

943
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,440
suites

944
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,680
um and tls versions which

945
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
they in order to be compliant with the

946
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
specs they would have to implement the

947
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,560
old things they don't want to do that

948
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,480
obviously for for good reason um so

949
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,359
we're kind of we we fixed up these

950
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,560
particular

951
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
problems in the zero zero draft

952
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,480
um

953
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,680
by specifying modern cipher suite to be

954
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
used and uh

955
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,280
and

956
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,000
you know recent versions of tls

957
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
including tls one three

958
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
uh next slide

959
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
um

960
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,560
the uh only major change in uh

961
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
uh the zero one draft

962
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,920
is um

963
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
around zero rtt

964
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,040
um we decided uh

965
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
that

966
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
we shouldn't use zero rtt with um

967
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
and we should be explicit about it with

968
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,280
syslog

969
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,599
syslog doesn't really have a replay

970
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,960
protection

971
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
um and in many cases zero rtt it's not

972
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
really

973
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,839
i don't we we didn't feel this would be

974
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,000
a very widely used feature either

975
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
because

976
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,960
connections tend to be long-lived

977
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,520
so we say must not use early data

978
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
uh next slide

979
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
so

980
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,599
we've already published a

981
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,200
zero one so we'd love to get some more

982
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,000
review so folks if you

983
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,680
could give us a little bit of review

984
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
then we can take that to

985
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,359
hopefully get working group last call

986
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,200
soon

987
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,160
yeah i mean there's it's fairly

988
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
not a lot of complexity here so

989
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,040
it should be possible right so

990
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,599
can i get a like a indication race hands

991
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,760
or hums or something from people who

992
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,200
have back who have read this draft

993
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,520
phone number can i get a few of you to

994
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,400
like say yes i will review this

995
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,119
so we can get um victor

996
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
um

997
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
on this

998
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
right

999
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,440
right

1000
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
that's good so we can get victor and

1001
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,599
hannes uh on the record having having

1002
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,280
volunteered to review

1003
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,839
that um sort of gets us that much closer

1004
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,320
to uh working group last call and like

1005
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
shepard that's very

1006
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,839
okay good

1007
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,839
right great that's it

1008
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,440
um

1009
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
which uh

1010
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,800
takes us it gets us to

1011
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,280
open mic for this meeting

1012
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
um

1013
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,920
and if nobody has

1014
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
anything

1015
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
um

1016
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
maybe something

1017
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,160
ben schwartz uh on the topic of ip

1018
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,040
address identities and certificates uh

1019
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,320
i i wanted to mention that

1020
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,440
the

1021
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
add working group has run into an

1022
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
interesting situation

1023
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,640
where

1024
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,079
it would be

1025
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
very convenient if there were a way to

1026
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
mint a certificate that claims uh all

1027
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,200
the ip addresses in a subnet

1028
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,240
so uh so that somebody who for example

1029
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,320
an isp that owns a wide ip range could

1030
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,920
have a certificate that says yes i

1031
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,720
am

1032
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,359
willing and able to terminate traffic

1033
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,240
for

1034
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,119
uh for all of the

1035
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:53,920
uh

1036
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,839
all of the identities and this all the

1037
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,680
ip address identities

1038
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
in this range

1039
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,320
uh currently i think there's no way to

1040
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,319
spell that so anyway if anybody's

1041
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,119
interested in in talking about that

1042
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,880
that use case which is related to uh

1043
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,800
encrypted dns on ipv6 home gateways

1044
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,760
um

1045
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,599
talk to me

1046
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,520
and this is related to the

1047
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
the um

1048
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,040
public suffix licks list stuff right uh

1049
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,400
so the

1050
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,560
the motivation to briefly the the

1051
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,800
motivation is that

1052
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,319
uh

1053
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,839
the the add ddr mechanism

1054
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,720
uh if the if the home gateway's dns

1055
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
server is identified by a public

1056
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,079
address like a public ipv6 address as

1057
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,920
opposed to a link local

1058
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
address

1059
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
uh then

1060
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,480
the encrypted dns server must present a

1061
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,359
certificate that covers that ipv6

1062
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,720
address

1063
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
and so

1064
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,400
if an isp wanted to

1065
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,480
operate an encrypted dns

1066
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,750
service for all of its users

1067
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,160
[Music]

1068
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,200
then in this configuration they would

1069
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,160
uh first of all uh per eric's comment

1070
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,240
that they would need some way in the sni

1071
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,040
to find out which ip address the client

1072
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,800
uh is trying to connect

1073
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,119
is trying to find a substitute for and

1074
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,960
secondly they would need separate

1075
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
certificates for for every single ip

1076
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
address of every single

1077
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,800
dns resolver and all of their customers

1078
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
home gateways instead of

1079
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
one big certificate that just says i

1080
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
claim the entire ip range

1081
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,480
anyway this is not something that's

1082
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,160
possible today it would be an entirely

1083
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,599
new

1084
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,720
identifier format for x509

1085
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,880
victor yes uh hi victor mccartney i have

1086
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,119
a question i guess for for the working

1087
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,280
group in terms of where to propose

1088
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
something

1089
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,200
uh

1090
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
i'd like to

1091
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,400
i think having possibly an extension

1092
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,480
for a tls client

1093
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,960
to tell the server to solicit its

1094
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,480
certificate

1095
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,200
uh because as we know tls client

1096
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,560
certificates are optional if the server

1097
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,079
doesn't ask for them the client can't

1098
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,160
present them

1099
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,520
and yet some servers for

1100
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,400
interoperability reasons prefer not to

1101
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
ask for them by default

1102
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,960
if a client knows that

1103
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,920
it is desirable to present a certificate

1104
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
but the server is likely not to solicit

1105
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
them by default

1106
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
uh there could be a need for a message

1107
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,079
for a client to say hi i have a

1108
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,359
certificate

1109
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,520
in in the client hello or somewhere

1110
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,000
early on without disclosing much detail

1111
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,240
about it because but privacy issues

1112
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,440
until it goes into certificate

1113
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,319
extensions in tls103 and is encrypted uh

1114
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,040
so i'd like there to be an early message

1115
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,520
uh to say please grab my certificate i'm

1116
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,119
interested for this in email where i

1117
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,079
could do it in an esmtp hello but it

1118
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,079
kind of seems like the wrong layer

1119
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,680
should i take this to the tls working

1120
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
group to utah

1121
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,480
should i just do it in the esmtp which

1122
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,240
unasks the question but kind of does it

1123
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
at the wrong layer

1124
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,119
any thoughts or comments it's a perfect

1125
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,280
question to bounce right over to our ad

1126
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
yes

1127
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,400
you were hoping not to be involved today

1128
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,880
so i have sad news for you i'm not the

1129
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,359
cognizant ad i'm just a spectator oh man

1130
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,839
i'm sorry damn it but if we repeat it

1131
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,640
i'm happy to sorry so right so the

1132
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,760
question is where does where do where do

1133
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
extensions to tls go that could be

1134
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,000
applicable to specific application

1135
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,119
domains

1136
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,359
um

1137
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,640
yeah right i mean that would be exactly

1138
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,920
kind of my first question i would have

1139
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
to take i mean i think i would but the

1140
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,119
responsibility would have to take a look

1141
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,560
at the charter in this working group

1142
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
would make sense well i i think it makes

1143
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,040
sense for it to be here but also it

1144
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,480
makes sense for it to be in a bunch of

1145
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,400
other places absolutely i mean i think

1146
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,760
it's hard to have a universal answer to

1147
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,119
that yeah

1148
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,160
would be my personal opinion

1149
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,920
i was just going to say there's nothing

1150
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,240
stopping someone in any working group

1151
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,720
here or even groups outside of the ietf

1152
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,040
from defining tls extensions that's not

1153
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,720
the problem the problem i think would be

1154
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,359
the charter of this group which i think

1155
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,720
probably

1156
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,960
maybe doesn't include the ability to do

1157
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,200
that without a rechartering but if this

1158
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,319
is the right place to do it i think we

1159
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,160
should just tweak the charter and make

1160
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,480
it happen

1161
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,480
personal opinion i've always understood

1162
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,760
this working group to be kind of a

1163
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,599
catch-all a last resort there's no place

1164
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,119
else to do it there's clearly a pile of

1165
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,800
expertise here let's leverage that

1166
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,359
expertise for expediency

1167
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,400
yeah

1168
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
certainly a group that had had a life

1169
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,400
expectancy far beyond sort of the

1170
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,319
initial set of best practice documents

1171
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,960
that i think people were envisioning uh

1172
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
i i would encourage you to write

1173
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
something up uh

1174
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
draft up and presented and

1175
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,319
we can talk about that option here or in

1176
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,560
the whatever working group makes sense

1177
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
so i i

1178
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
you know

1179
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,960
personally i think it sounds interesting

1180
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,960
too

1181
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,400
all right

1182
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,960
going

1183
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,200
oh

1184
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,280
oh mark well martin is on the queue but

1185
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,800
i think he

1186
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
you were

1187
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,319
yeah

1188
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
