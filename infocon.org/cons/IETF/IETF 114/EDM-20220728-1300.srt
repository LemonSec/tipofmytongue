1
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
all right good morning

2
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
all right i think we uh we'll get

3
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
started here now um

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
the

5
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,840
the chat already has the edm music going

6
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,200
uh so thank you brian for providing that

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
um

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
yeah so welcome to the first in-person

9
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
meeting of the edm program uh

10
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
so

11
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,400
uh today we're going to talk about

12
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
mainly one draft but i also wanted to

13
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
give a quick

14
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
intro just to what the program is for

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,200
the people who haven't

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
been on the calls that we've had

17
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
virtually those have usually been

18
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,640
relatively small and focused but

19
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
it's easier to have these things when we

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
have

21
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
an actual crowd to meet

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
uh david and i are leading this from the

23
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,360
ib side but it is open to participation

24
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
and input from the whole community um

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
which is how

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
kind of the the current generation of

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,760
iab technical programs are working in

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
general um so

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
thank you for being here and uh

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,720
contributing

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
just so um for some background on what

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
the program is

33
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
as mellow is saying it's very easy to

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
forget what edm stands for since it has

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,640
such a strong connotation in our minds

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
for other things

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but it is evolvability deployability and

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
maintainability um so it's been running

39
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
for like about two years now it is a

40
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,200
technical program that we have

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,959
so our goal is to have good technical

42
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,640
discussions

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
work on documents when that's

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
appropriate but also just kind of figure

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,959
out what are the right things that we

46
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,480
should be doing as a community

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
technically on things

48
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
and the topics here um

49
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
yeah i also cannot believe this has been

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
two years yeah weird

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
evolvability deployability and

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
maintainability so evolvability um i

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,439
think is

54
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
mainly around taking up some of the work

55
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,599
that had been done previously in iab

56
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,519
around preventing ossification figuring

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
out how do we maintain extensibility

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
that's related to one of the documents

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
we've previously published

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
deployability is looking at the aspect

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
of how we make sure that we continue to

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,040
encourage running code and

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
interoperability and other things we can

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
do

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
in the ietf to make that process easier

66
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
and better and then maintainability is

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,720
understanding what are the best

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
practices for protocol maintenance

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
and how protocols are going to live on

70
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
after we finish their rfcs and the

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,880
working groups

72
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,919
so we're trying to understand like

73
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,280
what's the life cycle to make sure that

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
our things are actually working

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
so as far as you know what have we done

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,880
we did publish rc 9170

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
which was the use it or lose it draft

78
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
formally titled the long-term viability

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
of protocol extension mechanisms

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
we've talked

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,199
more recently about how to associate

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,759
implementations and try to help people

83
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
who are working on code

84
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
get things a bit more involved

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
charles had written a draft of finding

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
code and recently we added some data

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
tracker tags to explicitly call out

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
related implementations

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,759
i know that was discussed i think at one

90
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
of the recent working group

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,039
chairs meetings this week

92
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
oh sure so

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
i think we need to do more

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,919
publicity around it i we have talked

95
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,600
about it on the working group chairs

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
let's essentially say people try it out

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
i mean

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
the tags in data tracker have

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
essentially related material for a

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
document or a working group

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
those are pretty

102
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
flexible as it is but we formally

103
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
defined like a related implementations

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
tag

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
because we've done a survey of the

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
chairs

107
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
in general and just tried to see you

108
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
know how are people tracking these

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
things there's a big diversity but

110
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
having easy ways to if you are coming to

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,600
the ietf as someone who's just i'm

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
implementing this draft or this

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,520
i'm working in this group

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
who else is working on this where do i

115
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
find the hackathon projects

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
if we can start formalizing and saying

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
like hey if you're having great

118
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
hackathon projects let people know where

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,400
they are such that if they're reading

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
your document

121
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,199
we can tie those together and so that's

122
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,840
just like a first step and we want to

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,880
see with that

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
it's not really an experiment but like

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
what can we do to

126
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,759
use that and see how it goes in working

127
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,720
group so

128
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,880
i encourage people to use it and i think

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,639
it's a call that we should

130
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,440
uh

131
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
make that more widely known

132
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,919
sorry another quick question is that

133
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,120
just on drafts or also on rfcs

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
um

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
i think it would work yeah it should be

136
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
both yeah and you could also have it on

137
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
a working group

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
main page too to say like you know tls

139
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
could just say here are

140
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
here's my page where i list all the

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
current tls

142
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
main libraries that you can play with

143
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,440
yeah and just uh

144
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
in case you go to try to use this one of

145
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,680
the things i i didn't realize was uh as

146
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
much of an issue perhaps limitation on

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
it or no restriction um if it's an

148
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
individual draft the the person

149
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
submitting the draft can go on

150
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
if it's already a working group draft or

151
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,720
an rfc

152
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,680
uh the working group chair of the group

153
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
that that is in or came out

154
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
it has to do it

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,039
right

156
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,720
yeah which is i'm just kind of the

157
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,319
nature of how data tracker stuff works

158
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
like i know i have

159
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
requested

160
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
some chairs to say like hey can you

161
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,720
please add this tag for something i'm

162
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
working on so that people can know how

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
to find it

164
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,479
um

165
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,080
so maybe that's something that we can

166
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
also improve the process on yes uh

167
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,919
started using it in two working groups

168
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,039
since charles talked about it the

169
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
working group chairs lunch

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
one of the groups that i sent it to they

171
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,319
actually had problems figuring out the

172
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,360
fact that you could actually have

173
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
multiple entries there which is

174
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
documented on there so i help them with

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,639
that but the part about how to add the

176
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
label tag in parentheses is not

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
documented or whatever so we just need

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,879
to advertise that part more because i

179
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
had problems with that but i'm now using

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
it it works great great yeah and i think

181
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
like when i had emailed out i was like

182
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
here's the different ways you could do

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,680
it but

184
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
maybe that's a feedback we can take to

185
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,639
the tools team of like it should be

186
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
easier to like have a form of just like

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,000
add this type of tag with this label add

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
that tag with that label

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,599
um yeah

190
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
um paul hawking again so

191
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
i propose this is not just something for

192
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,440
working group chairs i mean this sounds

193
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,599
great i haven't been wearing a blue dot

194
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,120
in the last few years so i didn't know

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
about it um if y'all once once you've

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,599
done like once you feel like the

197
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
documentation's writing stuff if you

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
could send a message to

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,480
you know ietf at

200
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
saying this exists and such like that i

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
think a bunch more people will bug their

202
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,000
work and group chairs yes to do it yup

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
thank you so yeah i mean

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
thank you for doing that so like i think

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
as we get some feedback from

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
the chairs initially then we can say all

207
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
right here's

208
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
how here's some examples of how people

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
are using it

210
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
if you want to use it in your working

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
group bug your chairs yeah

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
great

213
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
all right

214
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
and then

215
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
for the remainder of the session

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
discussion today

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
one of the other things we've been

218
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
working on now on the maintenance side

219
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
of the edm

220
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
uh trifecta

221
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,000
is a draft that had been adopted by the

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,839
iab previously quite a while ago

223
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
draft ib protocol maintenance

224
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
and this is something that

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,839
has evolved uh martin was the original

226
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
author david uh

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
took up

228
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,680
co-editing it um as a current iab member

229
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
and

230
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
we've had uh

231
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,880
quite a bit of discussion on

232
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
architecture discuss

233
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
about some of the details here so

234
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
in general when we've discussed this on

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
the ib

236
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
you know

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
it's something that you know we would

238
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
like to move forward um you know

239
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
we acknowledge that is not

240
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
ever going to be something that is

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
perfect and everyone's going to have

242
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,200
complete consensus on but we would like

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
to get

244
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
progress on it and this is a good group

245
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
i think to give some feedback on what

246
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,839
are some of the refinements we can make

247
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
before publishing

248
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,519
so with that

249
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,920
david do you

250
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
yeah github or anything uh that's a good

251
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,399
point i didn't make any slides we'll see

252
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,920
if we maybe present bits of the draft um

253
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
so thanks tommy for the summary that was

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
good we

255
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,720
we got some pretty spirited discussion

256
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
on the uh architecture discuss list uh

257
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,880
fun times and we decided oh well let's

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
let's chat in person things always work

259
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
out better when we're face to face uh

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
even if virtually so

261
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,040
what i was thinking is um maybe starting

262
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
with

263
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
like the definition of the robustness

264
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
principle that we chose to use in this

265
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,600
document because it became clear that

266
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
those words didn't mean the exact same

267
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
thing for everyone

268
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
and we had to pick one uh we picked the

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
one that was like the oldest star of c

270
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,760
we could find

271
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,959
um

272
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
a sensible option i i can totally see

273
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
that there are other interpretations but

274
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,680
just to set the stage

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,800
um

276
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,120
when the so the the overall

277
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,959
message of the document is

278
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
um we had the robustness principle which

279
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,440
said

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
uh you know follow the spec but

281
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
you're you're gonna find something a

282
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
condition that's like not clear in the

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
spec uh because it's not possible to

284
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
make a perfect spec otherwise we

285
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
wouldn't have job security

286
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,440
um

287
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,160
and when you do how do you react to that

288
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
and the

289
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,519
leading idea in the 90s was

290
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,480
you are liberal in what you get meaning

291
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,000
you take this erroneous input and

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,639
[Music]

293
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,680
you make do you do not error and that's

294
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,279
that's like in rc 1958 the message there

295
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
um no not 58

296
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,440
right oh yes 58 okay thanks and and

297
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
specifically i think the text we quote

298
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
is like you know allow what you accept

299
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
unless the spec

300
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
tells you otherwise but the default is

301
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
don't error just exactly this is for

302
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
cases when you don't have the spec

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
yeah yeah let me finish my quick intro

304
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
and then dave it's your your first step

305
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,079
and then so the message in in this

306
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,399
document is uh the world has changed

307
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,639
quite a bit since the 90s

308
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,279
and what worked really well then and

309
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,959
what actually got the internet up and

310
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
running isn't neces necessarily the best

311
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
advice that we can give today

312
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
and the document goes into some detail

313
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,760
of what problems can arise if you follow

314
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,279
this to the

315
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,240
pretty

316
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,040
to its logical conclusion and proposes

317
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
alternatives

318
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
specifically protocol maintenance when

319
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,279
you have the ability to evolve specs

320
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
over time and evolve implementations and

321
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,600
their deployment of such implementations

322
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
over time

323
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
so

324
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
the document has come a long way in

325
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
terms of

326
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
overly focusing on the negative at first

327
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
we still have a ways to go we have a pr

328
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
that wants to improve this

329
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
but it's kind of the idea is

330
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
the robustness principle is no longer

331
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
the best thing we have we have something

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
else that is protocol maintenance

333
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
so now i'm opening the floor

334
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,519
dave okay so

335
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
first let me prefix my comments by

336
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
saying uh i think that's a a bunch of

337
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,399
good stuff in there that i actually

338
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,880
agree with okay and so the core

339
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
technical the core point that you're

340
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
trying to make in the draft right i'm in

341
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,000
agreement with okay i do have to admit

342
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,519
that when i read the draft i had a

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
fairly strong negative reaction to the

344
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
tone and i'll explain why even though i

345
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,279
agreed with the technical points

346
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,800
and it gets to that same point about the

347
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
robustness principle meaning different

348
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
things okay uh that there's at least

349
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
four different things that you can think

350
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
of or that i can think of anyway when

351
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
you say be conservative on what you say

352
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
and liberal what you accept or whatever

353
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
three of which are good things and one

354
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,800
of which is a bad thing okay and right

355
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
now it comes across as saying the

356
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
robustness principle itself is bad and

357
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
therefore all four are bad and hence the

358
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,880
strong negative reactions about the

359
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,399
other three that are good things okay

360
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,360
and the things you're pointing about are

361
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
bad things i agree with right uh but the

362
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
title and the tone come across as

363
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
throwing the baby out with bath water

364
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
which if you're not an english idiom

365
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
person that means you find one bad thing

366
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,040
and you assume that the whole thing is

367
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,240
bad

368
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
and so my list of four things um it

369
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,920
comes down to

370
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
uh depending on how you interpret it the

371
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,240
quote from 760 which i agree is bad

372
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
right that's the one that talks about uh

373
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
the the bad aspect of the four that says

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
when bugs come in you should be liberal

375
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,519
in accepting those bugs or whatever

376
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,720
which is the whole point of the spec

377
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
right got that one okay

378
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
that rfc is obsolete

379
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
so some people would argue that that

380
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,440
interpretation of the robustness

381
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
principle is also obsolete

382
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
1958 on the other hand which is quoted

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
says at least in my reading the exact

384
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,279
opposite okay it says

385
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
if you see something that doesn't look

386
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
right you silently drop it it does not

387
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,600
say to accept it okay it says to drop it

388
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
okay that's one of the good things okay

389
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
so the good things are um

390
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,120
if there are

391
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
errors like a bug or whatever that you

392
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
don't crash okay that's one definition

393
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,279
of robustness is that you stay up and

394
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,680
running in the presence of errors right

395
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
you don't crash okay so one definition

396
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
of robustus principle is

397
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
don't crash when you see unexpected

398
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
input okay

399
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
third one is robustness to attacks okay

400
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,440
someone's actually trying to attack you

401
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
and intentionally sending you things

402
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
that violate the spec you should be

403
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
robust to that too okay so that's also

404
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,120
both of the number two and number three

405
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
i claim are purely

406
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,639
uh valid in the interpretation of what

407
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
1958 says in other words in 1958 and 760

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,680
i see as being almost opposite

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
definitions of the roughness principle

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
in terms of if you

411
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
accept and try to treat as valid errors

412
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,279
versus if you treat as invalid errors

413
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
and then continue on operation without

414
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
uh detrimental effects right both of

415
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
those are interpretations of robustness

416
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
principle okay i claim that the invalid

417
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
one is the obsoleted one in 760 and the

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
correct one is the 1958 not obsoleted

419
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
one okay that's why my negative reaction

420
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,399
even though i agree with the points

421
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
about 760s interpretation

422
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
the last definition of the robustus

423
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
prince would be robustness to variations

424
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
in maize and shoulds right just because

425
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
you do a particular variation of amazing

426
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
shows you still have to be robust to the

427
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
other guy according to the spec right

428
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,240
the spec a well-written spec actually is

429
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
written that way to allow you to

430
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,040
interoperate with people that make a

431
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
different set of choices you can argue

432
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
that that's also liberal and what you

433
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
accept in the sense of a different

434
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
variation within this spec

435
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
all four of those are ways of

436
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
interpreting be conservative what you

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
send in liberty and what you accept only

438
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
the first one is the harmful one okay so

439
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,439
that's why i have a problem with the

440
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
title and the tone even though i agree

441
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
with the content about that first

442
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
interpretation being bad and all the

443
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
good things that are in there are great

444
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760
stuff to have in there

445
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,439
so i personally would rather frame the

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
document about

447
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,319
you know the correct application the

448
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
resonance principle define it

449
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,439
so there's these four different

450
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,799
interpretations three of them are good

451
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,240
and here's how to apply them and this

452
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
one is bad and here's how to do stuff

453
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
instead so that's what i would like to

454
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
see the document become and then i would

455
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
very much support it so

456
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,640
thanks dave um yeah i'm seeing a lot of

457
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
reactions coming to the queue uh or

458
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,559
people who just want to make comments

459
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,600
that's great

460
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,559
so

461
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,000
i think everyone in this room can agree

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
that

463
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,559
if you get

464
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,640
input that you consider as faulty you

465
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
shouldn't crash i think everyone's on

466
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,960
that same page right also it doesn't say

467
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,320
that right now it says the robustness

468
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,600
principle is harmful a lot of you saying

469
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
you can take that with this

470
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
that's true i

471
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
personally don't see that as necessarily

472
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,559
the robust principle it feels like

473
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
common sense but it's also that like

474
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,960
it's been done for so long

475
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
that you know i i assumed it as a you

476
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
know one of the laws of physics but

477
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,640
maybe yeah calling it the part of the

478
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,280
robustness principle makes sense

479
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,240
and then

480
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,039
same for reacting to attacks

481
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,120
everyone's in agreement don't let

482
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
attackers

483
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,919
beat you

484
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,200
on the

485
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
other uh on the the point and i think

486
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
that's the one where maybe we we

487
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
disagree on this one

488
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
is

489
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
if you get faulty input and it's not

490
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,280
clear what the spec tells you to do

491
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
um

492
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,679
your

493
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,039
options

494
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
are to you know accept it and like

495
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
process it fully i think we can all

496
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
agree that's a bad idea because that was

497
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
the original one that got obsoleted

498
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
another option is to

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
discard it silently

500
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,919
and the third option is to error

501
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
and

502
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
the idea and that's what it's what's

503
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
very

504
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,039
clearly written in 1958

505
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
and that's what this document says is

506
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
harmful and because

507
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
if you

508
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,320
discard it silently you allow the other

509
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
party to keep going

510
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
and

511
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,720
and to never notice their bug so

512
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
you end up in a situation where i think

513
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,039
this was a point that stewart made and i

514
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,520
liked how he phrased it was

515
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,919
unlike other sdos the itf doesn't have

516
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
conformance tests

517
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,080
and so kind of the first implementation

518
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,440
out there becomes the conformance test

519
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
and

520
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
if that implementation

521
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,280
errors when you send something bad

522
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
you're immediately going to fix your

523
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
code you're not

524
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
good and

525
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
so and then we go into detail in the

526
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
document about this specific thing but

527
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,080
silently dropping instead of airing

528
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,000
leads to an accumulation of these

529
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
problems that leads to then people

530
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,760
building workarounds and you end up with

531
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,000
the the world converging to one of two

532
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,960
states

533
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
if you

534
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,400
silently discard you end up with

535
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,280
everyone kind of

536
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
having workarounds for people not doing

537
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
it for sending them the wrong thing

538
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
whereas if you have a state of the world

539
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
where everyone errors you end up in a

540
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
point where all the implementations are

541
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
pretty strict and the state of the world

542
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
matches the specification more closely

543
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
and that's a point that i i don't think

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
everyone agrees on

545
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,880
but that's what we're trying to get

546
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
across in the document

547
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,158
all right and maria

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
i wanted to say the same thing but in

549
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
just less words than david just said um

550
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,919
so about crashing i think crashing is

551
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,280
not part of the rashma's principle

552
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
nobody wants to crash that

553
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
implementation it's always an

554
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,039
implantation bug right so i don't think

555
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
that's ever on purpose and the

556
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,480
difference is really what we're talking

557
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
about is like silent drop or not silent

558
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
drop right and i think silent drop and

559
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
that if that's the only reaction is

560
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,679
actually always wrong the minimum you

561
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,600
should do is lock the error

562
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,679
and you might even decide to like stop

563
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,840
the connection and enforce the right

564
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
behavior

565
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
and i think that's like always true for

566
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
any protocol

567
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,440
thanks tommy

568
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
all right uh

569
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
thanks dave for

570
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
the the kind of taxonomy of the

571
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,640
different types

572
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
yeah we aren't actually the same person

573
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,760
um

574
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
you have to identify your davids yeah

575
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,039
exactly

576
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,480
i i think that is definitely helpful um

577
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,559
so yeah i agree that you have the the

578
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,039
number one of just be liberal and when

579
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,960
you accept that one you know obsoleted

580
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,679
and not great i definitely agree with

581
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
like the number three and four of you

582
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
have to be robust to attacks

583
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
um and

584
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,600
you have to be robust to the maze and

585
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
shoulds the things that let you have

586
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,559
variation um

587
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,840
then i think

588
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,080
the part i want to dig in on is similar

589
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
to what david was bringing up about it's

590
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
like the silent part so like yeah

591
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
obviously don't crash

592
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,840
um

593
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,440
but i think you know the silent dropping

594
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
is probably not the ideal state we're in

595
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,159
it can point to a problem in

596
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,919
specifications that you know

597
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,440
specification really

598
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
should have you send an explicit error

599
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
if the other side's doing something

600
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
wrong

601
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
of course specifications will have

602
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
issues and problems and they will miss

603
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
things that they will have places where

604
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
they don't tell you to do it

605
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,799
um

606
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,240
then one of the other things at least

607
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,840
when we look at what we did in use it or

608
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,240
lose it and talk about extensibility we

609
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
also talk about how you want to be very

610
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
clear for what are your variation points

611
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,480
and your sensibility points um

612
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,039
so in those cases

613
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
you know i think we could also we we

614
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
could have an approach where you say

615
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
the implementations implementations if

616
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
they see something that they have no

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
idea how to parse

618
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,640
should kind of just go to an error state

619
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
because a specification if it intended

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,159
to have an extensibility point that

621
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,440
you're going to have variation on this

622
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
in

623
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
it's on the specification to be very

624
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,159
clear about what is my extension point

625
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,760
and so then you have to allow that

626
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,000
through and so hey i see a new

627
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
uh

628
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
packet type come in that i don't

629
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
recognize okay i'm not going to

630
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
error on that

631
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,760
now

632
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
part of this also i think matters on how

633
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
uh reliable or authenticated the channel

634
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
is here um because if we're trying to

635
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,520
make this

636
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
work with the attackers

637
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,679
like if i if this is about high process

638
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,840
incoming ip packets that anyone can

639
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,039
inject to me

640
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,720
you know obviously if there's something

641
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
bad

642
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,520
on that like

643
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
i shouldn't just like reset

644
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
i i shouldn't do really abortive things

645
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
if someone just injected one kind of

646
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
packet of death to try to make me do bad

647
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,600
things to appear

648
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,679
um if that for some reason like i can't

649
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,440
authenticate it you inject a uv packet

650
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
to me and now i close down all my quick

651
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
connections like that would be a bad

652
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
state to be in

653
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
but if i do have an authenticated

654
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
channel to someone so i essentially know

655
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,360
i'm i am talking to someone on the other

656
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
side who

657
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
i believe

658
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
you know is compliant with this protocol

659
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
if they start sending me garbage on

660
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,039
something that is not an extension point

661
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
and like i cannot parse

662
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
it probably is best for me to

663
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,279
close that connection or have some sort

664
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,360
of error and ideally the specification

665
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,279
tells me to do that

666
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,200
but if there's some weird edge case that

667
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,320
it did not explicitly say oh if these

668
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
bits aren't correct and you can't parse

669
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,679
this and the you're gonna have a buffer

670
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,440
overflow if you try to go beyond this

671
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,799
when you're parsing the stream you

672
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,159
should probably close the stream rather

673
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
than just like silently dropping packets

674
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
forever so

675
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,279
that's i think maybe

676
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,320
where

677
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
some of this document is trying to get

678
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
at and i don't know how we name

679
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,640
that aspect of it such that we say hey

680
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
this one little bit in here is the part

681
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
that we think

682
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,559
uh

683
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,159
needs more thought when you're

684
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
developing the protocol as well as

685
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,720
writing your implementation and trying

686
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
to have like a default state for

687
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
handling

688
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,960
garbage input

689
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,520
thanks tommy i see brian in the virtual

690
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
cue good to see you brian

691
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,919
i'll see if you can see me hello um

692
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
good morning everyone um so

693
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,000
i i was a little bit struck by uh dave

694
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
thaler's sort of uh thank you very much

695
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
for you know starting off with the

696
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,520
uh sort of the taxonomy of different

697
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
things we can do in the history of this

698
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,120
we're we're talking about

699
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
um some changes that were made to the

700
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
interpretation the robustness principle

701
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,000
in a three-digit rfc that were made in a

702
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
40-rfc whose first digit is one right so

703
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,400
we're talking about sort of like

704
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,720
discussions that happened still 25-30

705
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
years ago

706
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,720
what struck me about why this document

707
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
exists and something that i want to talk

708
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
a little bit more about in this

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
discussion

710
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
is

711
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,919
that

712
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
the way that the protocol development

713
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,559
and deployment life cycle works in the

714
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,640
world has changed since that point in

715
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,440
time

716
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
and pointedly things that might make

717
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,159
sense in one phase of the point of the

718
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,919
of a protocol's development deployment

719
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,440
life cycle don't make sense sorry brian

720
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,159
you you cut out just uh you said point

721
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
at things that might and then it paused

722
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,039
maybe turn off your video

723
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,600
okay um

724
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,120
is this better

725
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
it is two three four five six

726
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,559
uh crap i don't remember what i said in

727
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,480
had i haven't talked about protocol life

728
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
cycles yet yes protocol life cycles have

729
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,919
changed for deployment protocol life

730
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,240
cycles have changed and pointedly one of

731
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
the big things that has changed is that

732
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
sort of the development you know early

733
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,600
development

734
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
and

735
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
deployment and maturity life cycles and

736
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,159
a lot of cases in many deployments are

737
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,400
going to overlap as opposed to being

738
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
distinct phases of the protocol life

739
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
cycle so when we say

740
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,159
you know when i originally put myself in

741
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,720
the queue because it's like i think we

742
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
can all agree someone said i think we

743
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
can all agree that you shouldn't crash

744
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,520
well

745
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,360
maybe at early in the protocol life

746
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
cycle if you're basically doing early

747
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
interrupt may be the right thing to do

748
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
if you get into a

749
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
an error state because the other side

750
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,200
has sent you garbage is drop the

751
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
connection right like that might

752
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,039
actually in that point in the deployment

753
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
or if you're in an environment where you

754
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,039
actually can do can do quick restart

755
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,520
that might be the right thing to do so

756
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,279
so it might

757
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,960
make sense

758
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
to

759
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
approach

760
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
the differences in what we think the

761
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
appropriate behavior are in terms of

762
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
where we are in the protocol life cycle

763
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
and acknowledge that the reason that

764
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
this document

765
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
exists now and if published will have a

766
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
first digit of nine as opposed to a

767
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,279
first digit of one is because that has

768
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
changed um in a lot of deployments in

769
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,439
the world

770
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,960
thank you very much

771
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,720
okay thank you brian

772
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,159
and next is stuart

773
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,799
thank you uh stuart cheshire from apple

774
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,520
um i agree 100 with what dave thaler

775
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
said

776
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,159
um

777
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
dave is always great at

778
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,240
seeing a broader perspective and

779
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
spotting our unconscious assumptions

780
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,320
and i think this is a great example of

781
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
that

782
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,600
that i mean i love the taxonomy and i

783
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,960
think they should be spelled out in the

784
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,000
document because

785
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
one of the first lessons i learned on my

786
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
first job was if your code crashes it's

787
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
your fault you don't point at the packet

788
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,679
trace and say well they sent the wrong

789
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,640
packet

790
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
um i've internalized this but other

791
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
people reading the document might not

792
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,320
have learned that lesson so

793
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
yes i think it would be great to spell

794
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,360
out

795
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,960
um you said something else that's

796
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
probably obvious to everybody in this

797
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,320
room

798
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
when we're talking about being less

799
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,240
liberal with what you accept

800
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,039
if the protocol specifies a documented

801
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,440
extension mechanism like there's a tlv

802
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,720
that goes here

803
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,919
you shouldn't drop the connection

804
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,440
because there's a tlv there that's not

805
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,679
the kind of conservatism we mean we're

806
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,720
talking about

807
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,520
being stricter about pro about

808
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
specification violations we're not

809
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,279
talking about being strict in the sense

810
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,919
that i don't support the optional stuff

811
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,200
and i'll throw a tantrum if somebody

812
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
else tries to use it um

813
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
all this is kind of obvious but but

814
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
that's what you're great at dave is

815
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
spotting the things that the people in

816
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
this room uh are taking for granted

817
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,279
and a document like this

818
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,799
is supposed to be educational for the

819
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
whole industry so thank you for pointing

820
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
that out

821
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
i'll give one example from one of the

822
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
things i worked on recently dns stateful

823
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,520
operations we had a debate there

824
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,039
and i tried to be really strict

825
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,320
everywhere in the document where it has

826
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,279
a must

827
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,399
it says

828
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,360
uh this field must not be zero if this

829
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,640
flag is set

830
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,799
well anytime you have a must

831
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,799
what goes the other side of that coin is

832
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,360
yeah but what if that's violated

833
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,440
so you're telling the sender you must do

834
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,919
this we also have to tell the receiver

835
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,919
and if the sender doesn't what do you do

836
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
and in almost all cases we stated

837
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,600
specifically

838
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
um sender must not do this and if it

839
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,799
does the receiver must abort the tcp

840
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,880
connection immediately now we could have

841
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,159
said

842
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,399
silently ignore that one message

843
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,559
and continue processing the subsequent

844
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,559
messages on the connection that would be

845
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,720
also been a valid answer

846
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,159
and i didn't particularly care which we

847
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,039
did but i did care that we specified

848
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
clearly in the document what you're

849
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,480
supposed to do rather than leaving it

850
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
ambiguous

851
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,000
thank you stuart back to dave

852
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,840
sorry i was typing because i completely

853
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,039
agree with you and would love that point

854
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,799
to be made in the in the in the in the

855
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,799
document um and i saw um i think antoine

856
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,399
or whatever made a comment in chat that

857
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,640
gets to someone like why i put myself

858
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
back in the queue i think one of the

859
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
good parts of the draft meaning that the

860
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
main point of the draft or whatever is

861
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,480
to is uh david's

862
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
point about uh sending errors rather

863
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
than silently accepting things

864
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,440
i think one of the reasons so if you get

865
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,360
strong negative reactions on things then

866
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
it's then i've found that in my

867
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,600
experience often that as

868
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,840
somebody believes that it's being over

869
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,440
applied to a particular case that they

870
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
can think of okay so it makes me

871
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,039
question whether it needs an often or a

872
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,480
conditional mosque or something like

873
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,320
that so if i see strong negative

874
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
reactions on stuff i say okay am i over

875
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
applying this somehow and i do i need to

876
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,919
constrain is there some other case you

877
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
need to call out and i think it's the

878
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,279
job of a good ieb spec to actually call

879
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,480
out those considerations when those

880
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,720
tussles are those things that occur that

881
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,480
says well it's there most of the time

882
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,919
but this other case maybe it's not you

883
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,000
have to admit that whatever so i found

884
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,360
usually when i've seen stronger

885
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
reactions it's because somebody they

886
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,240
think that the statement is being over

887
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,159
applied i think that might be the case

888
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,039
here

889
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,039
um because i agree with the point that

890
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,559
david made right that says if i've got a

891
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,440
channel with somebody and they're

892
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,919
sending a malformed packet at me then i

893
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,120
should abort the connection center or

894
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
whatever rather than silently accept it

895
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
okay i said this stuff the main point of

896
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,679
the document i actually agree with right

897
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
so don't get me wrong um but there's

898
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,519
some misapplication of that that says if

899
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,960
i don't already have a channel with

900
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,559
somebody okay

901
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,320
and i have a denial of denial of service

902
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,159
attack for example then in that case

903
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,080
it's often better to drop stuff rather

904
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,399
than try to send an error which can lead

905
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,000
itself to a denial of zero's attack

906
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,360
right if i send error messages

907
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,799
especially if it's an amplification with

908
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,320
error messages larger than the original

909
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
one so think of it as a tiny sin and a

910
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
large thing or whatever so there are

911
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
cases where silently dropping is

912
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
actually better than sending an error

913
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,360
and it has to do with this do i already

914
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,840
have a channel with them okay if so it's

915
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,279
better to send an error message clearly

916
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,480
right at least i can't think of a

917
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,840
counter example meaning and that was the

918
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,519
example you used which i said yeah plus

919
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,919
1 plus 100 right but there's also cases

920
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,240
that you can misapply it to say okay you

921
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
should send an error case in all cases

922
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,519
and therefore open yourselves or the

923
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,120
world to distribute denial of service

924
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,240
attacks that would be the over

925
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
application and that's where i think you

926
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
get some negative reactions right and so

927
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
whenever you see negative reactions look

928
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
for okay what's the corner case that

929
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
somebody has in mind and how do i change

930
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,760
the statement to actually admit that

931
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,679
there's a consideration it's not a 100

932
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,279
case whether it's an often or in the

933
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
following cases or whatever and so i

934
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,559
actually agree with antoine and i agree

935
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
with the way that you phrased it david

936
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
and just making sure the document covers

937
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
both of those that's what i think is a

938
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,159
job of a good iev document is to talk

939
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,440
about both sides and when different

940
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
things are applicable

941
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
because otherwise the community gets

942
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,159
into these fights in every single

943
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,480
working group and so the iab's job is to

944
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,159
write them down once in a way that we

945
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,840
think we can agree with to kind of

946
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,200
preempt

947
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
these debates inside working groups or

948
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
at least give them by the way here's the

949
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,559
way to navigate that if you're a working

950
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,760
group chair for the people that haven't

951
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
heard the documents so that's why i

952
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,919
think that there's actually a really

953
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,679
good thing that the iep document could

954
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,600
do here if it covers these various

955
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
considerations while retaining the main

956
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,039
point of the document here i just think

957
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,240
there's other things that should be put

958
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,679
in there and the title should be changed

959
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
to actually broaden the applicability

960
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,679
of the principles that are in here so

961
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
thanks

962
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,200
thanks dave for like so clearly laying

963
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,880
out all these things no this is super

964
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,719
helpful uh wes is next

965
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,159
uh thank you tommy for giving up your

966
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
seat

967
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,760
so i don't disagree that better guidance

968
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
is needed for implementers right i think

969
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,359
everybody in the room probably thinks

970
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,000
it's time for a document like this and

971
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,879
um

972
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,320
and to specification authors in

973
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,399
particular too right avoid holes that's

974
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,159
that's also i think fairly clear right

975
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
try and cover all the cases but this

976
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,800
document's for when that doesn't happen

977
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
i think the goal of any modern document

978
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
though should be to inform the readers

979
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
of their complete set of choices and and

980
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,440
this document's not written that way as

981
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,639
i said on the mailing list right it

982
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,000
should be twice as long because right

983
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,199
now it's written to attack one viewpoint

984
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,359
and it's written by sort of one corner

985
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,440
of the market too right as brian said a

986
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,679
second ago protocol life titles had life

987
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
cycles have changed

988
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
i'm not sure that's true right if you

989
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,960
look at cpe vendors and router vendors

990
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,880
and switch vendors and stuff

991
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,440
they have struggled to get any deployed

992
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
equipment to be updated right especially

993
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,599
in-home stuff it just doesn't happen

994
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,119
so the market space there has a

995
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,520
completely different viewpoint from

996
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
http you know

997
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,640
implementers that are changing their

998
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
code every nine months or every three

999
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
months excuse me

1000
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
and the other big thing is that closing

1001
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
a connection on garbage may result in

1002
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,839
some devices as taking the entire

1003
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,280
network down

1004
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,200
if you you know if you in your process

1005
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,720
of using say netcom for something to

1006
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,800
configure a router take down an

1007
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,839
interface

1008
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,920
get garbage and then shut the connection

1009
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
down you've just taken down a network

1010
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,359
behind it right so you need those

1011
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,200
rollback and other sorts of mechanisms

1012
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
the other you know important quickly

1013
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
jump in on that one you made a really

1014
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,520
great point there and when when you made

1015
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
it we we did

1016
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
uh and martin

1017
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,960
wrote a section specifically because we

1018
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,040
realized again like dave was saying that

1019
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
there was an enormous yes and the new

1020
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
section is great but the new section

1021
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,160
just

1022
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
specifies this document only applies

1023
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
under these circumstances as opposed to

1024
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,440
helping all sides and writing the other

1025
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
half of the document that helps you know

1026
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,839
so

1027
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,520
i totally agree with the

1028
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,200
clarifying the

1029
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
uh i'm sorry i'm jumping in it's one of

1030
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,560
the costs that's all right uh the

1031
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
the caveats and the

1032
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,240
assumptions that we've made that were

1033
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,640
perhaps implicit um

1034
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
i do agree with you that for the other

1035
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
side of

1036
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,480
like in those cases this doesn't what do

1037
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,839
they do

1038
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,040
i think

1039
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,920
writing a document there could be useful

1040
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
i'm not volunteering to write all that

1041
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
text and i don't think we should block

1042
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,599
writing something on this half until the

1043
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,280
other half is written because that's

1044
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
probably a lot of text and i don't think

1045
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,560
we need to put them both in the same

1046
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
document that'll be putting quite a

1047
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
burden on us editors and

1048
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
so going back to my original statement

1049
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,960
the right thing to do for implementers

1050
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,800
is to have the completely documented set

1051
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
of choices no matter how hard it is i

1052
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,040
agree as i mentioned in mail right it

1053
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
should be twice as long in order to inc

1054
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,359
to incorporate all these

1055
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,640
because there are times you really want

1056
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
to accept data and be flexible and there

1057
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,359
are times you need to abort the

1058
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,480
connection there are times you need to

1059
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
log the error as myria said right but

1060
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,200
then accept more after that

1061
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,760
it's hard to write that generically in

1062
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,119
the first place i mean even the corner

1063
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,480
cases we're talking sort of about two

1064
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
extremes what about the middle grounds

1065
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,880
where

1066
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
in the end you know you actually need to

1067
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,040
give guidance to the user on what the

1068
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,359
different situations are because even in

1069
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
one protocol you may want to do one

1070
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,960
extreme thing in one case and another

1071
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
more flexible thing and another

1072
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,520
depending on what the ramifications of

1073
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,400
that decision are right

1074
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
so

1075
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
writing the document

1076
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,000
in such a way that it started off with

1077
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
in the original version this is bad

1078
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,320
it's just going to set a negative tone

1079
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,960
right as mallory pointed out that title

1080
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,119
still you know has remnants of that

1081
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,040
original discussion even though the rest

1082
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,720
of the document i agree you know has

1083
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,079
gotten better

1084
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,760
but you know for me

1085
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
if if i was going to want to approve

1086
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,000
this i'd want to make sure that the

1087
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
document

1088
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,599
had the best advice like iab normally

1089
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
gives to the entire community not just a

1090
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
section and not just against one

1091
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,760
particular past

1092
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,400
implementation

1093
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,920
thanks uh empty

1094
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,040
no

1095
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,560
we tended together that's hilarious

1096
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,920
thank you for that philosophical insight

1097
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
so um

1098
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
i'm going to partly disagree with dave

1099
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,839
but also agree with him i think this is

1100
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,560
this this is important because

1101
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,880
you um you identified four things i

1102
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
think there's only really three that

1103
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
we're talking about here the the maze

1104
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
insurance and whatnot

1105
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
uh

1106
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,640
the bounds of the protocol that that

1107
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
uh entities interacting with that

1108
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
protocol

1109
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,400
uh are confined by

1110
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,839
and

1111
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,760
the the robustness principle does i

1112
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,800
think apply in those cases where someone

1113
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
steps outside those bounds

1114
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
that's really what we're talking about i

1115
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
don't think that that there is a

1116
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,560
and anytime there's a may in a protocol

1117
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,800
specification that's a must for everyone

1118
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
else so

1119
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,839
um i don't think that's that's really

1120
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,720
a distinct piece in this taxonomy so i

1121
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
want to just sort of exclude that to

1122
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
start with

1123
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
um

1124
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
you're frowning

1125
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
feel free to

1126
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,119
so so when i say if i may send you must

1127
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,200
be prepared to receive type thing

1128
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,359
but it's not always true

1129
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,440
not every bay in a document is about may

1130
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,920
send you said every may is a must for

1131
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,119
somebody else and that's where you lost

1132
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,839
them oh okay so

1133
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,839
um

1134
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,839
yeah there's a lot more to it than that

1135
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,119
i just want to sort of set that aside

1136
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,560
but i think the the point about not

1137
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
crashing uh not exposing yourself to

1138
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,560
security issues is something that we've

1139
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,680
sort of

1140
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,480
allied to the detriment of the document

1141
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
uh and and it's that's something that we

1142
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
need to

1143
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359
need to address full-on

1144
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,720
um

1145
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,879
the

1146
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,400
the whole thing about silent drop and

1147
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,200
whatever else is

1148
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,480
i think

1149
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,359
a little bit of a distraction here to to

1150
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,400
some extent i think the um

1151
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
that the goal of the document is to say

1152
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,680
when you end up when when you end up in

1153
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,079
these situations

1154
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,400
don't do

1155
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
the one thing

1156
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,880
that

1157
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,599
is specified in 1958 or

1158
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,920
worse the its predecessors it's

1159
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,599
find some way

1160
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
to have the entire protocol ecosystem

1161
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,400
agree on what the outcome is and then

1162
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
write that down

1163
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,079
and

1164
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,400
it says that a number of times um it

1165
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,680
probably needs to be sharpened

1166
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,319
something about sharp implements for

1167
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,520
sharp people

1168
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,119
um

1169
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,160
but

1170
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,040
um i i think that's

1171
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,079
that's probably the part that i

1172
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,880
continue to struggle with when

1173
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
i hear comments like where's

1174
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,599
i just can't

1175
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,319
i need i i need help in identifying

1176
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,920
where where's is getting these

1177
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,359
misconceptions

1178
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,640
because it's not what i'm trying to

1179
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
write down

1180
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
and i i didn't think

1181
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
that it ever said anything about

1182
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,839
um

1183
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,480
the the bgp case that's that's been

1184
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,720
talked about right so you receive

1185
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,240
garbage that's been forwarded on to you

1186
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,079
from someone else and somewhere else in

1187
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,520
the network

1188
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,640
and

1189
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,960
you have to deal with the consequences

1190
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,160
of that and you don't want to bring the

1191
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,839
entire network down it's only one

1192
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,480
misbehaving entity somewhere

1193
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,119
remote that that's causing this problem

1194
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,400
um

1195
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,920
thing is

1196
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,839
that has been documented by that

1197
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,200
community and

1198
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,359
it's well specified now and the behavior

1199
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,880
is fairly consistent

1200
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,200
amongst well at least amongst updated

1201
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,040
implementations

1202
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,920
so

1203
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,040
um

1204
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,280
i think there was um

1205
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,359
one other point about update life cycles

1206
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,440
this may be a point of philosophical

1207
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,880
contention

1208
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,520
but it is my assertion that if you're on

1209
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
the internet

1210
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,599
and you don't have some means to

1211
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,000
react to changes in your environment

1212
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,400
or it is a hostile environment

1213
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
if you don't have some sort of immune

1214
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,359
system and ability to evolve

1215
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,599
then eventually

1216
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,920
bad things will happen probably to you

1217
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,040
sometimes

1218
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,319
to to bystanders and

1219
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,040
whether we like it or not

1220
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
in those situations where where people

1221
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
are unable to to update their devices

1222
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,040
they're causing harm to themselves and

1223
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,640
and and others

1224
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,599
uh

1225
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,760
it's not a desirable situation to be in

1226
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,880
even though i recognize that i

1227
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,560
i've got a router that hasn't been

1228
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,880
getting security updates myself

1229
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,760
something have to deal with

1230
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,760
max martin rob

1231
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,800
and just as a time check we want to give

1232
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
room for people to get to the 10 o'clock

1233
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,280
so

1234
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,720
if i close the queue we'll just try to

1235
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,599
go a little bit choppy

1236
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,680
we have brian the cue to have the audio

1237
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
choppy that's good

1238
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
so just a few constant things so broadly

1239
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,599
i think this document's a good document

1240
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,359
i think it's a good idea it's heading in

1241
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,280
the right direction i think it's useful

1242
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,800
for us to be publishing something in

1243
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,079
this area

1244
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,119
um i do i do feel though trying to spin

1245
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,720
it a bit more in a positive way and make

1246
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
it less confrontational i think that

1247
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,440
would help the community so i think

1248
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
that's worth taking the feedback that's

1249
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,079
come in and trying to twist it slightly

1250
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
and it's also clear to me i think that

1251
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,760
some folks in the community are worried

1252
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
that this is going to be used as a tool

1253
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,440
to bash them on and say your protocol is

1254
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,520
wrong blah blah blah and so we need to

1255
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
make sure that that's not the case and

1256
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,280
that's where i have a lot of

1257
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,200
simply with his argument of trying to

1258
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
make this very balanced on the two sides

1259
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,760
and maybe we have you know javascript

1260
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,440
for good parts maybe the robustness

1261
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,119
principle the good parts would be

1262
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,880
helpful of having that sort of thing and

1263
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,520
certainly where there's confusion about

1264
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,040
our different interpretations of the

1265
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,880
robustness principle and i think some

1266
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,680
people think of it as an extensibility

1267
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,359
extensibility mechanism and i don't

1268
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,040
think that's what it's about at all then

1269
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
i think actually why don't we write down

1270
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,480
what we mean

1271
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,920
rather than just re-quoting the

1272
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,359
historical robustness principle why

1273
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,880
don't we actually restate and say these

1274
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,400
are the things that we think are good

1275
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,680
and worth using these are the things

1276
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,280
that we think don't work so well um i

1277
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
agree on the on sort of defining

1278
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,960
extension points in protocols rather

1279
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,440
than just assuming oh let's let's just

1280
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,560
sort of constrain what you're allowed to

1281
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,000
do and anything outside that's just

1282
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,920
accepted and allowed so so i think this

1283
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,520
is i think we want i would like to see

1284
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,640
something published in this area from

1285
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,520
iob

1286
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
and i think having a bit more balanced

1287
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
view would be good and a little bit less

1288
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,480
confrontational

1289
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,599
thanks

1290
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
thanks and and to be clear we

1291
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,040
we are

1292
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
as editors we agree when we're working

1293
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,079
on that um the the documents started off

1294
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,960
as

1295
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,000
confrontational to start to get people

1296
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
excited and to start a discussion and it

1297
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,960
worked

1298
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,640
um and

1299
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,720
it might take we want there to be a

1300
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
little bit of a

1301
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
kind of a catchy start to get people to

1302
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,920
read it because you know most day like

1303
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
ebby documents don't get read but we

1304
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,760
need to soften it even more because

1305
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,680
absolutely our goal isn't to piss anyone

1306
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,880
off our goal is to get people to go oh

1307
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,440
there are many better approaches uh so

1308
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
totally agree yeah just one quick

1309
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,040
comment when this gets published this

1310
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,400
will get read and quoted a lot

1311
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,839
well that that would be great all right

1312
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,000
paul um so i want to reset here because

1313
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,319
i'm really concerned with where the

1314
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,400
beginning of the conversation went which

1315
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,880
was we should be emphasizing sending

1316
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,560
error responses more

1317
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,920
um well but people have been saying

1318
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,599
that's what we should be you know

1319
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,680
emphasizing the not dropping but sending

1320
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,400
back error error responses and i i have

1321
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,160
a concern because

1322
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,720
somebody who sent you a message thought

1323
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,880
it was reasonable a reasonable message

1324
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,680
to send so they aren't really expecting

1325
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,119
an error response even though it's in

1326
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,119
the protocol they probably could accept

1327
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,880
it that doesn't mean they're going to

1328
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,800
understand it one thing we've certainly

1329
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
seen in some of the older protocols like

1330
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,760
dns

1331
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,400
is

1332
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,160
that

1333
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,000
once people start to under you know like

1334
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,520
like the error messages we're supposed

1335
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,599
to tell you this and this but

1336
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,160
more and more creative errors

1337
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
get the same error response and

1338
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,880
therefore the error responses over time

1339
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,200
become less and less useful

1340
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,240
um

1341
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,760
and so

1342
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,319
pretty much and even quite frankly in

1343
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,319
hdp the error responses are

1344
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,280
limited and therefore

1345
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,520
the people who are receiving them aren't

1346
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,760
necessarily able to act on them in the

1347
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,560
way that we want in this document namely

1348
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,319
to have people

1349
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,280
not sending things that cause errors

1350
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,119
um

1351
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,760
so i think that a thing that could be

1352
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,119
brought up in the send back errors or

1353
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,960
thing in in the section in the document

1354
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,880
is that errors themselves should be

1355
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,480
extensible

1356
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,760
that is

1357
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,200
um

1358
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,599
as new in the same way we have

1359
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,319
extensibility points usually for

1360
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,480
adding things to the protocol

1361
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,200
errors should be extensible as well as a

1362
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,800
way of making

1363
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,760
it you know and quite frankly i think

1364
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,400
private use error messages are a great

1365
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
thing i know this is like i get beaten

1366
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,920
up on this a bunch but it allows greater

1367
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,160
flexibility for the receiver to say

1368
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,960
i got an error and it doesn't fit into

1369
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,119
exactly what the protocol authors

1370
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,200
thought

1371
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,599
thanks and honestly i agree with

1372
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,359
everything you just said

1373
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,160
uh deborah

1374
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,520
deborah are you there

1375
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,559
okay

1376
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,040
we hear you

1377
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,359
there is a delay

1378
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,400
um

1379
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,240
as i've said on the list

1380
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,960
the tone of the document

1381
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,160
by making a blatant statement

1382
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,640
that the postal

1383
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,280
right is harmful

1384
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
i think it's just

1385
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,640
overboard and you're and that is why

1386
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,319
you're not able to get your message

1387
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,160
across

1388
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,880
there's there's no

1389
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,280
you know buddy against having

1390
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,000
advice on how to do better protocol

1391
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,440
development

1392
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,040
but you're

1393
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,359
to put that interpretation into postal

1394
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,760
it's totally incorrect it's not

1395
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,480
what postal has been saying

1396
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,960
and as you've already like been saying

1397
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,960
here every protocol is different

1398
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,160
and you may not want to put 100 pages in

1399
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,319
your document but then you have to tone

1400
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,160
it down

1401
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,280
that this is not applicable for

1402
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
for every protocol and what you really

1403
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,559
want is that people are rigorous

1404
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,400
in the specification writing

1405
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,400
so

1406
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,960
but i i there's been a huge mixture and

1407
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,640
the audio is bad

1408
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,680
and i think there's a huge

1409
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,000
um

1410
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,800
lack of understanding that everybody

1411
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,119
uses terms differently

1412
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,480
for example protocol deployment is that

1413
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,480
demo code

1414
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,760
is it in a production network

1415
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,960
for maintenance are you talking about

1416
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,040
bug fixes

1417
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,839
are you talking about upgrades major

1418
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,480
there's a huge difference

1419
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,520
in operational reality

1420
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,119
so that's but it would really help

1421
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,839
if the tone of the document was not this

1422
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,720
negativity on

1423
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,680
po on postal and that that i would

1424
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,800
really

1425
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,760
is concerned about

1426
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,160
thank you debra

1427
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,480
um so just to clarify one thing uh

1428
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,800
pastel's name does not appear in the

1429
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,280
document apart from in the references

1430
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,880
section as one as the author on rfc 760.

1431
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,359
uh so we're we're not saying anything

1432
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,079
about i know though a very early version

1433
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,200
of this draft said postal was wrong but

1434
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,839
we've toned it down we've got

1435
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,000
for and it's the document is much better

1436
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,559
now it got that flashy thing that got

1437
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,400
people to the table but yeah um and so i

1438
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,720
i see what you're saying

1439
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,800
yeah go ahead you still have that it's

1440
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,040
the robustness principle

1441
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,240
and that we all know it's postal

1442
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,040
you can go to the internet

1443
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,920
society's website the description of the

1444
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,079
postal award

1445
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,960
cites the robustness principle

1446
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,079
i would love to see if you publish this

1447
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,040
document that his

1448
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,359
principle is harmful

1449
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,640
go to the internet society and have them

1450
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,280
change their web page

1451
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,839
okay all right thank you okay

1452
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,839
just for time for time we we do have a

1453
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,040
couple more people in queue and so i

1454
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,480
think we should just take like a minute

1455
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,720
on each person and then wrap up so let's

1456
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,480
try to get through this all right thanks

1457
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,680
debra uh dkg

1458
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,760
grab a mic please for the remote

1459
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,240
folks switch

1460
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,000
and press the button

1461
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,359
big button okay this is daniel kahn

1462
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,240
gilmore um so this document does two

1463
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,319
things right it provides guidance to

1464
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,000
protocol designers and it provides

1465
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,839
guidance to implementers

1466
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,359
and the robustness principle is

1467
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,720
sometimes thought to apply to one and

1468
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,880
sometimes thought to apply to the other

1469
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,640
or to both and i actually think it's

1470
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
subtly different and it's important that

1471
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,760
it's different for the protocol

1472
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,480
designers and the implementers

1473
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,160
and we are making a mistake when we

1474
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,480
apply the the robustness principle to

1475
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,800
the protocol design because it does have

1476
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,920
all the deleterious effects for

1477
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,280
interoperability that the document

1478
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,040
rightly calls out

1479
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,319
so what the document actually says to

1480
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,800
protocol designers is don't leave wiggle

1481
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,760
room in your protocol be clear about

1482
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,160
where things should be uh rejected or

1483
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,119
whatever

1484
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,960
i'm not going to go into too much detail

1485
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,559
on the like sending errors back there

1486
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,839
are a lot of cases where we can't afford

1487
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,559
to send errors back

1488
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,839
but i think the document could do a

1489
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,680
better job of calling out what the

1490
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,280
robustness principle means for each of

1491
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,960
these two categories the protocol

1492
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,040
designers and the implementers right and

1493
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,880
it should actually say that implementers

1494
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,960
if you find yourself having to apply the

1495
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,119
this robustness principle

1496
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,520
because the spec is ambiguous

1497
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,280
please help us improve the spec

1498
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,000
thanks that's great uh miriam yeah that

1499
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,440
makes my comment very short because i

1500
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,640
wanted to say the same thing i think

1501
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,640
like we should this is very clear for

1502
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,800
protocol um specification we should do

1503
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,119
exactly what stuart also said earlier

1504
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,559
and there should be no wiggle room and

1505
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,000
that's the most important message of

1506
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,760
this document

1507
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,720
um

1508
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,040
and about deployment parts um you know

1509
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,119
if it's not well specified then there's

1510
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,559
a question what you do

1511
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,480
and i disagree with wes that's where i

1512
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,160
joined the queue um because i don't

1513
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,440
think i want to want a document that's

1514
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,800
very long and talks about all the

1515
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,480
different options i think the message

1516
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,000
here is also that like

1517
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,920
silently drop is not always the best

1518
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,240
option so that's a big message and i

1519
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,240
actually think iab documents are best

1520
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,480
when they are short and give like a very

1521
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,640
clear short statement so i'm i don't

1522
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,000
think we should like cover the whole

1523
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,520
space here

1524
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,920
thanks totally agree tommy go ahead and

1525
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,359
i'd like to take a minute after you did

1526
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,680
that that's fine to conclude um

1527
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,799
i i

1528
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,000
i got in the queue partly just to

1529
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,079
provide a comment as i was listening to

1530
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,640
these things as a suggestion maybe to

1531
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
you know particularly the title and how

1532
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,520
we phrase the whole thing um

1533
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,960
i kind of see two

1534
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,520
possibilities like one is

1535
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,359
it's too long but like you could call

1536
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,960
like interpreting the robustness

1537
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,640
principle in a world of protocol

1538
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,200
maintenance like essentially saying like

1539
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
when you have protocol maintenance or

1540
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,879
like maintained protocol deployments

1541
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,799
here's how to think about the robustness

1542
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,400
principle and here's how it applies and

1543
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,000
another way to do it would be because

1544
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,160
there have been many statements of the

1545
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
robustness principle another thing you

1546
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,119
could just do is

1547
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,240
try to

1548
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,920
restate it to add a bit more nuance

1549
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,160
to some of these cases or to just make

1550
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,799
it more clear

1551
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,559
that i think if you go that direction it

1552
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,920
gets into the more like now you need to

1553
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,839
talk about all the different edge cases

1554
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,240
and so potentially scoping it down

1555
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,640
would just be about saying here is how

1556
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,920
you should use

1557
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,799
the robustness principle

1558
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,520
in this type of deployment and

1559
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,400
understand like no it's not as simple as

1560
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,799
just being liberal

1561
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:55,760
thanks

1562
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
all right so first off i want to thank

1563
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,040
everyone who came over and who

1564
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,839
participated

1565
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,720
i am like impressed at how much more

1566
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,640
productive this was than the on this

1567
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,680
discussion uh the phrase i heard the

1568
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,200
most today was i agree with you yes and

1569
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,599
um and that was great because seriously

1570
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,839
we got really useful feedback

1571
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,160
that like sometimes on the list i was

1572
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,920
like having a hard time understanding

1573
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,079
what people wanted us to change

1574
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,160
and now this is like very actionable

1575
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,440
changes that we can make to this

1576
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,720
document

1577
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,720
and so in a way because everyone has

1578
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,480
been saying like this is useful let's

1579
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,640
tweak it to publish it

1580
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,280
not like no no go away so we're gonna

1581
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,880
take that back we're gonna make those

1582
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,839
edits

1583
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,920
and i think we're gonna improve it quite

1584
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,359
a bit based on this feedback so thank

1585
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,119
you so much everyone this was a really

1586
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,599
great conversation

1587
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,880
thank you

1588
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,359
have a good thursday

1589
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,119
