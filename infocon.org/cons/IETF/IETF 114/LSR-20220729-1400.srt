i think i'm ready let's let's see

15
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,119
chat room

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,439
all right so good morning everyone this

17
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
is the lsr working group

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
we've got a two-hour session

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
i think yeah

20
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
here's our note well you've been seeing

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,679
all week long hopefully

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
basically says that by participating you

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
agree to follow all the process and

24
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
policies

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
and everything else there on that slide

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
um oh yeah let me go back so um

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799

28
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,280
masking please wear your mask unless

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
you're talking at the mic

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,330
um

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,760
[Music]

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
or consuming water i guess because

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
you're tired

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,958
vocal cords from talking all week

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
i don't think that there's oh yeah and

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
when you if you're going to go to the

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
mic please oh well in any case please

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
sign into the on-site tool

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
um

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
that's what's going it's you can find it

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
on the agenda it's one of the buttons to

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,599
the right

43
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,760
and that will uh record your presence

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
instead of doing the old

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
signing the blue sheet thing

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,280
and in that tool you can

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
select the hand

48
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
icon if you want to go into the queue

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
so that way we can manage the remote and

50
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
local queue fairly

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
uh i think that that is all the

52
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
administrivia

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
um ac do you want to do the slides the

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
status now

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,840
yes

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
uh next slide

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,959
i'm just

58
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
well while i'm doing all of this status

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
i'm just going to point out the salient

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
uh drafts because i want to leave as

61
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
much time for the presentations and

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
discussions

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
next slide

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,760
here this is this is uh

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
this is uh there's been a development

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
here

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
rfc

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,519
9127 has uh will soon go

69
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
off 48 so once you know once that's

70
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
published it'll unblock the ospf and

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
isis yang models and once we do that i

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,319
think in the next months we're working

73
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,760
on

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,640
uh

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,599
resurrecting interest in the follow-on

76
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
the you know the yang models based on

77
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,799
this

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,159
i know

79
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
a lot of us that were working on yang

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
models weren't interested in doing

81
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,519
anything as long as we were waiting for

82
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,640
this

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,879
next slide

84
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
okay this is this this one's still

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
waiting on the flex algo we'll cover

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
that later next slide

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
these are the giraffes completed last

88
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
call we really need the flex algo done

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
because not only is there references to

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
it in a lot of the sr drafts there's

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
also a lot of our fault

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
you'll see that today a lot of the

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
working group documents that we have are

94
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
based on this so this is really a

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
foundational work that we need to get

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,759
to the isg and published

97
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
next slide

98
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,159
next slide

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,520
uh

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,159
next slide

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
uh this this extensions for srv6 this is

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
ready i've reviewed it once they

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
incorporated my comments

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
we're going uh if there's an

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
i think uh at least i'm pretty sure i

106
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
think i've heard i've heard it second

107
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
party but i've heard huawei has

108
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,520
implementations of this draft so we're

109
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
going to do a

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
last call shortly after

111
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,160
the

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
ietf114

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,639
oh and there's also uh references in

114
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
drafts and other working groups to this

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
draft

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,880
next slide

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,680
uh

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
next slide

119
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
oh no stay stay here oh all right

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
uh dynamic flooding for dense graphs the

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
working group did a lot of work on this

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
it's

123
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
i i say implementations proceeding this

124
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
is kind of slowed down and there's been

125
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
a lot for one reason or another the

126
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,080
implementations there's one

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
implementation of it

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
we talked about the offers and we're

129
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
thinking of targeting experimental and

130
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
publishing it now a lot of drafts in lsr

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
and this is this phenomenon is not

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
unique to the lsr working group but a

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
lot of drafts in ls and lsr nobody's

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
really interested in them but the offers

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,360
this was this was one of those

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
exceptions we had a lot of interest

137
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,520
across the whole working group for the

138
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
dynamic flooding and i think i think

139
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
it's a real priority at this time people

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
can disagree with me on the list if they

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
want but next slide

142
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
fast flooding is another one where we

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
add interest across the working group

144
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
i'm going to be

145
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,039
uh

146
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,039
talking to the or

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
chris and i'll be talking to the offers

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,479
and seeing when they feel that rich

149
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
ready for a working group last call i

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
know that bruno just did another

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,639
very incremental update

152
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
and um i will uh

153
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
uh

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
it would be good if people would look at

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
that again

156
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
next slide

157
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,319
i believe

158
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
those were the only ones i really wanted

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
to talk about

160
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
in the status next slide

161
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
next slide

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
okay we're targeting

163
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,440
interim around

164
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
september 7th

165
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
that drafts don't make

166
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
the for drafts that didn't make the

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
agenda now one thing about this we have

168
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
these drafts now and i've seen some

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
discussion on some of these drafts and

170
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
it looks like some of these rafts may be

171
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
uh unnecessary so

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,879
we're not going to have presentations

173
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
uh we're going to try and

174
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
at least read these drafts or dra or

175
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
presentations on drafts that are

176
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
definitely

177
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
uh unnecessary anyway but that's the

178
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
time we're uh

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
targeting

180
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
okay

181
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,758
i'm done

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
um

184
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
let me see if i can

185
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,479
share

186
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
no chairs

187
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,479
all the spots oh i gotta close the

188
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,279
presentation i think

189
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,120
there we go

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
um so uh just uh putting the

191
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,600
agenda up here in case anyone wanted to

192
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
bash it um we just went through one uh

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,000
number two is cancelled

194
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
and

195
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
we have uh

196
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,640
we're gonna push to get all the way

197
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,199
through nine

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
in the allotted time

199
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,640
uh

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
but we wanted to leave time for

201
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
discussion so

202
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,480
everything else is dependent

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
we might be able to get to these if we

204
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
have time

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
but if not this is what ac was talking

206
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
about these plus anything new like

207
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
oh

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
yeah look at that

209
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,240
was it up was it ever up

210
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
no okay

211
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
yeah

212
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
it's well

213
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
it's funny because i can see it

214
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,640
you can see them here we go

215
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
no i screwed up user error

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,160
so

217
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,320
right so here's the agenda and then

218
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
we're gonna get to nine and then

219
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
anything after if we have time otherwise

220
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
those move to the interim

221
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,319
and with that let's uh

222
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
let's move to the

223
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
oslo

224
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
chris i actually wanted to

225
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
ask a question

226
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,640
yes

227
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
go ahead les

228
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
so

229
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
if i can say this in a friendly way i

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
think um

231
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
we haven't progressed

232
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
any of the documents that have gone

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
through last call in quite a while

234
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
and um i'm just wondering if there's

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
you know we can get some update on that

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
if there's some way to get

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,279
additional

238
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
resources put on that

239
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
are you speaking of things that have

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
again gone to the iesg or things that

241
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
are in working group last call

242
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,240
i'm really speaking of things that are

243
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
in the ads hands uh sorry john

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
john that's the mic so that's why i was

245
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
asking

246
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
nope nope no offense taken less it's a

247
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,839
perfectly valid question

248
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,920
um so i've communicated this to the

249
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,880
chairs already uh but uh all the authors

250
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,399
deserve

251
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,640
some uh you know communication too

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
my my q is pretty severely backlogged

253
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
i'm

254
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
have taken

255
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
several steps to let me get through it

256
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,720
faster

257
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,959
it will take a while for those to

258
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
actually show up

259
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,920
on your dashboards and in

260
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
terms of results uh i'm

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
not generally a person that likes making

262
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
excuses i like showing results instead

263
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
but it will take a while for the results

264
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,399
to

265
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
actually start appearing um

266
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,440
in terms of what you can do to help

267
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
if i think of anything

268
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
i will surely let you know

269
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
um i wish i had

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
something more to tell you but that's

271
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
what i got i'm i'm you know i'm all ears

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
if if uh you know

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
you've got ideas uh i don't know if we

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
want to take up agenda time on that or

275
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
not i leave that to chris

276
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
no here here's a here's a real quick

277
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
quick one from me speaking as working

278
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
with chair

279
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
i think

280
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,880
that a timely review

281
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
would be that is

282
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,079
less extensive would be preferred

283
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,600
to one like

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
four months out

285
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
that's my uh or four to six months out

286
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
and i believe you know it's already been

287
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
through the working group we have the

288
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
people in this working group who have

289
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
implemented these protocols

290
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
uh maybe we need to if like i know i

291
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
know at least some of the drafts we

292
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
don't get everybody to review them but

293
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,439
that's that's just my opinion

294
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
uh that is fair um one of the things

295
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
that i try to focus on when i'm doing a

296
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,519
review

297
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
is hitting things that i'm fairly sure

298
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
that will you know are going to trigger

299
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,120
other iesg members anyway so i'd rather

300
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,279
they trigger me than

301
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
trigger you know a disgust from somebody

302
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
else down the line

303
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,160
but

304
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
yes um

305
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,880
quick and timely and then getting

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
through the discussions might be

307
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
preferable to waiting forever um i hear

308
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,519
you

309
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,800
les are you happy with that

310
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
yeah yeah i mean it's a friendly

311
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
question but i think i think

312
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
and i have a lot of respect for john and

313
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
for

314
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
how much work it takes to be an ad but

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
somehow

316
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,279
i think we we need to make some progress

317
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,440
okay

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,240
well

319
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,000
les you're on the mic

320
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
still and i think you're presenting now

321
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,519
so let me get rid of my screen

322
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,120
and then

323
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,800
click the little icon next to you

324
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
that's interesting do you get to pick

325
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,959
apparently

326
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
yeah so

327
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,000
pick asla or

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
that

329
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
that works

330
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
yup

331
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
okay

332
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,079
so this is an update on

333
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,880
the two bis drafts for

334
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,439
asla for iss and ospf

335
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
here's the bit of history

336
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
about a year ago

337
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,639
there was uh some discussion on the list

338
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
that there was some confusion

339
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,680
uh regarding uh

340
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,639
the specification of how zero length

341
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,440
uh abm advertisements were used there's

342
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,199
a pointer to

343
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
the thread

344
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
the outcome of that discussion was

345
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,839
an errata for each of the rfcs

346
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,639
in may john reviewed the errata and felt

347
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,440
that

348
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
it would be more appropriate to pursue

349
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
this as abyss rfc

350
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,880
so we published uh

351
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
the best drafts in

352
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
june

353
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
we got some additional comments from

354
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,600
bruno and shraddha

355
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
beyond what had been

356
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
written in the errata we've incorporated

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
those

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
this is not a complete set of diffs this

359
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
is just a quick summary of the

360
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
significant changes

361
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
we specified

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
we clarified that

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
for the srte application that this is

364
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,639
data point independent

365
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,880
it applies to srm pls and srv6

366
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
that was input from shrada

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,680
we clarified

368
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,719
the use of the

369
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,639
zero length

370
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
abms

371
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,800
the l bit

372
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
these are essentially things that came

373
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
out of the original errata

374
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,839
and we also clarified that would we have

375
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
legacy routers in the network who are

376
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
only going to be using legacy

377
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
advertisements that we must not only

378
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
continue to advertise legacy

379
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,199
but we must not advertise asla

380
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,839
because the legacy routers will not

381
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,320
be looking at those there was another

382
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,040
request from shraddha

383
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,240
so

384
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
next steps there's no substantive

385
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
changes here there's only clarifications

386
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
so i would really like to fast track

387
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,160
this and

388
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
i haven't discussed this with the

389
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,759
working group chairs but

390
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,000
this is the plan that i have in mind i'd

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,319
like to see these both bits drafts

392
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
immediately adopted

393
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,280
i'd like to get last call within

394
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,160
one ietf cycle by the next

395
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,439
meeting

396
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
and i know john has

397
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,439
graciously

398
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,679
volunteered to try to

399
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,319
speed the isg review by constraining it

400
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
just to the changes not to

401
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
reviewing the entire contents of the

402
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
original rfcs

403
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
and john i'll certainly take you up on

404
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
that

405
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
i hope we can do that

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,559
and that's it

407
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,760
okay um

408
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
oh goodness i was gonna ask the room a

409
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
question but now i need to do this

410
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
differently

411
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
uh

412
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
i'm gonna do a

413
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
raise hands thing to see

414
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,919
if anybody objects to going immediately

415
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,320
the adoption call in this

416
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
if i can find

417
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
thank you chair

418
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,719
this is why you do the thing

419
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
okay

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,799
show of hands there we go

421
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
any objection

422
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,160
to immediate

423
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
adoption

424
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,159
all right so

425
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
there we have a

426
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
go ahead and click

427
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
so raising

428
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
raising hand means you object or you

429
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
don't object

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
raising hands means you object

431
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,919
so don't raise your hand and we'll

432
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,280
go to immediate adoption

433
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,760
it will also

434
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
yeah

435
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,678
i don't it seemed to have ended on me

436
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
well there was 20 oh that it says

437
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
there's 21 participants and 21 didn't

438
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
raise their hand

439
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
i don't know why but it's 21 and as soon

440
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,640
as it hit the mat the number it just

441
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
stopped for the tool

442
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,960
i guess that's a consensus

443
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,679
yeah if any i'll give a few uh just

444
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,600
another moment here if anybody wants to

445
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
get in the queue if they object

446
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,120
yeah i'm not getting in the queue to

447
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
object i'm just getting in the queue to

448
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
say i mean you you you could do the show

449
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
of hands thing again but i think you

450
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
also

451
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
have um

452
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,720
discretion as chairs to just do this if

453
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,799
you yeah yeah yeah i i was just getting

454
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
the feel for the um

455
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,679
i don't i don't have i don't think that

456
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
we're going to see any objections okay

457
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,720
all right

458
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
thank you les

459
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
i think that we will do that then

460
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
unless we hear something in the back

461
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
channel where somebody anonymously

462
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
didn't want to talk

463
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
who knows

464
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
i can't imagine why

465
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
all right

466
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,919
so next up

467
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,039
is

468
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
chung

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,880
uh using isis multi topology okay so

470
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,840
who's going

471
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,919
first actually actually i thought we

472
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
they had one slot for the two uh

473
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,200
the two vtn

474
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
uh drafts

475
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
they did but they have they have two

476
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,439
presenters okay

477
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,600
you have uh

478
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120
you have a control so pick the

479
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,520
presentation you're presenting

480
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
and run uh

481
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,200
yeah i will try to control the slides

482
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,559
can you help me to control the slice

483
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
yeah so when i you should see a list of

484
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
slides available yeah on your screen

485
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,080
yeah pic pick your presentation and then

486
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
you'll have control

487
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
okay

488
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
there we go

489
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
okay thank you

490
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
uh

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
hello everyone

492
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
this presentation about

493
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,640
using ssmt multi-topology for second

494
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,240
routing with vtn

495
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
yeah

496
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,320
vt is a virtual analytic network with

497
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,640
the required topology and results

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,320
characteristics

499
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
and it could be used only to meet the

500
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,799
requirements of one or

501
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
a group of weekend plus services you

502
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,559
know in a contest network slicing

503
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,480
this concept is similar to the network

504
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,080
resource partition defined in in this

505
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
draft

506
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,919
uh furthermore uh the results were said

507
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,080
uh replace different sites of resources

508
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
allocated

509
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
on network segments for uh packet

510
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
processing

511
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
and uh

512
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
so with srbs data plane sig can be used

513
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
to replace the both topology

514
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
instructions

515
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
and the network and the network

516
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,240
resources allocated by network loads to

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
a vtm

518
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
so this document describes the

519
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,799
mechanisms of applying much topology to

520
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,600
build sr based regions

521
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
and

522
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,120
it is applicable to networks

523
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
where the required number of vtn is

524
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,678
small

525
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
uh

526
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,360
isis multi topology routing is used to

527
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
create a dependent topology in my

528
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
network

529
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,280
so

530
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,520
empty-based trvas

531
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,679
are introduced to carry topology

532
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,000
specific link state information

533
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
this provides the capability of specific

534
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,600
specifying the customized attributes of

535
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
each topology

536
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
when each type of reaching is associated

537
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,679
with the dependent network topology

538
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,120
uh mit id uh multiple id could be used

539
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,400
as a identifier of vtn control planes so

540
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
i'm

541
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,039
um empty routing can be used with

542
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,760
isr-based display

543
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
you want to perform a construct-based

544
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
path computation for each beating on the

545
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
network controller of the increased

546
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,240
nodes the network resource attributes

547
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,080
and other attributes associated with

548
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
utility

549
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,279
can be a little bit highest

550
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,760
for multi topology network uh topology

551
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
specific

552
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,960
as a

553
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
mpsc osr

554
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,039
v6 location can be

555
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,000
advertised based on assets eisen as a

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
basic intentions

557
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,640
uh

558
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,919
specific link binaries advertised all

559
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,440
four different ratings other idt

560
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
attributes may also be advertised in

561
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
topology specific manner

562
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,559
since this document was adopted

563
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,919
last year

564
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,279
several

565
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,200
updates have been made

566
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
for the comments received we clarified

567
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
that both

568
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,120
uh results aware say that normal state

569
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
can be used with this mechanism to build

570
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
srbs retains

571
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,720
and then we also

572
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
publish the text about the forwarding

573
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
plane's operations

574
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
in the

575
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
we describe the scalability

576
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
considerations and the target network

577
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,559
scenarios

578
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,200
and also um and ethereum chain has also

579
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,799
been made

580
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,120
um

581
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,559
implementations

582
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
uh show that this mechanism

583
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,559
works well

584
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,360
and

585
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
the content of the document

586
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
looks stable

587
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
so we think that it is ready for working

588
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,240
group nascar

589
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
when the more reviews and comments are

590
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
well comes

591
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
as usual

592
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
so i'm done thank you

593
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,919
all right we have two people in the

594
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,279
queue last year up first

595
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,559
so

596
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,240
um

597
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,559
there was a discussion when this

598
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
draft was was up for working group

599
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
adoption

600
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
um that it didn't have really have any

601
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,919
significant content

602
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,279
uh but we adopted it anyways but

603
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,360
the the only way that this the content

604
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,440
of this draft is meaningful is if the

605
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
working group actually takes on the work

606
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,279
of supporting vtn or

607
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,520
vpn plus whatever name you want to give

608
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
it and we have not done that yet

609
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
so at a minimum this draft should not

610
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
progress

611
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,200
until the working group takes on

612
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
the vtn actual vtn extensions

613
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
and decides to move that forward which

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
we may or may not do

615
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
so i strongly object to moving this to

616
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,520
last call

617
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,320
okay ac

618
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,600
uh yes

619
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,880
ac linum cisco systems i think that uh

620
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
why would we take this to working group

621
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,559
glass call

622
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
when the drafts it's depended on because

623
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,520
this is kind of an after the fact the

624
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,440
resource aware sids and the tease draft

625
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,559
aren't

626
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,158
uh in working group last call

627
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
i mean i don't know why we jump this up

628
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,000
just because it's a very simple draft

629
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
when those aren't uh

630
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
when when when those things aren't uh

631
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,520
aren't done

632
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
well there's nefarious reasons to do

633
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
that kind of a thing but

634
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,679
i think we could just wait right

635
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,679
yeah that's two people have now said

636
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,760
that

637
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
we'll take this we'll take this

638
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
discussion to the list but i i don't see

639
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,080
i don't see a reason you know it's kind

640
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
of like doing uh

641
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,200
uh

642
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,799
bg pls extensions before the base

643
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,840
specification is done

644
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,159
can you hear me

645
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,960
yep

646
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
yeah yeah i just like to say that uh

647
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
firstly this is a informational document

648
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
and uh

649
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
as we

650
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,559
follow the suggestions

651
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,480
after the adoption we have made the

652
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
resource awareness is

653
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
optional for this document so that we

654
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
can allow both resource versus and

655
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
normalcy's to to be used within this

656
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
mechanism to build the srbs vtns so it

657
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,679
does not rely or depend on the

658
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,880
resource of our segment draft actually

659
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,760
and

660
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
what i want to say that

661
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,279
i just want to

662
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,679
ask maybe ac to help clarify which

663
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
document we need to wait for before this

664
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,960
one i i mean i'm i'm not i mean i read

665
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,120
the document again but what about the

666
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,080
work in ts to define what a btn is

667
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
is that done is that

668
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,919
is that is that on the editor queue or

669
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,520
where is that

670
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,279
i mean on the i on the

671
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,919
adq or where is the vtn the whole vtn

672
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,480
concept where is that document yeah that

673
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,600
is in the vpn class framework and we

674
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,039
have planned to make that one go to last

675
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,399
call uh maybe after this item meeting

676
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,039
okay yeah when that goes so call

677
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,520
come back

678
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
okay so these two need to move forward

679
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,918
together with me

680
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
yes we do we don't want to produce work

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,080
in this working group that refers to

682
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
work that isn't done you know that's

683
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
based on something that isn't done

684
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
somewhere else right

685
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
i mean it's just pretty natural to

686
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,240
progress things in the correct order

687
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,279
okay

688
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,520
it's not a i don't think that anybody's

689
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,120
saying that this wouldn't progress

690
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,200
normally as long as everything goes the

691
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
way it should but you know

692
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,799
let's do things in the right order

693
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
okay okay understand

694
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,399
uh okay

695
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,840
did you want to talk or are you

696
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,039
yeah uh

697
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,120
you can address a quick comment or

698
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,679
rather a suggestion to the authors

699
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,720
there isn't anything which changes igp

700
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,360
uh mechanism or protocol operations in

701
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,159
the draft it's only informational

702
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,679
there is a similar draft in spring which

703
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
covers i would say about 50 to 60

704
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,000
percent of the similar content

705
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
my suggestion to the authors is why

706
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,760
don't you just move everything from this

707
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,919
draft into the spring draft and then

708
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,600
this draft is not required anymore

709
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,640
uh

710
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
okay

711
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,600
the draft which is adopted in spring

712
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,679
uh you know uh you can just roll

713
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,039
everything from here into that

714
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
uh i'm not sure that was uh related to

715
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,320
igp extension or it's just a letter

716
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
it's an architect it's an architecture

717
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,880
it's more architecture description which

718
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,799
is similar to this there is just

719
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,480
architecture and description

720
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,880
just informational uh you can just roll

721
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,039
the sections in into that and i guess

722
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,720
but i mean i'll leave it to the chairs

723
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
as well but just a second yeah i mean

724
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,080
i mean for the igp extensions they we

725
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,519
really don't want to put all those

726
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,679
springs i mean we've kept them here

727
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,679
or the other sr stuff i don't think we

728
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,320
want to do that

729
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,480
anyway we can take that

730
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,519
so we have the next room

731
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
we have two presentations

732
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,440
this first one doesn't have any uh

733
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,840
extensions in it right so i guess that's

734
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
something it should at least be looked

735
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
at

736
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,799
to see if it makes sense

737
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,720
right i guess it doesn't have to mention

738
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,799
yeah this one may i i guess that's i

739
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,559
guess i'd be all right with that

740
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,799
true

741
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,000
uh gets a wider spread then too since

742
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
this is really about how to do things

743
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,919
right it's just informational okay well

744
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,080
let's let's there's only

745
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,519
six minutes left for the other one why

746
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,200
don't we do that one is that going to be

747
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,840
g is that are you presenting that

748
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,519
oh yes i'm the next one

749
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,279
we've got some odd icons

750
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
the same thing is

751
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,559
um

752
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,720
i see i have to actually cancel the

753
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,679
countdown timer to get access to the

754
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,000
okay

755
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
all right you should have uh

756
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,240
a list of presentations in front of you

757
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600
okay

758
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,640
okay can i see this slide

759
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
yes

760
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,720
okay

761
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,519
so this is a update about the

762
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,760
draft i'm using the flash algo for the

763
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,240
segment routing based uh vtn i'm

764
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,159
presenting on behalf of the co-authors

765
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,159
here

766
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,120
first uh about the background i think

767
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,000
this is similar to the previous one

768
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,720
this document is uh describes a

769
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
mechanism of applying the flex algo to

770
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,600
build srvtns

771
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,159
okay the bad result in this draft is uh

772
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,960
when the hvt is associated with an

773
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,000
independent flash algo the flash algo id

774
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,640
can be reused as a identifier of the vt

775
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,159
in the control plane

776
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,640
and we can use the flex algo to describe

777
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,919
the topology constraints of the vtn

778
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,679
it can be applied to

779
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,080
either the default topology or it can be

780
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,320
applied to a multi topology

781
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,799
and with the same routine flash algo

782
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,039
extensions uh algorithm specific srcs

783
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,640
can be advertised

784
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,480
based on the rfc

785
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,600
8667 and as a draft for the iss srv6

786
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,679
extensions

787
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,120
here we make some minor extensions to

788
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,559
use flash algo together with l2 bundle

789
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,799
to advertise the t attributes associated

790
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,960
with different obtains

791
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,800
and we have the details in the following

792
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,200
slides

793
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,320
so

794
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,719
a clarifying question or you're just

795
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,879
getting in early to talk oh there you

796
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,199
are

797
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,359
joel halpern this is related to a

798
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,399
question i asked in six man

799
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,639
and have asked in other contexts but

800
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,000
it's very important here

801
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,079
this sorry i realized joel halpern from

802
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,119
erickson

803
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,639
the

804
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,839
there are two different notions that get

805
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
mixed up and i hope we can clarify which

806
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,760
one this is talking about

807
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,719
there vtn in general is a concept i

808
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,119
don't care there's flex algo which gives

809
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,280
you a topology and a forwarding path and

810
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,119
that's flex algo

811
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,839
and then there has been a discussion of

812
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,720
what is in tease called nrp network

813
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
resource partition

814
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,599
we were very careful and explicit in the

815
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,880
teas work

816
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,920
to say this does not create a separate

817
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,040
topology you you can have multiple

818
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,560
nrps within the same topology

819
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
so that things will scale because we

820
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
don't want to blow up the number of

821
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,000
topologies

822
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
because lots of topologies has all sorts

823
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
of cost

824
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,640
this seems to say

825
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
that if the vtm needs different

826
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
resources

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,440
then that will be a separate topology

828
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,839
and that would be painful we need to be

829
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
able to say this is the resource

830
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
behavior

831
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,480
a resource behavior b resource behavior

832
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,280
c

833
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,880
within the shared common topology one

834
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,599
i'm unclear from these slides and i did

835
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
not have time to review the draft

836
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,359
as to whether that is supported by this

837
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,400
yeah

838
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,520
joe maybe you can check this uh slice at

839
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,160
the bottom we say that this mechanism is

840
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,359
applicable

841
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,160
to networks which requires a small

842
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,880
number of vtns so that

843
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
even if each vt is associated with a

844
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,160
separate topology of las argo the

845
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
scalability will be

846
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,359
acceptable

847
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,800
so this can

848
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
with this mechanism we can make some

849
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,960
simplification to the control plane and

850
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,520
the data plane so that we

851
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,640
can reuse something existed already so

852
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
this is the purpose of this draft and i

853
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
think that the draft

854
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,040
also

855
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,160
it describes the scalability uh itself

856
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
so maybe you can also check the content

857
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
of the draft

858
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
hope i can i have clarified this

859
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,079
okay i will continue with this

860
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
so for the to advertise the t attributes

861
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,000
of each median alto bundle is extended a

862
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,880
bit

863
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,960
uh because outer bundle can be used

864
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,920
as a bundle of the layer 2 physical or

865
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,440
virtual membranes

866
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
and here each of the member link can be

867
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,480
associated with a separate region

868
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
and here we

869
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
define a new flag called exclusive flag

870
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,920
and to indicate whether these member

871
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,160
links can be used for sharing load

872
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,359
balancing or the age member link is used

873
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,280
exclusively for the associated media

874
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,520
and for the correlation between a flash

875
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,720
ago and the layer to member links

876
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
this is based on the extended i mean

877
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,400
group or color

878
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
basically each length member link

879
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,599
are configured with a unique color which

880
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,160
is used as an include rule in the

881
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,480
corresponding fad

882
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
and admin group of the parent list

883
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,040
reading is set to the union of all the

884
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
colors of its little two member links

885
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,520
with this mechanism we can ensure that

886
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,160
uh each flash algo is associated with

887
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,040
the parent layer link and the forwarding

888
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
plane the traffic will be forwarded

889
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
using the corresponding neutral member

890
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,880
link

891
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
and and the t attributes of the limit

892
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,280
remembering advertised based on the

893
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,480
existing rfc 8668

894
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,920
now here are the updates in the recent

895
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,440
revisions

896
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
basically we solve the comments received

897
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
both online and offline

898
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,000
we also clarify the role of the flag in

899
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
the outer bundle tlv let us clarify the

900
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,359
correlation mechanism between the flux

901
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,560
algo and the lymph membranes

902
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,520
then

903
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,599
there are some of the

904
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,839
improvement under in the descriptions

905
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,320
about the forwarding plane behaviors

906
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
based on the algorithm's specific

907
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
prefixes and adjacencies which are

908
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,400
associated with the vtn

909
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,480
and some auditory changes are most made

910
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,839
in these revisions

911
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,079
for the next steps we think the

912
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,760
mechanism and the content has been

913
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,880
stable

914
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,960
and authors would like to ask for

915
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,160
working group adoption of this document

916
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
thank you

917
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,400
comments

918
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,680
uh

919
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,079
peter you're in the cube

920
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
you're up

921
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,440
to pick up china so i found the solution

922
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
that you are proposing rather hacky

923
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
by trying to

924
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
mess up with the affinities of the l2

925
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,720
members and then being a union of the l3

926
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,640
member and all that stuff

927
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
you are doing this for a very very

928
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
specific case where you have l2 bundle

929
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,440
members this is not a generic solution i

930
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
think and i believe there are other and

931
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,119
better solutions have to solve this

932
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
yeah take that

933
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,520
could i make that comment

934
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
before i think uh

935
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,720
this is to

936
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
minimize the changes to the protocols

937
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,240
and we reuse what we already have

938
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
it's on the combination i'm not just the

939
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,119
one

940
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,040
a minor extension of the flag

941
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
if you have other proposals maybe you

942
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,920
can

943
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,839
also suggest them

944
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,920
on the list or offline

945
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,240
welcome

946
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,879
so um

947
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
i'm i'm going to take basically uh

948
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
joel's point earlier along with peter's

949
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
now

950
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,680
uh and just i'm just wondering

951
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,200
out loud

952
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,839
as a working group member

953
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,160
if you know just we don't necessarily

954
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,880
have to have multiple solutions to

955
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,480
something if we come up with a really

956
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,920
good solution that covers all the cases

957
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,599
so obviously other people are thinking

958
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,520
about this too outside the context of

959
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
this presentation and this solution

960
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,760
um

961
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
you know let's let's not create bespoke

962
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
solutions if we have a a nice good one

963
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
that covers all the cases

964
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,920
so i think going forward we need to keep

965
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,640
our eye on that

966
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
yeah i agree maybe

967
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,920
maybe one solution will be more

968
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,880
scalable but this two solution has their

969
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,040
own applicabilities

970
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
such as like uh even if we have defined

971
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
the multi topology we still have the

972
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,000
flat circle defined

973
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
to provide some similarity similar

974
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,680
functionality that is uh

975
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,720
why we

976
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,960
propose two solutions one based on mta

977
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
one based on flash up

978
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,400
because both are adopted

979
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,440
mechanisms in the working group

980
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
some people may use either one of them

981
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,839
based on their choice

982
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,480
um okay ac

983
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
yeah i got a quick one gee i think

984
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
that's a circular circular argument i

985
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
hope you know what that is i'm saying we

986
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
have to because

987
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,400
we want to have two and let people use

988
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,319
it i think i think what you're the

989
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,880
reason you you flex algorithm is because

990
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
it's less data plane resource and that

991
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,280
should say that because certainly you

992
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,359
wouldn't want this hacky solution with

993
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,960
flex algo if you could use mt i mean mt

994
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
is just so much simpler

995
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,119
so i think you need to justify why you'd

996
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,599
even consider flex cell goal

997
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,760
but after you've answered uh joel's

998
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,079
question

999
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,520
that would be the a second level

1000
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
question

1001
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,920
yeah i think there are two separate

1002
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,440
questions the journals one i have uh

1003
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,280
clarified maybe i can clarify this

1004
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,880
further in the middle east

1005
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
yeah for this one

1006
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
i just just

1007
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,920
give a answer why flash argo and both

1008
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,400
flashover and and t vista solution

1009
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,240
are proposed

1010
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,000
they have different uh slightly

1011
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,359
different

1012
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,960
categories testis

1013
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,839
right

1014
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,400
but we can't have a further discussion

1015
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,880
on the list

1016
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,160
okay thanks let's uh move to the next

1017
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,400
presentation uh tony

1018
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,599
thank you

1019
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,319
tony lee

1020
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
sorry sorry

1021
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
multiple yeah i know i don't have the

1022
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,920
agenda you can't see it

1023
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
cancel

1024
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,680
tony there we go

1025
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,880
all right tony you should see a

1026
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,920
list to select from

1027
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,160
there there we go

1028
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,359
all right

1029
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,040
good morning

1030
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,240
uh let's see this is a

1031
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
work in progress discussion

1032
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,839
um

1033
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,920
this was formerly called multi-instance

1034
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,880
tlds we've changed the name to be called

1035
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,040
multi-part tlds

1036
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,640
this has been sitting on the back burner

1037
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,440
for far too long i apologize a lot of

1038
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
that's my fault

1039
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,599
trying to get this going now

1040
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,000
if people would like to participate

1041
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,720
please do so

1042
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,920
um what problem are we trying to solve

1043
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,880
um

1044
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,119
there are many cases where we did not

1045
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,960
specify how to deal with the case where

1046
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,200
you filled up the tlv

1047
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,319
you got 255 bytes of data

1048
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,880
and subsequent work has caused some of

1049
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,520
these to fill up and overflow

1050
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,240
and some of the specs do not describe

1051
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,040
what to do when you run out of space

1052
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,880
so we tried to write some normative text

1053
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,000
the goal here is to um

1054
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,480
write something that says okay if you're

1055
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,440
going to run out of space insert

1056
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,319
multiple parts of the tlv

1057
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,520
i.e

1058
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
three thing

1059
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,880
two or more things

1060
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,079
that have the same tlv code point

1061
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,520
and you

1062
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,680
treat that as a concatenated contents

1063
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,560
um

1064
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,319
we need to have this solution for all

1065
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,319
the old tlv's that have not specified

1066
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,760
things

1067
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,079
we want to have a default in place so

1068
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,200
that

1069
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,880
if somebody forgets

1070
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,200
there is a backstop

1071
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,760
we are not trying to override solutions

1072
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,599
for tlds that already have said

1073
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,000
something explicit

1074
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,040
um

1075
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,640
pretty straightforward

1076
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,040
just use multiple parts

1077
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,440
um if you have something inside the tlv

1078
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,240
that

1079
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,880
specifies the contents and what we're

1080
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,040
calling a key

1081
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
you should replicate that key in each

1082
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,880
part

1083
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,119
okay for example type 22 tlvs

1084
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,280
you've got a

1085
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
seven octets of

1086
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,839
system id and pseudonode number

1087
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,880
and

1088
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,359
there's a metric and

1089
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,280
do you replicate that or not that's

1090
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,640
discussed to be discussed

1091
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,079
so you

1092
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,040
need to figure out what the key is and

1093
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,680
we need to agree on what that key is so

1094
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,240
all implementations concur but we are

1095
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,400
trying not to be normative about

1096
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,920
discussing the key

1097
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
um the problem with being normative

1098
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,839
about talking about that is that then we

1099
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,480
become a catalog of every tlv and we

1100
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,040
don't want to do that

1101
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,560
excuse me

1102
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,200
so um we're going to add more examples

1103
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,079
trying to make sure everybody agrees

1104
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,119
um

1105
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,119
let's see

1106
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,640
and the other thing we were discussing

1107
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,119
is adding a router capability uh to

1108
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,720
discuss to to agree to using this um not

1109
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,560
everybody's on board with this

1110
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,440
um but we are discussing it

1111
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,119
so

1112
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,760
in discussions welcome

1113
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,400
please feel free to chime in we need

1114
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,160
light not heat

1115
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,200
thank you

1116
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,520
any questions

1117
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
go ahead chris cool

1118
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,040
uh actually go ahead katan

1119
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,359
a question about the capability thing uh

1120
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,520
so is it was this and i asked this on

1121
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
the main list as well uh was this

1122
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,040
intended more as an informational or to

1123
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,920
trigger some actions on the router

1124
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,800
um so the intent here was

1125
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,720
there's a concern that

1126
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,880
doing multi-part tlvs

1127
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,559
could cause some

1128
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,000
legacy implementations indigestion

1129
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,200
what happens if you see two

1130
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,359
tlv22s and you're not quite ready for it

1131
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,520
if your code doesn't do that you could

1132
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
do lots of different things

1133
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,880
in the extreme situation you could crash

1134
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,160
you could

1135
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,880
only retain the first part you could

1136
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,440
only retain the second part

1137
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,720
the semantics are very very weird and so

1138
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,839
the proposal was have a capability so

1139
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,400
that you just don't advertise multiple

1140
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,640
parts until you see everyone advertising

1141
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
this capability

1142
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,119
so my understanding is that there are

1143
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,319
already implementations deployed which

1144
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,720
do multipart so is this something that

1145
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,319
we have seen

1146
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,599
or has been reported

1147
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,760
there are implementations that do

1148
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
multi-part there are implementations

1149
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,880
that don't do multi-part

1150
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,359
this is known this is not an at issue

1151
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,480
no i mean has have the problems been

1152
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,720
so understand for as an operator for an

1153
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,280
operator to know the capability of the

1154
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,160
routers and use that information it's

1155
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,839
useful but i think

1156
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,440
it'll be it's a may be problematic uh to

1157
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
have the router change behavior

1158
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,359
based on this

1159
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,160
i'm introducing it at this stage

1160
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,399
well this is why we were discussing this

1161
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,319
okay uh so i was sort of curious i i

1162
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,440
think you spoke to this earlier but

1163
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,839
since we we have you you said you don't

1164
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,640
want to be a catalog but we also have

1165
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,400
all the tlbs so far defined

1166
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,160
you know have we gone through and and

1167
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,480
said well this this is you know this is

1168
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,800
a tlb that's obviously a multi-part they

1169
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,559
didn't talk about it

1170
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,680
um

1171
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,760
i mean would it

1172
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,079
especially with the capability thing i

1173
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,839
kind of like it feels like if you put

1174
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,440
the capability thing and you really want

1175
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,880
to go back through all the old tlbs

1176
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,280
and say here are the keys

1177
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,520
you know or this doesn't need a key or

1178
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,880
you know or something like that

1179
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,920
well again we're trying not to be a

1180
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,480
catalog because then somebody asks why

1181
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,640
didn't you list this one

1182
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,440
and

1183
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,280
you know we'd rather have people apply

1184
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,599
intelligence

1185
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,760
the

1186
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,839
capability should not make a difference

1187
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,280
as to

1188
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,720
the behavior

1189
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,040
um

1190
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,720
it should just be a compa

1191
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,599
a trigger for being able to

1192
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,119
advertise multi-part tlvs

1193
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,960
just to ensure that everything in the

1194
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
domain is ready

1195
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,040
or in the area is ready to hear

1196
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,599
multi-part

1197
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,799
go ahead les

1198
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,559
i think to say at this point about the

1199
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,319
capability is

1200
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,800
you know there are multiple

1201
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,680
uh opinions on this even among uh the

1202
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,119
authors

1203
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,040
and the authors are going to be meeting

1204
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,000
and discussing this

1205
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,960
i think

1206
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
we should wait until

1207
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,040
the next version of the draft is out

1208
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,680
if the capability is still there

1209
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,559
uh

1210
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,359
we will also you know be addressing you

1211
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,720
know some of the

1212
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,880
uh net you know concerns about how to

1213
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,079
use this

1214
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,520
then we can have a more meaningful

1215
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,839
discussion i'd really suggest tabling

1216
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,680
this discussion uh for a bit

1217
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,599
indeed we're trying to make everybody

1218
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,240
happy all at the same time and if that's

1219
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,800
possible we will do the best we can

1220
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,160
um and if folks have preferences is that

1221
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,079
what they would like to see in the draft

1222
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,960
please let us know

1223
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,680
easy so i'll reiterate my comment and

1224
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,240
list if you in your discussions you

1225
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,400
decide that you won't advertise if not

1226
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,559
everybody advertises the

1227
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,920
capability won't advertise the

1228
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,559
multi-part you have to specify what you

1229
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,720
do with this additional information if

1230
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,400
you just don't advertise it or how you

1231
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,319
choose there has to be some statement

1232
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,400
there

1233
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,160
my thinking is you just don't advertise

1234
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,160
it

1235
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,200
done

1236
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
okay uh so just a quick follow up on

1237
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,960
that uh

1238
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,000
uh

1239
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,800
how does uh how does uh how do routers

1240
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,480
decide which information not to

1241
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,800
advertise right and what if router a in

1242
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
implementation a decides to advertise

1243
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,079
tlb

1244
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,000
let's say 10 and the other router

1245
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,040
decides to order tlu-12 right then i

1246
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,240
mean

1247
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,720
probably nothing will work a lot of

1248
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,839
stuff will get broken

1249
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,280
so even even

1250
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,599
even amongst routers which uh do

1251
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,359
multi-part right uh they would have

1252
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,640
normally got everything but yeah

1253
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,680
right well the the thing to do is to

1254
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,960
advertise the new the old

1255
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,640
legacy information

1256
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,960
because that's what's been there forever

1257
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,640
and then the new stuff that's causing

1258
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,280
you to overflow into a second part

1259
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,720
that probably should not get advertised

1260
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,280
okay so i mean a very quick follow-up so

1261
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,559
now we would then again just as the key

1262
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,000
we would get down to uh cataloging and

1263
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,319
saying which is old and what is new

1264
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,720
right uh we start going by that down

1265
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,040
that path again and i'm trying to

1266
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,880
finesse this by adding language that

1267
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,119
says that without being normative about

1268
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,839
every single tlv type

1269
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,319
okay yeah i think we can discuss further

1270
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,960
uh on the list thanks uh thanks for

1271
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,119
taking this work up thank you sure

1272
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,640
hi looks like

1273
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,640
this solution is not a backward

1274
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,359
compatible right

1275
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,520
it's backward compatible it's not

1276
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,359
forward compatible

1277
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,319
multi-part tlvs are not fully available

1278
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,720
for example if we have uh

1279
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,440
you have a prv is bigger

1280
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,160
than 255 right

1281
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,040
so you

1282
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,839
you have multiple parts but uh if we

1283
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,839
have older router and then that will not

1284
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,559
recognize that one right

1285
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,200
exactly why the capability

1286
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,839
yeah so that one that means that

1287
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,599
we have new things and then the old

1288
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,040
router cannot support it and then we

1289
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,480
have some problems

1290
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,520
so

1291
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,920
which is why we have the capability so

1292
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,599
all routers can stand up and say we're

1293
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,119
new we're ready please send us new data

1294
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,559
i think maybe

1295
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,640
it's better to have a solution and then

1296
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,640
we have new scenes

1297
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,079
multiple paths

1298
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,640
also for the older routers

1299
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,240
they don't have this capability maybe

1300
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,960
just the law and then we can

1301
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,720
have a buyer's problem

1302
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,440
all routers will not just ignore okay

1303
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,599
they will take and see

1304
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,720
multi-parts and possibly do many bad

1305
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,359
things including crashing

1306
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,760
so we kind of know

1307
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,480
because this new scene all the other way

1308
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,160
don't know these things

1309
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,480
so how how the old router process this

1310
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,760
new things

1311
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,079
right we don't want to advertise the new

1312
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,640
things until we know all the routers in

1313
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,760
the area

1314
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,480
are

1315
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,240
capable that's the point of having the

1316
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,839
capability

1317
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,520
yeah no i know that's a one solution i

1318
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,520
think maybe normally the solution is

1319
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,319
that

1320
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,400
we have new things the old router you

1321
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,000
don't know this thing and just ignore

1322
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,599
and then there's a everyone happy right

1323
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,640
um that would be nice but we can't we

1324
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,280
don't have a good mechanism for causing

1325
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,319
old routers to ignore multi parts

1326
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,920
okay yeah okay

1327
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,680
we're out of time yeah maybe i can think

1328
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,079
about that thank you

1329
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,799
is it really quick

1330
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,160
discussing things with a bunch of

1331
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,559
engineers we can't stop

1332
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,599
following

1333
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,040
the logic but

1334
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,640
this is there's a discussion that needs

1335
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,440
to be had here let's wait until

1336
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
the next version of the draft

1337
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,440
and hopefully if capability is still

1338
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,680
there we'll have more content

1339
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,880
to address

1340
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,480
all of these points

1341
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,280
yeah i mean i i hear you but

1342
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,760
that's kind of exclusionary right i mean

1343
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,280
we could also have that discussion on

1344
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,960
the mailing list with people that aren't

1345
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,319
authors

1346
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,040
so

1347
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,119
but absolutely well we're out of agenda

1348
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,599
time though so yep like i do take your

1349
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,440
point there

1350
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,680
uh okay so let's move on to the next

1351
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,399
thanks tony

1352
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,880
now it's tony p

1353
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,720
well fool me once no fool you twice

1354
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,000
stop only behind me uh oh yeah yeah good

1355
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,730
good hang on

1356
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,880
[Music]

1357
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,119
it's all right this is the distributed

1358
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,880
uh

1359
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,240
flooding

1360
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,400
yeah sure i think this works

1361
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
no it won't never mind how could that

1362
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,839
possibly work i didn't put anything in

1363
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,040
my computer

1364
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,520
nothing works yeah never mind

1365
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,400
yeah technology we know all about it hey

1366
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,000
so i'm wearing my presentation t-shirt

1367
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,880
to generate moire you know patterns

1368
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,319
uh uh

1369
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,079
talking quickly about the stuff uh that

1370
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,559
we were running for a while which is the

1371
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,440
kind of you know yet another flavor

1372
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,559
can people here in the back

1373
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,400
all right now in rockstar mode good

1374
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,000
so this has been going on for a while

1375
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
you can see there's another you know uh

1376
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,160
flavor of this flood reduction stuff it

1377
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,680
does a little bit more

1378
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,960
um the shrut on it white and me please

1379
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,040
flip on i joined because i know i work

1380
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,359
on the draft now for a little bit um

1381
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,880
influence it next one please

1382
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
okay so history and what is it the next

1383
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,200
steps next one please

1384
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,720
so the history for a few

1385
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,319
so the whole idea is basically uh based

1386
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,079
on work that's been done before and

1387
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,040
money you know like published rfcs

1388
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,440
the five series uh the variant of that

1389
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,839
is actually already as well implemented

1390
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,760
you know and we have it well debugged

1391
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,280
and

1392
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,160
running forward with it in rift uh so in

1393
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,240
a sense you know it's nothing earth

1394
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,599
shattering here we just took it forward

1395
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,640
uh

1396
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,319
so new modified algorithm basically

1397
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,880
based on the mana principle um

1398
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,640
we don't do not need any kind of

1399
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,160
signaling you know or protocol

1400
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,520
extensions really

1401
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,559
um

1402
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,240
it does not require all the nodes in the

1403
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,680
area to support it so you can just

1404
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
basically drop notes that do that

1405
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,599
and arbitrarily mix them with the old

1406
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,640
stuff

1407
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,799
um why it's important to have and you

1408
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,119
know drafting rfcs because if you drop

1409
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,440
people doing that they all have to do

1410
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,960
the same thing right it's kind of a

1411
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,280
distributed hashing table everybody has

1412
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,319
has to run the same algorithm

1413
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,680
completely distributed nothing

1414
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,119
centralized

1415
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,960
again no signaling right no indication

1416
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,680
that stuff is even running

1417
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,440
so the staff is kind of a further

1418
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,319
development of

1419
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,240
open fabric which was the stuff that

1420
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,920
came out of linkedin and has been

1421
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
actually implemented in fr but that used

1422
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,839
kind of ling local flooding it was early

1423
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:10,880
version

1424
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,480
we kind of you know tuned that stuff

1425
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,599
further and we do also something uh

1426
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,520
above which is not only flood reduction

1427
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,040
but also kind of distribution of the

1428
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,319
flood load

1429
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,839
across

1430
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,680
the topology and not only just following

1431
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,599
a single tree or two trees

1432
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,200
um

1433
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,599
so this fr has this early implementation

1434
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,599
and now there's an implementation but an

1435
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,960
unnamed obvious vendor right um

1436
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,280
and uh we tested it works well i mean

1437
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
it's not deployed yet but you know

1438
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,599
we're pretty confident we have numbers

1439
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,359
and so on next one please

1440
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,000
seven minutes okay so i'll go in one

1441
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,720
ugly picture um

1442
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,040
uh a bunch of cars i hope you can follow

1443
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,799
me so at the very bottom is the

1444
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,880
originator of the lsp right so somebody

1445
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,359
originates it and obviously the first

1446
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,880
hop you have to flood it to everyone

1447
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,720
there's nothing to be done

1448
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,240
and then

1449
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,480
in the middle uh if you read it on the

1450
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,119
left a transmitting neighbor

1451
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,960
this is the

1452
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,079
note that sends you the lsp right and

1453
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,040
the black guy the f is the receiver so

1454
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,480
i'm at f

1455
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,839
but it's very important that the

1456
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,200
transmitting neighbor is kind of

1457
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,119
important here right

1458
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,920
so

1459
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,040
the f receiving this lsps

1460
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,880
needs first

1461
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,720
shortest path tree

1462
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,640
from the originator to transmitter so

1463
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,359
those are the green links right

1464
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,440
so you have to compute that from the

1465
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,920
view of the transmitting neighbor

1466
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,119
and then you compute basically uh two

1467
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,960
things and some colors something has

1468
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,680
been cut off so you compute this yellow

1469
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,640
front

1470
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,839
which are

1471
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,400
all the intermediate immediate neighbors

1472
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,640
of the transmitting neighbor

1473
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,200
right so that kind of gives you like the

1474
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,880
one hope thing

1475
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,799
and from there on

1476
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,799
right and you uh there is a lot of

1477
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,400
optimization i'm a meeting you know like

1478
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,160
you can kick out all these guys that are

1479
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,440
on the shortest path through the

1480
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,119
originator because you know that that's

1481
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,040
all the propagation front

1482
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,799
and then you compute

1483
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,960
the

1484
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,160
two hop neighbors the thl so from this

1485
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,440
point of view of this first hop

1486
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,400
neighbors you take the next after those

1487
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,640
right so this is impressive basically

1488
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,559
his view of the propagation front and

1489
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,880
you're just somewhere in it right he

1490
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,319
propagates through its intermediate

1491
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,839
neighbors into two hop neighbors and you

1492
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,839
somewhere in here

1493
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,240
and you have to know whether you are one

1494
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,040
of these guys that is responsible to

1495
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,920
cover the two hop neighbors

1496
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,559
right so so the logic is

1497
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,400
until you make this mental step that

1498
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,160
you're really computing on behalf the

1499
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
guy transmitting towards you

1500
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,440
you'll not understand the moment you

1501
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,119
make this mental leap it becomes easy

1502
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,720
right you're one of the guys in the

1503
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,200
middle one hop away from him and you

1504
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,720
have to make decision whether you cover

1505
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,839
the two hop for him or you don't

1506
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,280
right and basically the algorithm

1507
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,280
reduces bunch of people out in a

1508
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,200
distributed fashion if you're one of

1509
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,720
those you have to retransmit then if

1510
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,319
you're not you just shut up because you

1511
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,079
know that other people already covered

1512
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,039
the two hop neighbors all right

1513
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,480
and the rest is just mechanics and

1514
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,920
there's a lot of optimization like if

1515
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,440
you know that the two hope neighbor is

1516
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,280
actually only one hop away from the

1517
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,200
originator can cut it out and so on and

1518
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,839
so on but that is pretty much the whole

1519
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,079
thing so for people who are less visual

1520
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,319
oriented you know and can follow my you

1521
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,039
know

1522
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,880
da vinci quality picture you know early

1523
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,160
da vinci

1524
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,839
next one

1525
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,480
i give you uh the stuff you know for the

1526
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,559
algorithmic thing so

1527
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,880
you co you assume all metrics run on the

1528
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,760
graph

1529
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,280
overload is of course ignored because

1530
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,799
your flat on overload

1531
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,119
then you build the shortest path tree

1532
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,280
from the origin or to the transmitting

1533
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,640
node right

1534
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,720
and then you build

1535
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,400
the

1536
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,839
rnl d agents this one hop into hop from

1537
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,440
the view of transmitting the airports

1538
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,359
towards you okay

1539
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,520
then you take

1540
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,799
this one hop away

1541
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,039
from the transmitting neighbor list on

1542
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,720
which you are

1543
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,359
and you order it based on system id

1544
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,000
everybody does that and here comes the

1545
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,480
delicate trick that you didn't see

1546
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,160
in the picture

1547
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,880
to load balance

1548
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,960
who

1549
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,359
propagates you also use the lsp id

1550
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,480
so now depending on the lsp id that is

1551
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,000
being flooded

1552
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,920
different people are picked

1553
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,240
from the first hop to propagate to the

1554
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,760
second hop

1555
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,359
all right that is subtle this year i

1556
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,280
completely admit but

1557
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,039
that basically gives you

1558
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,720
a flat

1559
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,880
balancing across the graph so it's not

1560
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,039
like a single tree where everything goes

1561
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,559
you know through

1562
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,480
it is depending on which lsps are

1563
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,160
flooded they will pick up kind of

1564
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,920
different trees you can imagine it's a

1565
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,520
simplified picture but it but it's

1566
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,799
sufficient

1567
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,200
so you reduce the volume by what we find

1568
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
is about 70 percent

1569
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,000
but

1570
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,480
not by choking on you know a bunch of

1571
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,720
links the whole flooding but basically

1572
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,440
balancing us across the whole graph

1573
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,960
um and

1574
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,559
for people who say well this is like way

1575
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,559
too much computation under stable

1576
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,760
topology

1577
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,160
uh you know you compute only on demand

1578
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,520
right these things

1579
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,200
depending from whom you see the lsps

1580
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,440
which lsps you see and you can cache all

1581
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,200
these results stable

1582
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,359
because they only depend on the topology

1583
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,240
and on the originator on the lsp id

1584
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,640
right no sequence number nothing so once

1585
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,720
you kind of cache these things out

1586
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
stuff doesn't need any computation

1587
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,640
and um the experience from the

1588
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,319
implementation is actually the load to

1589
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,079
compute those things directly relative

1590
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,119
in your school

1591
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,000
okay well yeah i mean i had my concern

1592
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,599
so read the draft there's a lot of

1593
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,680
consideration there you know the lsp id

1594
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,440
and so on and so on right

1595
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,760
so you don't do it per lsp id you do it

1596
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,280
on some hashing functions the very you

1597
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,039
know you you been bucket those guys and

1598
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,799
so on but that's you know

1599
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,119
rita draft contribute have an opinion i

1600
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,720
mean i don't want to swap you you know

1601
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,480
swamp you with this stuff next one

1602
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,160
so what happens if the whole thing

1603
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,760
partitions right like things are great

1604
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,039
when things are great when something

1605
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,640
breaks and somebody forgets to send

1606
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,680
something

1607
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,960
so the way we fix it is that

1608
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,280
we keep the list of whom did we omit

1609
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,680
doing all these optimizations right and

1610
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,280
we run some small timers and don't

1611
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,920
forget psnp so you know it's very dense

1612
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,440
package you can describe a couple of

1613
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,079
these lsps just by their signature and

1614
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,319
basically periodically so if these guys

1615
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,240
go to stuff they will all deter some

1616
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,079
other way they may possibly tell you oh

1617
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,039
you know

1618
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,640
uh do you have this thing and you

1619
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,319
already have it right so you add kids a

1620
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,400
lot of this stuff cancels out already

1621
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,240
but if these guys didn't update you yet

1622
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,920
that they have it you basically bucket

1623
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,520
those things and you throw it at them

1624
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,880
and go like here's the version if they

1625
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
have it nothing happens you get ack

1626
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,599
minimal or otherwise they will request

1627
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,440
it and repair the graph

1628
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,200
right so

1629
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,079
things go pear shaped apple apple-shaped

1630
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,039
whatever uh you will have some small

1631
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,119
hiccup right until the timer catches up

1632
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,880
and kind of uh

1633
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,400
you know

1634
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,240
puts the stuff through what is not

1635
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,640
really the the mean the minimal graft

1636
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,480
that you computed and then hopefully you

1637
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,160
know the whole thing settles again and

1638
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,000
and and chucks happily

1639
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,960
um

1640
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,280
and this does not change any of this

1641
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,960
psnp you know sent or um

1642
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,200
received procedures right you don't need

1643
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,000
to we operate just on the standard psnp

1644
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,440
stuff we just play this little trick

1645
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,720
that we only send them or you know where

1646
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,400
we know we didn't send stuff to make

1647
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,240
sure that the guy has it in case he

1648
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,280
didn't set us yet the psnp or csnps or

1649
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,599
whatever next one

1650
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,480
ah oh yeah i'm also this is the last one

1651
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,720
next one i'm still five minutes man what

1652
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,400
will i do sing a song i don't know yeah

1653
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,200
you don't want those just oh

1654
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,400
thanks yeah so i won't sing the song um

1655
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,079
nobody got properly scared when i said

1656
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,960
that but it's okay so uh right please

1657
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,039
look at the stuff um embarrassingly

1658
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,200
simple um

1659
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,079
osp

1660
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,319
version would be valuable you know

1661
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,000
fairly obvious i mean all the same

1662
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,720
mechanism and schwarz jumped to shark a

1663
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,319
little bit here put the work group

1664
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,880
adoption on it but um

1665
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,319
yeah you know

1666
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,359
stuff's

1667
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,240
straightforward if you think through it

1668
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,760
uh took us after a couple of round

1669
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,599
optimization i influenced the draft not

1670
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,520
another another but the stuff is largely

1671
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,280
in place it's implemented it kind of

1672
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,559
works and

1673
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,000
important to say this works for

1674
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,839
arbitrary topologies obviously this is

1675
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,680
not any you know club optimization or

1676
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,440
anything like that

1677
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,039
yeah i mean open for comments i'm kind

1678
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,440
of done

1679
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,240
this i like this version

1680
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,280
uh

1681
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,760
in order to order a magnitude

1682
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,920
better than the original version i like

1683
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,400
this version that it does and and it is

1684
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,960
close to the you know i mean it's it's

1685
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,839
different but it has a lot of the uh

1686
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,839
same using the two hop neighbors and

1687
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,200
covering all the two hop neighbors and

1688
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,920
doing that dynamically is a lot like

1689
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,280
the draft you mentioned the cds that

1690
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,359
richard algiere did for monet it's

1691
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,119
really it's really good the one question

1692
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,198
i had is you know all those other ones

1693
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,359
they tried to get two copies of it where

1694
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,520
this tries to get one

1695
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,839
oh yeah yeah

1696
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,600
brilliant yeah yes

1697
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,640
okay so observe that

1698
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,560
so i omitted this this step right when

1699
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,198
you sort these neighbors and then you

1700
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,120
take the hash of the lsp to know where

1701
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,319
you start and that will give you

1702
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,600
balancing so you don't start with the

1703
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,080
smallest system id depending on the lsp

1704
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,120
id

1705
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,198
well not really like a hash of it so you

1706
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,719
don't have too many buckets you start

1707
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,080
somewhere in the middle or you know

1708
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,399
whatever for every lsp so you use

1709
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,560
different guys and while you're taking

1710
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,120
these guys off the list in a sense you

1711
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,679
are looking which of the two hope

1712
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,439
neighbors does this guy cover and the

1713
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,120
moment you have full coverage of the two

1714
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,279
hope neighbors you go like okay i'm done

1715
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,799
right those are all the guys that are

1716
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,679
really re-flooding now right nothing

1717
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,679
prevents you and every node can do it

1718
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,198
differently to

1719
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,439
from generating a double coverage you go

1720
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,279
like i'm taking these neighbors off the

1721
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,600
list and i'm counting the two hope

1722
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,198
neighbors whether they have been covered

1723
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,479
twice that's what rift does and all

1724
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,000
three times so whatever it can be a

1725
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,759
local configuration

1726
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,600
right and each guy can actually do it

1727
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
independently some guys can cover once

1728
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,960
some guys can cover

1729
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,880
twice it does not really matter it will

1730
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,198
just generate additional copies

1731
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,920
but yes i think this is in the draft

1732
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,799
maybe not well explained yet

1733
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,198
but that's how double triple coverage

1734
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,560
would work

1735
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,439
okay

1736
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,960
and the other comment i had this is a

1737
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,319
quick one is

1738
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,960
you're basically doing a

1739
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,679
psnp of

1740
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,799
all the

1741
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,199
lsps that didn't get flooded so that's

1742
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,080
essentially almost to the neighbors you

1743
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,159
didn't flood yes

1744
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,440
uh that that's almost a csnp that you're

1745
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,440
doing every second that seems like a lot

1746
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,970
uh

1747
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,440
[Music]

1748
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,080
i didn't think through that well don't

1749
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,120
forget that you load balance right so

1750
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,840
an lsp will go to a

1751
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,840
if you did not

1752
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,080
reflot this specific

1753
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,320
lsp then you say like okay all the two

1754
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,640
hope neighbors i didn't reflect this lsp

1755
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,040
i have to psnp them but don't forget it

1756
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,679
balancing always on lsps so you will

1757
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,120
omit some fraction of the flooding and

1758
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,239
that will

1759
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,640
be used to generate this psnp saying you

1760
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,760
know i omitted this lsp to you guys

1761
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,719
so

1762
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,640
it is a fraction you know how much of a

1763
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,000
fraction will depend on the hashing

1764
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,679
function if it's evenly distributed it

1765
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,000
should be an even fraction

1766
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,400
so it's not really a csnp of the whole

1767
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,040
database it's just the fraction that you

1768
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,280
didn't reflock based on the hashing

1769
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,239
algorithm for these lsp

1770
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,560
it's the ones that changed

1771
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,320
it's the ones that did change but you

1772
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,000
did not re-flood to that neighbor okay

1773
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,080
that makes it a lot correct right yes

1774
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,840
exactly i thought it would i thought it

1775
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,000
was i thought it was all when i read it

1776
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
i just took that i said why are you

1777
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,159
doing all the ones that didn't change

1778
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,640
and i well you see how my name ended up

1779
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,719
on the author's list right so i had to

1780
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,120
give it a couple of helpful twists yes

1781
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,080
but let's uh okay yeah you can fix that

1782
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,760
thanks

1783
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,400
okay ben

1784
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,600
hi ben madison work online um a couple

1785
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,360
of questions and my apologies if these

1786
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,000
are in the draft i haven't read it um

1787
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,560
the first is it seems like there are

1788
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,600
topologies where running this algorithm

1789
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,280
would save you more

1790
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,880
work than others

1791
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,120
and there are probably you know probably

1792
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,640
the more regular the topology the more

1793
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,080
work you save

1794
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,400
and in a lot of service providers the

1795
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,840
network i run

1796
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,480
i i'd imagine you probably don't save a

1797
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,560
lot of work by doing all of the extra

1798
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,640
computational work

1799
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,800
have you looked at where that balance is

1800
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,400
so that you can make recommendations to

1801
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,520
operators about where they're still

1802
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,120
appropriate uh

1803
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,159
look at the average uh fan out on your

1804
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,679
network the higher the fanout the more

1805
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,520
you save that's pretty much the output

1806
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,520
you know so the claw of course will save

1807
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,080
a lot if you have a very sparse network

1808
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,600
there are very few flooding paths and

1809
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,800
like what the hell do you want to cut

1810
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,000
out right

1811
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,560
most most the generate case is something

1812
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,560
which is you know hamiltonian path or

1813
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,560
you know minimal cut you know i was like

1814
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,239
yeah there's one way to flood it so what

1815
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,080
do we optimize

1816
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,679
i think you overestimate the growth

1817
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,760
theory capabilities of most network

1818
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,199
operations i think all right but

1819
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,360
basically pros about that

1820
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,679
the smaller your your average fennel

1821
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:44,560
degree

1822
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,320
the less this thing will be useful to

1823
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,640
you right and the

1824
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,159
the bigger the diameter of the network

1825
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,320
the sparse rate is the less useful this

1826
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,960
thing will be right yeah okay that's

1827
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,719
that mean that's yeah and as to the

1828
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,400
computation we were concerned but don't

1829
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,640
forget you only compute when the stuff

1830
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,480
hits you the first time on demand so you

1831
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,159
of course you have the spanning tree of

1832
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,000
the originator right

1833
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and then when it hits you with lspid

1834
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,080
with fits in a bucket new bucket then

1835
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,520
yeah you have to recompute those lists

1836
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,120
but that's why i put it in the draft and

1837
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,800
you take the lspid and you run a very

1838
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,560
strong hash so from the same originator

1839
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,800
you will only build maybe two buckets

1840
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,480
right so the same originator will kind

1841
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,440
of use

1842
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,840
two trees maybe double coverage yeah

1843
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,679
right and if you have a million origin

1844
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,760
in the network yeah i wish isis right i

1845
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,440
mean you were bound by relatively few

1846
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,719
nodes so

1847
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,520
you know worst case like go wild and say

1848
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,960
okay i have

1849
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,920
whatever 5k notes and times 2 for the

1850
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,000
lspid buckets you have 10k of those

1851
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,280
things to pre-compute and they're

1852
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,040
relatively small they're like minimalist

1853
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,320
right and once they're in place they're

1854
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,800
in place if you start to flap links well

1855
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,719
things get interesting yeah i i operate

1856
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,159
a network in a part of the world where

1857
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,640
the sparsest parts of the network tend

1858
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,400
to be the most unstable

1859
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,400
so i i'm

1860
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,400
i would be hesitant to without quite a

1861
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,199
good reason introducing more computation

1862
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,360
work to places in the network that

1863
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,560
already have

1864
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,199
transient like moments of hell of a lot

1865
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,520
of work to do um but i i think you've

1866
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,280
answered my question right i mean you

1867
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,760
you limited if you have a few paths and

1868
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,600
a lot of flooding you're limited anyway

1869
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,280
you're pretty much that like you know

1870
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,120
there's no magic i mean quantum

1871
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,640
computing would help you wait a couple

1872
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,320
of years

1873
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,040
okay so my other question was

1874
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,360
in the case where you are kind of your

1875
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,880
weight where you're where you're

1876
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,679
computing this this load balancing of

1877
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,840
responsibility for the re-flooding yeah

1878
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,000
have you considered scenario where the

1879
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,320
node that's responsible for re-flooding

1880
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,719
for one of these buckets because of some

1881
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,280
sort of a bug or a miscomputation fails

1882
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,840
to do so psnp does that that was my

1883
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,360
question

1884
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,960
that partition recovers from that

1885
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,320
scenario

1886
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,640
even if the so even if the re-flooding

1887
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,600
node didn't know that it's broken yes

1888
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
even if it's the compute

1889
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,679
if if the

1890
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,360
if you introduce a note that is utterly

1891
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,199
broken right and doesn't refloc properly

1892
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,040
with the other guys the ps and ps will

1893
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,560
fix it and we have something in draft

1894
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,960
saying like if you see this happening

1895
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,840
excessively uh well you better call ben

1896
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,080
and say like 4am here's a problem for

1897
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,960
you like that's that's procedure

1898
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,560
yeah

1899
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,920
well you should go with reputable

1900
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,760
vendors which i always say you know i

1901
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,360
don't want the main

1902
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,679
introduce me to any um i'd be very happy

1903
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,320
to talk to them

1904
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,280
what the less these reputable vendors

1905
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,280
does that cover it okay

1906
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,840
okay less

1907
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,960
quick uh

1908
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,360
points uh maybe we should you know

1909
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,920
take it to the list but i'm not totally

1910
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,280
convinced

1911
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,560
that you don't need to advertise whether

1912
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,719
on a per node basis whether you support

1913
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,640
it or not

1914
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
and you know maybe i'm wrong but if i'm

1915
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,719
not and i don't understand why you

1916
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,719
wouldn't define this as an algorithm

1917
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,440
that would utilize the dynamic flooding

1918
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,760
uh draft infrastructure

1919
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,480
okay yeah i could answer that yeah

1920
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,120
okay so first bring bring me a case why

1921
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,760
we need to actually signal anything on

1922
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,400
technical basis if you find a case

1923
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,400
why this is required it's an interesting

1924
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,400
discussion the second question

1925
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,560
sorry if i'm not going to flood because

1926
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,880
i expect somebody else to flood and i

1927
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,719
don't know whether you know we're in

1928
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,000
sync

1929
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,320
no think that through that mixes with

1930
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,560
old nodes just fine

1931
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,719
if if you introduce new nodes they start

1932
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,800
to reduce everybody computing the same

1933
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,719
independently the old guys will still

1934
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,199
flood the full graph and that's fine

1935
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,560
and you don't have to know who is doing

1936
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,400
that who is doing that not

1937
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,600
i i know it's on you yeah i'll take a

1938
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,520
closer look the second quick comment is

1939
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,280
you use the term

1940
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,480
up-to-date psnps

1941
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,440
as as your remediation mechanism i have

1942
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,520
no idea how you would how you would

1943
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,800
determine

1944
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,000
that a psnp is quote unquote up to date

1945
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,719
because unlike a csnp a psmp doesn't

1946
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,600
have a range in it so you can't tell

1947
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
that oh yeah this covers everything

1948
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,640
between

1949
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,880
you know system id x although you have

1950
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,480
you have to list all of those things

1951
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,480
psnps don't

1952
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,400
don't give you that information

1953
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,880
are you mean the one that you are

1954
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,159
completely missed well no so think right

1955
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,679
you got these thing so you know the

1956
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,719
stuff exists and you push this psnp on

1957
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,120
the guy saying i have this psnp and if

1958
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,440
he doesn't have it he will request it

1959
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,600
right if he has an older version he will

1960
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,440
request it if he has the same version he

1961
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,280
will act and you're done

1962
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,560
yeah that's you that's not my point

1963
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,840
let's

1964
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,480
okay so i lost you yeah yeah i thought

1965
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,000
about that

1966
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,360
yeah you can't

1967
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,199
you can't know what you don't know but

1968
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,440
we don't have this problem you know i i

1969
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,719
was thinking about uh what you call it

1970
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,199
whatever you know the distributed system

1971
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,520
stuff right uh no i thought through this

1972
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,960
stuff we don't have this problem unless

1973
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,560
you convince me we do then it will

1974
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,920
become interesting yeah okay okay thanks

1975
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,280
thanks les

1976
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,560
i have a quick

1977
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,800
ospf version is fairly obvious feels

1978
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,719
like a comment from you

1979
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,199
no it's actually uh

1980
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,320
it's

1981
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,880
i i may be half culpable okay

1982
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,440
this so we can take it to the list but

1983
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,320
we we were talking psnp and csmp uh to

1984
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,480
me ospf you have a you know database

1985
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,159
exchange that's

1986
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,360
you know what i'm saying yeah you don't

1987
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,600
have this sort of live i can't just set

1988
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,679
a timer and throw some packets out and

1989
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,760
get caught up and you were absolutely

1990
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,679
correct and yes i didn't think through

1991
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,120
this stuff i was just pestered by a

1992
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,960
couple of sp saying like oh the other

1993
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,440
was pf and you know

1994
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,560
absolutely

1995
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,239
let me break in we do have an

1996
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,239
experimental draft for this i think

1997
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,480
alvaro is an offer on it

1998
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,000
uh okay

1999
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,800
yeah i mean we could we could take that

2000
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,640
i'm sure this will be experimental so we

2001
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,880
could it could reference this that the

2002
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,440
experimental draft do uh incremental

2003
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,719
databases

2004
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,679
or so replace them with relatively run

2005
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,120
with it

2006
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,000
okay

2007
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
all right thanks good thank you very

2008
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,520
much thanks

2009
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:23,400
all right next up uh i think is peter

2010
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,199
with upa

2011
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,400
yes

2012
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,760
so hello it's peter here i'm going to

2013
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,440
talk about the

2014
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,840
unreachability prefix announcement on

2015
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,199
behalf of all the cultures

2016
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,159
so the problem statement

2017
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,560
the summarization is a reality people do

2018
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,360
summarize unlike with mpls networks

2019
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,280
where it was hard to do

2020
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,040
due to the requirements of the n2 and

2021
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,080
lsp

2022
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,840
with other technologies these days

2023
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,400
summarization is possible networks are

2024
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,199
growing the number of routers is growing

2025
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:16,880
significantly

2026
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,600
and summarization helps i think that's

2027
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,600
the fact arguing about it doesn't make

2028
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
much sense in my opinion

2029
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,639
obviously summarization is not only good

2030
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:27,440
it

2031
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,679
create problems and one of the problems

2032
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,520
is that it hides information it hides

2033
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,400
the

2034
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,719
reachability of the individual routers

2035
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,120
or prefixes

2036
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,760
so the problem that we are trying to

2037
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,360
solve here is

2038
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,280
to be able to summarize and still be

2039
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,360
able to signal that something has been

2040
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,679
lost and that can be used

2041
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,000
by various applications here we are

2042
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,320
mainly talking bgp peak but it can be

2043
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,320
used by any other you know applications

2044
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,960
what this draft talks about is it gives

2045
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,679
a backward compatibility solution

2046
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,840
without any need to extend the protocols

2047
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,719
so

2048
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,800
it only only defines

2049
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,440
why we are doing it basically

2050
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,480
next slide please

2051
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,400
so if you look at the

2052
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,719
rfc

2053
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:21,840
5305 and 5308 it basically gives you a

2054
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,560
way to advertise a prefix as an

2055
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,480
unreachable prefix there is a range of

2056
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,800
metrics that if you advertise the

2057
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
tlb with that metric it basically the

2058
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,639
rfc says

2059
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,480
this prefix is unreachable from the

2060
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,440
traditional computation you can use this

2061
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,920
for other purposes that's the language

2062
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,480
that the rfc is using and all we do we

2063
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,719
are defining a new purpose here

2064
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,600
next slide please

2065
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,719
so

2066
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,040
what will and how will this work

2067
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,880
the existing nodes which will receive

2068
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,000
this

2069
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,120
will just

2070
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,120
you know flood this propagate but don't

2071
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,880
use it that's

2072
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,080
the

2073
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,760
behavior that the current specs are

2074
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,760
mandating

2075
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,320
the recognition of this advertisement

2076
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,159
and the usage is only needed on the

2077
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,400
nodes that want to use this information

2078
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,960
so typically this would be the pes

2079
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,400
if they are interested they can be

2080
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,840
configured

2081
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,840
to use this information and pass it to

2082
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
whatever applications may be interested

2083
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,080
in it

2084
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,560
the l1 l2 routers

2085
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,679
they

2086
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,760
would not propagate this today so that's

2087
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,120
the change

2088
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,880
in the behavior of the protocol that

2089
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,560
probably is the good reason why this

2090
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,320
trap exists in the first place is

2091
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,600
because

2092
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,840
we need to propagate this information

2093
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,480
between the area so if an l1l2 router

2094
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,199
attached to area x advertises this up

2095
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,080
advertisement it goes across the l2 and

2096
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,400
another l1 l2 router which attaches to

2097
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,120
area y may need to leak this information

2098
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,679
down so that's something that we are

2099
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:54,960
specifying

2100
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,480
that's something new

2101
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,760
but again this is not defining a new

2102
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,679
plb or anything we are just defining

2103
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,199
that you should propagate the

2104
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,759
unreachable prefixes

2105
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,239
and we can even bound the upa to a very

2106
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,080
specific metric if that is what the

2107
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,880
implementation wants to do

2108
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,360
next slide

2109
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,239
please so very similarly i i don't go

2110
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:24,239
into the details because it's basically

2111
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,320
the same thing but if you look at the

2112
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,760
ospf v2 and ospv3 spec it defines

2113
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,080
an ls infinity metric which basically

2114
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,800
works for external and summary lsas

2115
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
and the spec says that this is one way

2116
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,719
of flashing the information or making it

2117
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,440
unreachable so you can either flash the

2118
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,120
lsa or you can advertise it with this

2119
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,880
metric it has the same meaning basically

2120
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,639
it's unreachable

2121
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,520
next slide please

2122
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,920
and then again similarly to what has

2123
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,639
been said for isis

2124
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,199
the nodes will propagate this data it

2125
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,800
will not use

2126
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,679
or install these prefixes because it

2127
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,440
they are unreachable if they follow the

2128
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,120
spec

2129
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,120
we need to recognize these on the

2130
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,040
routers where we want to use this

2131
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,199
information which is again configurable

2132
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:12,639
and would be probably done on the edge

2133
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:13,679
nodes

2134
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,120
and again abrs would need to be

2135
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,600
smart enough to recognize this and

2136
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,239
re-advertise between the areas

2137
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,718
next slide

2138
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,639
so couple of

2139
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,600
implementation or recommendations that

2140
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,000
are worth mentioning is

2141
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,440
obviously

2142
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,480
we don't want to advertise tons of these

2143
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,800
if there is a catastrophic failure an

2144
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,440
abr or an n1 l2 router loses

2145
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,120
connectivity to everything doesn't make

2146
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,600
sense to advertise all the specific

2147
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,480
prefixes as a as an unreachable

2148
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
so there should be a bound

2149
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,520
the

2150
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,840
the use case for this is when a pe fails

2151
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,000
when not when the area partitions or

2152
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,120
some catastrophic failure happens

2153
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,360
and

2154
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,360
we don't need to keep this advertisement

2155
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,800
for a long time we need this

2156
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,960
advertisement basically for time needed

2157
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,639
to propagate them

2158
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,360
and plus some buffer obviously

2159
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,000
and then we can basically we throw them

2160
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,239
at the source

2161
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,959
yeah next slide

2162
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,560
and

2163
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,400
yeah let's start the show

2164
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,199
johnny

2165
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,520
uh tony p juniper it's kind of the side

2166
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,199
conversation we had in the hallway and

2167
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,880
ac will tell me that i'm an old man and

2168
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,360
they didn't do protocols in 25 years

2169
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,440
same thing as with the you know reverse

2170
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,400
metric stuff the infinity things can

2171
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,960
trigger a really interesting box right

2172
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,800
in lots of implementations

2173
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,400
um

2174
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,080
it's a courtesy draft i mean it's

2175
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,239
completely valid standard protocol

2176
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,159
behavior you know that you kind of use

2177
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,840
for other purposes

2178
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,760
i'm not overly concerned because if you

2179
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,000
pull up all the abrs even if the router

2180
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,440
is in the middle the crazy stuff and

2181
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,960
forward i mean you will kill the stuff

2182
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,560
on the abr right because the style you

2183
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,199
know that stuff is unreachable so

2184
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,480
yeah if we want to do it this way

2185
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,639
you know it's a list of all possible

2186
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,719
evils to abuse the protocol do this to

2187
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,400
do this kind of stuff

2188
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,480
thanks so just to let you know that

2189
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,040
there is a an implementation from an

2190
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,280
unnamed vendor

2191
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,520
and we have proved this that a reputable

2192
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,280
vendor oh yeah well i'll leave that up

2193
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,599
to you

2194
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,400
like unnamed sources

2195
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,719
of salt right

2196
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,480
okay yeah

2197
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,920
um so

2198
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,800
your your your comment is basically

2199
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,280
if we have to do unreachable you like

2200
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,840
this one it seems reasonable yeah by a

2201
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,920
far stretch by a far stretch i think

2202
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,520
it's mildly dangerous it's abusing the

2203
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,440
protocol

2204
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,360
and it should not be done this way if we

2205
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,520
really are concerned about the service

2206
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,679
going down rather than actually

2207
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,080
losing the router completely because we

2208
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,040
obviously

2209
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,080
this is not for service this is this is

2210
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,560
subtle right well i mean you kill the

2211
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,080
reachability of the router right so if

2212
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,360
there's a five different things and

2213
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,719
you're basically concerned about

2214
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,719
advertising my bgp thing went down but

2215
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,400
there's other stuff

2216
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,840
you you kill it wholesale but it doesn't

2217
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,520
like well this is what happens anyway

2218
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,199
today if you don't summarize right you

2219
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,120
lose the reachability of a box and then

2220
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,600
whatever else follows

2221
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,000
there's no difference yeah i mean

2222
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,920
you know now we start a little bit split

2223
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,320
herring which may matter in deployments

2224
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,679
but you know if

2225
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,159
practically speaking this this is easily

2226
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,920
done and it will be done anyway because

2227
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,600
certain reputable vendors you know they

2228
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,760
don't listen to reason always

2229
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,600
yes yeah okay i didn't

2230
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,440
go ahead with you come in

2231
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,639
so

2232
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,679
uh i i think uh as you mentioned the in

2233
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,440
the rfc

2234
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,560
you know ls infinity just

2235
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,840
indicated that the related lsa should be

2236
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,199
ignored during the spf or calculation

2237
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,440
and

2238
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,800
so

2239
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,920
there is no rvc to indicate that such a

2240
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,639
and that is infinity indicated the

2241
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,080
prefix is unreachable so i will think

2242
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,520
uh and also a point point out in the

2243
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,600
middle east several other person also

2244
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,840
point out that

2245
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,000
we need one

2246
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,840
explicit uh indication for the prolific

2247
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,320
unreachable so this is my

2248
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,480
this is my command okay

2249
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,520
okay i believe we can safely use ls

2250
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,760
infinity to indicate this if you read

2251
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,320
the specification

2252
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,920
very very

2253
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,000
uh you know thoroughly you will realize

2254
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,280
we can do that

2255
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,719
uh in terms of adding a very specific or

2256
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,320
you know explicit signaling for

2257
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,480
unreachability on top of this

2258
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,199
i still haven't heard any technical

2259
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,440
argument that would convince me beneath

2260
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,360
i know couple of poor few people have

2261
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,719
suggested that

2262
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,400
if they come up with the feasible

2263
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,159
technical argument i'm all for it i

2264
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,759
haven't heard any so far

2265
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,800
there there may be

2266
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,239
other situations that use less infinity

2267
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,960
to indicate other things so i think we

2268
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,719
should mix up

2269
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,560
this field to the other perform okay

2270
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,719
okay you can you can put that on a list

2271
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,719
and we can we can discuss the one

2272
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,040
example that you use that is for the ip

2273
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,000
flex logo on osp v3 i don't see a

2274
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,840
problem there but let's move that to the

2275
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,400
list because this can get lengthy

2276
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,239
okay

2277
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,718
all right g

2278
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,639
hello yeah

2279
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,360
actually i send the mail to the list uh

2280
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,600
i also read the similar comments as

2281
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,360
itunes because

2282
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,360
reading the rfcs it shows that this

2283
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,679
rs infinity metric is just to

2284
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,320
ask the receiver now to install this

2285
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,360
prefix

2286
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,440
on you not to consider this prefix in

2287
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,880
the computation and now to

2288
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,000
remove it from another prefix which may

2289
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,679
cover this uh prefix right this is uh so

2290
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,080
this is a new behavior comparing to the

2291
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,960
previous statement in rc

2292
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,159
maybe and uh rc also mentioned that this

2293
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,280
uh

2294
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,320
rs infinity can be used for multiple use

2295
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,840
cases so in order to accurately indicate

2296
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,239
the which uh use cases you are

2297
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:04,239
using nate for and what is the expected

2298
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,639
behavior of the receiver uh maybe a more

2299
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,159
accurate

2300
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:11,920
indicator will be needed in the packet

2301
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,320
so i guess i already commenting on both

2302
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,920
of your comments so i'm not going to

2303
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,480
repeat that

2304
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,840
okay zebo

2305
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,960
hello okay

2306
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,960
one question

2307
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,760
that's the s infinity magicka of ip

2308
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,440
flash ego

2309
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:40,080
also need to be processed as upa

2310
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,159
and

2311
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,800
for ipflex algo what we defined if i

2312
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,239
recall correctly is that we advertise

2313
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,280
the

2314
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,159
the base tlv within infinity metric and

2315
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:53,440
include the

2316
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,239
metric of the flex algo inside

2317
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:57,679
so obviously

2318
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,000
the metric for the base algo

2319
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,239
or algozio in this advertisement is

2320
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,400
never used so it cannot be interpreted

2321
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,880
as unreachable it's just the field that

2322
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,719
we put there because we are not

2323
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,199
advertising algo0

2324
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,760
in that base tlv

2325
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,480
so that metric is always ignored

2326
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,480
and it obviously has no relation to

2327
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,280
algo0 you would have to go inside and

2328
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,120
look at the metric for the individual

2329
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,159
ipl goes and where the ls infinity can

2330
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,280
be used as a upa

2331
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,360
okay

2332
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,520
ac

2333
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,600
your mic is not on yet ac

2334
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,800
completely with peter uh this and the

2335
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,320
beauty of this is we use the same

2336
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,840
mechanism used for backward

2337
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,480
compatibility for the signaling now

2338
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,719
obviously only the routers that support

2339
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,679
the specification will act on the event

2340
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,960
notification but i mean that would be it

2341
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,880
no matter how you solve this problem

2342
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,400
that would be the case

2343
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,600
so it's um the two the two usages don't

2344
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,239
are are complementary they don't uh

2345
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,800
contradict one another they're both uh a

2346
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,400
signaling of of of unreachability

2347
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,718
right

2348
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,320
uh i guess

2349
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,560
as a working group member i don't like

2350
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,760
any of these i know and and

2351
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,159
you you you addressed my comment at the

2352
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:41,520
very beginning by saying you don't want

2353
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,600
to argue about the scaling requirement

2354
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,000
but i i just i don't know

2355
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,560
i'm still not sure like tony lee's idea

2356
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,480
of like let's just do a reachability

2357
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,840
protocol or the bfd ideas i i just there

2358
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
are multiple ways of doing this

2359
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,199
we've been asked

2360
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,639
by the providers to solve this in igp

2361
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:01,840
because they don't want to run any of

2362
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:07,360
the other things even bfd even bfd

2363
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,760
it's not that we are doing this because

2364
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,360
we like this we're doing this because

2365
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,880
we've been asked to address this this

2366
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,360
way it would be great if those operators

2367
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,520
would be showing up here and going you

2368
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,960
know what i'm saying like i know

2369
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,840
it used to happen

2370
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,040
okay

2371
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,199
all right well let's move on to the uh

2372
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:28,320
okay

2373
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:32,440
relevant yes thanks

2374
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,510
so um

2375
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:38,669
[Music]

2376
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,199
you will be up next

2377
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,520
let me give you the

2378
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,080
control here

2379
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,760
all right go ahead and pick your deck

2380
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,840
okay

2381
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:03,600
okay

2382
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,280
okay

2383
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,199
okay so uh so i will print the

2384
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,440
prefix unreachable announcement and this

2385
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,560
is the

2386
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,960
maybe the first time to make the

2387
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,360
practice

2388
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,960
how to uh

2389
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,920
so here is a history of the proper the

2390
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,480
solution we probe we propose first and

2391
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,560
20 20 19 october in in

2392
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,560
singapore in idea for 106

2393
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,400
and also

2394
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,800
after several

2395
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,480
several item meetings

2396
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,280
and we also discussed the uh the

2397
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,480
solution intensely on the lsr list and

2398
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,040
previously we focused on both on the

2399
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,040
control plane and the data plane

2400
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:57,760
convergence and after discussion we we

2401
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,080
converted to the focus on the

2402
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,400
controversy

2403
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,400
switchover and we also discussed the uh

2404
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,560
intensely for the use case of the such

2405
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,360
information and i think

2406
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,400
kindly we all and will understand there

2407
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,719
are several several use cases

2408
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,159
need such useful information and uh

2409
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,800
online discussion there are also other

2410
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,800
alternative solution for example

2411
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,920
btp-based pulse and nlp

2412
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,320
and the upa just is

2413
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
introduced by peter

2414
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,199
and

2415
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,080
we we think the solution on converging

2416
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,639
for the pure and the ups solution now

2417
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,560
uh so here i just want to

2418
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,199
introduce the update content

2419
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,920
we we make the major

2420
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,760
update

2421
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,840
for the following content and the first

2422
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,639
is we describe briefly the applied

2423
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:57,760
scenarios

2424
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,119
so because in the mainly discussion

2425
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:04,080
many people wonder

2426
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,320
which which service will use such

2427
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,360
business so i think the foreign

2428
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,760
application

2429
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,520
can use the such a woman first in the

2430
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,080
pgp service and the second is the tunnel

2431
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,280
service

2432
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,040
and the third is the srv6 srv6 just also

2433
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,679
one kind of tunnel service so the p and

2434
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,639
the ps device will increase it in such a

2435
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:28,000
information so

2436
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,800
we think the pfd based solution and the

2437
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,540
other

2438
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,119
[Music]

2439
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:33,520
to um

2440
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,320
also and it's not as recent for the

2441
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,960
for the problem so we think the it-based

2442
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,520
solution may be more suitable

2443
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,159
and the root cause of the proper

2444
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,880
solution is the following and that is

2445
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,360
the samurais advertisement hide the

2446
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,719
unnecessary

2447
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:52,159
unreachable

2448
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,880
eligibility of its current prefix

2449
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,639
but the service that

2450
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,880
uh based on the

2451
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,360
detailed precipitate the prefix near to

2452
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,639
now the invisibility of this prefix to

2453
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,639
to switch over promptly to other

2454
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,360
alternative endpoint this is the root

2455
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,800
cause of the

2456
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,440
propelled solution and for resolution we

2457
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,440
need to also confine the negative

2458
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:18,800
advertisement to avoid in the igp

2459
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,040
flooding tour so

2460
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:24,719
i think many person may worry about the

2461
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,800
side effect of the such a notification

2462
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,320
so

2463
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,679
any any applications to the uh

2464
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,920
so consider this this carefully

2465
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
and the uh

2466
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,159
we updated the uh

2467
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:43,280
our solution is

2468
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,800
the uh the

2469
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,920
the the the message will um must declare

2470
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,280
the explicitly the associative prefix is

2471
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,639
unreachable uh with its prefix original

2472
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,080
certain law

2473
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,320
and the order to

2474
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,760
avoid the

2475
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,080
avoided the traditional router or

2476
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,360
unsupported

2477
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,280
uh misbehavior so we we set the uh

2478
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,560
associated metric to the lcd affinity

2479
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,280
so

2480
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,000
this can prevent the unspot node from

2481
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
misbehaving behavior

2482
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,400
i think such a uh

2483
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,600
such uh

2484
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,679
action

2485
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:25,760
is conformed to the uh

2486
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,719
rule of the are released rvc that is if

2487
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:32,800
you if the lsat carries uh the if if the

2488
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,760
method

2489
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,679
is of the lsa is ls infinity and then

2490
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:38,480
the

2491
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,320
spf for calculation will bypass the uh

2492
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:46,239
bypass will bypass the such lsa so uh

2493
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,199
the

2494
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:51,360
unsupported node will not misbehave so

2495
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,480
and

2496
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,520
we also define the capability

2497
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,760
bit for the negotiation of the static

2498
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,440
ability so if all nodes support the

2499
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,080
pa capability the ls infinity is

2500
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,080
unnecessary

2501
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,400
and the uh

2502
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,719
the second part for the updated solution

2503
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:13,360
is

2504
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,960
uh we we consider also the scenario that

2505
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,400
if only

2506
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,880
some of the abr can reach the maid in

2507
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,440
the prison that is when the network you

2508
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,199
participated

2509
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:28,880
participated so uh the abr account which

2510
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,199
the prefix should advertise the one

2511
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,920
specific route to the to the mission the

2512
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,159
prefix so

2513
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:40,320
this advertisement will let the traffic

2514
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,719
divert to the api that can reach the

2515
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,560
prefix

2516
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,119
and we also mentioned the switch over

2517
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,600
service switchover must take place only

2518
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,400
while all the adr advertises the same

2519
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,799
message

2520
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:58,960
we also

2521
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,320
make some

2522
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,000
update for the implementation

2523
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,199
consideration you know as i have

2524
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,880
mentioned the papers

2525
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,199
we must control the advertisement of

2526
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,440
such message within the

2527
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,679
area so we define the

2528
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,719
maxim maxi maxi address announcement

2529
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,679
shareholder to control the advertisement

2530
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,400
of the pua and the similar tests

2531
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,360
so

2532
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,280
if the number of the unreachable prefix

2533
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,040
is less than maa then adr can should

2534
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,080
advertise the summaries and the poi if

2535
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,600
reachable odds is less than ma the abr

2536
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,600
should advertise the detailed reach

2537
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,360
about this only

2538
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,400
and if both of the rich band unreachable

2539
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,480
prefix exit the ma then the and the abr

2540
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,960
should advertise the ma unreachable

2541
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,280
prefix and also set the same address

2542
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,400
with max

2543
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,000
metrics and

2544
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,480
at that time at the same time the vr's

2545
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,400
avr should notify the operator that

2546
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,880
there are several isn't occur within the

2547
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,440
network i think the the last uh uh

2548
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,320
last

2549
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:09,360
um scenario will be

2550
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,440
occurred only in the

2551
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,839
in the human network disaster so

2552
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,199
and uh

2553
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,320
so i think uh this stuff that has been

2554
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,679
discussed discussed about two years uh

2555
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,639
in the meeting on the main list so i

2556
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:29,520
think

2557
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,679
countries there are

2558
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:32,639
enough

2559
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,920
enough experts in switched this topic so

2560
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:36,960
we think

2561
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,639
it is time to move forward this document

2562
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:41,679
and

2563
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,800
we are glad to cooperate with peter to

2564
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,119
uh to make the uh

2565
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,560
make the overall

2566
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,600
overall solution to solve this problem

2567
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,560
and we are also welcome either closer

2568
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,040
to this uh this loss and the document

2569
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,000
okay that's all

2570
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,400
okay so um

2571
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,920
me and the queue as a working group

2572
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,600
member um or not i'm sorry back that up

2573
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,119
as a chair

2574
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:12,880
uh some of the comments i read on the

2575
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,480
list and maybe a little bit of the

2576
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,280
feeling in a couple of these slides

2577
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,280
uh

2578
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,360
it's been worked on for a long time yes

2579
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,280
because you know there hasn't been

2580
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,119
consensus

2581
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,920
and um there was a particular comment i

2582
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,480
saw that said you know

2583
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,159
it sort of like

2584
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,920
it was trying to justify this as the

2585
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,719
correct solution simply because

2586
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,040
it had been around longer and that

2587
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,280
that's never a reason

2588
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,119
that you know it has to be

2589
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,199
it has to be technically the best

2590
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,719
solution right

2591
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,360
it doesn't matter okay so i mean you you

2592
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,119
definitely uh

2593
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,360
we're there early on with this right

2594
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,679
that and that is something that should

2595
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,520
not go unnoticed

2596
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,520
but that doesn't yeah that doesn't you

2597
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,760
know favor your solution over a

2598
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,760
different solution just because you you

2599
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,480
know you recognize the problem first

2600
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,440
um

2601
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,199
so that was that's a chair comment um

2602
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:14,400
i i guess this is also uh you know the

2603
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,239
so it's good that you want to work with

2604
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,520
other people and i don't know if

2605
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,360
again if just because you started i

2606
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,960
don't know if this is the right document

2607
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,440
there seems to be a lot of

2608
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,920
uh commentary on the list about

2609
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,480
things like prefix originator and stuff

2610
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,480
that um

2611
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,719
you know people don't like right

2612
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,639
um

2613
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:39,679
so yeah i don't i don't know

2614
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,280
no yeah i i see yeah

2615
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,760
yeah uh you know

2616
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,040
you know we we also compare the uh to

2617
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,719
solution

2618
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,159
with peters and tier and upa i think the

2619
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:54,960
uh

2620
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,080
qa

2621
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,000
held a more complete

2622
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,719
uh complete complete consideration you

2623
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,280
know i think the indication of the

2624
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,239
unreachable information just one point

2625
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:09,679
of the overall solutions and we also we

2626
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,400
are also accept

2627
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,199
using other

2628
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,440
newly defined flag to indicate the

2629
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,119
unreachable prefix

2630
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,960
uh you know but uh

2631
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,320
this is um

2632
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,400
as i saw this is just a part of the

2633
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,920
solution and we

2634
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,679
our solution also cover other

2635
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:32,719
uh and you know this this is the

2636
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,199
point are discussed within the

2637
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,199
maintenance intensity so we hope that

2638
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:40,159
the traffic to include them i think the

2639
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,400
uh this is this is the main reason that

2640
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:47,440
we want to four this is solution okay

2641
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,000
yeah so um i there's no one else in the

2642
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,600
queue so i guess i'll just go again but

2643
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,000
this time as working remember i i did

2644
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,679
find it a little

2645
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,040
sort of

2646
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,400
funny that like

2647
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,400
you made a comment on peter's

2648
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,560
presentation about why ellis infinity

2649
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,159
wasn't good enough but it was good

2650
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,880
enough to put in your draft

2651
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,119
so it seems you know like

2652
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,639
is it good enough or is it not good

2653
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,400
enough right i mean

2654
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:16,559
that didn't seem very genuine to me

2655
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,760
uh

2656
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,440
peter's in the queue now

2657
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,639
so it's peter peter cisco so agent i

2658
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,320
mean

2659
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,679
we express many times that the mechanics

2660
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,760
that you use to signal unreachability in

2661
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,080
terms of advertising the originator as

2662
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,119
zero

2663
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,280
is broken

2664
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,600
i don't understand why you are still

2665
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,639
having that in your draft

2666
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,040
and the second comment i'm going to make

2667
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,600
when we started the draft i invited you

2668
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,360
and i acknowledge that you came up with

2669
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,800
the problems but you know with the

2670
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,040
problem space as a first i invited you

2671
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,840
to join the upa

2672
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,840
draft what you did instead

2673
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,000
you took and put the unreachability

2674
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,080
metric to your draft and still keeping

2675
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:00,880
your

2676
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,320
source or originator zero there

2677
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,719
i still honestly i don't know where are

2678
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,760
you heading with this

2679
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,280
yeah yeah the the we we also

2680
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,400
studied

2681
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,520
the possibility to use the newly defined

2682
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,880
flag

2683
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,960
to indicate the eligible information and

2684
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,080
i i also point out in the main list that

2685
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,159
for ospf of h3 there are limited space

2686
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:30,960
to

2687
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,639
to use to use in the flag if we rely on

2688
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,639
the flag we must extend the uh ospf v3

2689
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,800
flag first and then uh define the

2690
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,520
uh define the one bit to single the

2691
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,719
eligibility you know so if the ice we

2692
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,679
need okay go ahead

2693
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,280
yeah

2694
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,360
i think the

2695
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,400
we are open to to accept the

2696
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,159
uh our option for the ex accepting

2697
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:05,520
exactly indicate for the eligibility and

2698
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,000
but i think it is just one point of the

2699
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,280
overall solution you know um well there

2700
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,840
are other there are also other points

2701
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,000
that need to be considered

2702
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,639
consideration

2703
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:20,960
all you need is to signal unreachability

2704
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,199
you need a mechanism to that

2705
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,600
you put the unreachable metric you still

2706
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,920
want some explicit one the question

2707
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,920
whether we need an explicit one or not

2708
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,679
is something that we need to decide as a

2709
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:32,960
working group

2710
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,480
if we are going to decide we want to

2711
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,080
find another one not the one that you

2712
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,480
use for sure i'm still not convinced we

2713
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,560
need it but let's keep that as a as an

2714
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,520
option

2715
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,600
but then what is left in your draft

2716
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,040
right

2717
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,960
it's exactly the same thing as we have

2718
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,119
in the other draft where we just use the

2719
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,800
signal and reachability we don't need

2720
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,440
anything else

2721
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,800
no no

2722
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,199
we we need to control

2723
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,480
i think as you

2724
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,920
have said in your practice we need to

2725
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,239
define how to control the advertisement

2726
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:10,239
of the such information we need to

2727
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:13,199
kill the uh describe the situation when

2728
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,960
the network is participating

2729
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,920
participated so no i think i don't think

2730
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,119
so

2731
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:22,239
i don't believe so no

2732
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,119
there are possibilities to the network

2733
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,599
you know some apr can reachable and some

2734
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,679
apr can reach so

2735
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,159
such situation we need we all need to

2736
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,520
consider it

2737
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,840
you know the the single in just one

2738
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,679
point of the solution okay um

2739
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,000
i'm just going to break in because it

2740
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,239
seems to be a circular discussion here

2741
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,560
uh back and forth let's take the the

2742
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,480
point of whether or not explicit is

2743
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,719
needed i just wanted to point out that

2744
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,560
our agent said something wrong about

2745
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,199
ospf v3 if you're you weren't we

2746
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:59,280
wouldn't use the lsa options anyway we'd

2747
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,880
use some other flags and there are other

2748
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,719
flags that are extendable anyway

2749
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:08,239
sorry sorry peter uh odjin for breaking

2750
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:10,560
but let's go to the next one yep so

2751
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,880
we've got 10 minutes left uh and one

2752
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,760
presentation uh

2753
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,920
we need to get

2754
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,360
yes

2755
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,320
uh i think i have to stop you presenting

2756
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,840
maybe and then give it to you again so

2757
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,480
you can pick again

2758
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,800
and then offer

2759
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,639
now you should be able to select again

2760
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,119
wait a moment i i don't see the

2761
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,400
i don't i don't

2762
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,520
know

2763
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,480
i see that too i

2764
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,400
now it should work let's try that okay

2765
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,320
okay okay now okay

2766
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,119
i can select now

2767
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:57,119
yeah okay

2768
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,920
so okay

2769
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,280
yep

2770
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,560
yeah okay so this is the update for the

2771
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:13,199
advertisement of the staffing attribute

2772
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,000
so

2773
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,840
here i want to describe

2774
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,800
why we want to uh what is the proper one

2775
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,440
to solve you know uh here i just

2776
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,679
describe a swiss scenario at the way

2777
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,159
when we are in uh we are encountered in

2778
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:31,840
our network the first is the interest

2779
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,320
interest connections you know in such

2780
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,599
scenario

2781
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:39,040
the sdr um

2782
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:41,920
will build the pgp session with your low

2783
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,639
back of this and there are uh there are

2784
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,320
several uh

2785
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,040
interest link competition ram so we want

2786
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,880
to uh recover the uh interest topology

2787
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,239
within the

2788
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:55,840
the 2s

2789
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,760
the second scenario is

2790
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,119
for the

2791
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:01,520
internet exchange center you know there

2792
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,800
are maybe

2793
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,880
maybe several ways

2794
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,159
connect within by the line interface and

2795
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:09,520
we want to

2796
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,080
also discover the cover the

2797
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,480
interconnect topology within them the

2798
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,440
third scenario is for the uh

2799
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,599
any cost any customer service now you

2800
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,040
know uh

2801
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,719
some several servers with the same

2802
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:24,719
address may be connected

2803
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:25,679
in the

2804
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,080
different network um while the stop

2805
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,639
links so

2806
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:33,360
we want to define one container to

2807
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,440
transfer the characteristic of the stop

2808
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,320
links in about snails

2809
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,840
and to solve the

2810
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:44,239
2090 interest topology cover for example

2811
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:47,920
in the ptas and the oman is

2812
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,480
and also we want to do some traffic

2813
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,480
engineering to different servers based

2814
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,520
on the stubbling characteristics

2815
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,560
and

2816
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,679
at the main list point out the robot and

2817
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:02,800
there are also other um other scenarios

2818
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,920
that may help make uh it can use such

2819
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,639
information to select the

2820
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,880
best bgb pgp next hub we can end it

2821
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,400
later in the document

2822
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,159
so

2823
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:22,480
i think the the least plot active

2824
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,400
protocols

2825
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,040
is simple we just define one new

2826
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,520
container uh that is a new sub

2827
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:33,040
neutrality to contain the

2828
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,199
link type and the

2829
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:38,840
link prefix associated with the sub link

2830
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:42,000
so uh all all idp takes the similar

2831
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,040
format and we in this uh

2832
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,400
listing

2833
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,400
theory we defined the

2834
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,840
newly the link prefix subtly to contain

2835
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,119
the prefix of the stub link

2836
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,360
and this newly defined theory will be

2837
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,840
included in the correspond lsa and the

2838
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,040
pdo

2839
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,719
i'll pick as

2840
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:03,679
uh

2841
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,639
as a comment from the

2842
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:10,000
from captain we will we may change the

2843
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,440
container for uh for for this newly

2844
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:18,880
defined tlv to more general uh lsa

2845
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:19,599
and

2846
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:21,920
here we want to point out clearly that

2847
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:25,119
the prefix of trv is not the identifier

2848
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,679
of the stub link it is just one kind of

2849
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:31,199
the sub link attribute same as other

2850
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:33,520
already defined stably

2851
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,880
already defined

2852
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,679
sub sub tlv for the link attribute

2853
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,880
and here we

2854
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,320
is the reason that we do not want to

2855
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,560
use the existing container

2856
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,440
you know as we have

2857
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,360
discussed in the main list

2858
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,320
uh several times there are two rc define

2859
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,440
the

2860
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,280
t related

2861
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,239
uh

2862
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,119
theory to to contain such information

2863
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,599
about the interest link

2864
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,000
but these

2865
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,360
this

2866
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,920
subtlety must be present for every

2867
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,880
interest link for for example the remote

2868
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,199
s number and ipv4 and ipv6 remote sbr

2869
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,480
subtly

2870
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,639
so

2871
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:23,840
so if we

2872
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,679
uh solve the problem

2873
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,400
solve the problem based on these two rc

2874
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,639
uh for the 90s now

2875
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:32,880
then the then it will have the four

2876
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,239
links

2877
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,360
uh the first is not efficient for every

2878
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,639
interest

2879
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,000
stub link

2880
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,040
to include the redundant information

2881
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,239
and

2882
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,880
it is not possible to describe the line

2883
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,520
establishing is

2884
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,480
and

2885
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,000
for the

2886
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,800
uh for any cast server scenario

2887
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,119
we need we need some

2888
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:59,119
logical information to describe the stub

2889
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,760
link between s and the edge server

2890
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,480
and also point out uh by academy in the

2891
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,599
main list

2892
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:06,960
such as

2893
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,480
unnecessary information will be

2894
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:13,040
populated and unnecessary the t database

2895
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,639
so we we

2896
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,639
don't want to use

2897
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:17,760
against the

2898
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,679
rc to solve the problems

2899
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,360
so i think this is overlook

2900
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,800
our solution for the problem and uh

2901
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:31,920
also

2902
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,880
this solution helped pm uh

2903
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,119
what making working adoption for the

2904
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,199
first time under there

2905
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:42,000
i think the update contend has addressed

2906
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
the uh comment for gillian from the

2907
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
first adoption call and

2908
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,800
if there is no other no other comment

2909
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,679
occasion we can we ask to the working

2910
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,440
group to fold it again okay

2911
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,920
ac are you in the queue or was that just

2912
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,480
leftover

2913
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:08,480
yeah okay i'm off

2914
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:13,679
it was left over oh okay go ahead les

2915
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,080
the question is to the working chairs

2916
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:18,960
um

2917
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,760
this draft has been prevented multiple

2918
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,719
times

2919
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:25,040
it's been sketched extensively on the

2920
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,239
list

2921
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,239
there was a working group adoption call

2922
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,400
the conclusion of the group adoption

2923
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,520
call was not to adopt

2924
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,880
why are we still talking about this

2925
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,239
agent

2926
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:44,080
no no no the question is through the

2927
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,040
chair

2928
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,800
yeah okay well i'm completely

2929
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,080
understanding

2930
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,560
no less i'm curious as well my comment

2931
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,719
was going to address that actually but

2932
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,560
i'm sorry i apologize

2933
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,480
no no no no need to apologize you did

2934
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:59,599
ask the chair yeah yeah so as a i'll

2935
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:00,719
just say

2936
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:03,360
go ah hang on a second so we did

2937
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:06,320
everything les just said is true on the

2938
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,960
mailing list he said the same thing and

2939
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:11,199
you know there was words thrown around

2940
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:13,840
about baseless comments and

2941
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,840
they weren't baseless you know when the

2942
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,800
adoption call was failed

2943
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,199
i even asked you know

2944
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,840
please you know be very mindful before

2945
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,920
you bring this draft back

2946
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,320
you know the working group had given you

2947
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:31,119
an answer and the rough consensus was

2948
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:33,199
not to adopt

2949
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:35,599
and you know then we had

2950
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,599
more mailing you put out new versions

2951
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:39,440
and we had more mailing lists and you

2952
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,520
still hadn't convinced people

2953
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,679
we still don't have rough consensus and

2954
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,119
we're still spending working group

2955
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,040
resources on it

2956
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,040
i mean it's you know

2957
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:52,080
when is enough enough

2958
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,960
yeah correctly uh listen chris i think

2959
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:55,920
uh

2960
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,119
i want to explain you know the the the

2961
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:01,520
failure of the first topic is that there

2962
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,400
are some

2963
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:06,000
technical uh problem needs to solve and

2964
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,199
it's not

2965
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:08,159
not

2966
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,320
not because

2967
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:13,520
it is unnecessary so i think

2968
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,239
the reason we want to adopt someone

2969
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:18,400
properly that it can be used in the

2970
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:19,599
network

2971
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:20,320
and

2972
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,440
i i think it is common uh commons so now

2973
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,159
that

2974
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,280
some working some document be adopted

2975
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,719
several times

2976
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:31,760
based on the command from the uh

2977
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:33,920
from the adoption code process

2978
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,520
so i think

2979
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,360
we have updated the

2980
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,719
draft and to to

2981
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:44,480
address the command so if you have

2982
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,560
additional comments for the updated

2983
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,119
draft i think i can discuss with you if

2984
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:52,159
you have not i think it is right now

2985
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:56,199
to avoid it okay

2986
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,920
i'm not sure i followed that but

2987
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,840
if we could do that in email

2988
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,880
um

2989
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,320
i i

2990
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,880
yeah i think that i think we need to

2991
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,199
consider letting this one go because

2992
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,040
it's

2993
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,480
there are it's like you're trying to

2994
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,320
come up with a better solution that is

2995
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,440
you know

2996
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,199
prettier or something and you know i

2997
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,360
appreciate that but like you keep

2998
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,960
talking about here there's a way to do

2999
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,239
it this way and there's a way to solve

3000
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:26,000
this other problem this way in other

3001
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,639
words solutions exist right

3002
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:29,599
and

3003
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,440
you you're trying to make a better

3004
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,679
cleaner solution but people aren't

3005
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:36,080
biting right they don't they don't think

3006
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,480
it's worth doing

3007
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:42,320
no i i think the

3008
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:43,520
uh

3009
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,800
the the the

3010
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,119
final year

3011
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:48,320
okay

3012
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:49,760
yeah i mean

3013
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,080
one sentence and i think the final user

3014
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:55,119
for the every every proposal

3015
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:56,960
in the service provider i think the

3016
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,400
third part has

3017
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,840
more um more more right to

3018
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,119
uh to

3019
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:05,119
to declare or to

3020
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:06,560
hazard

3021
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,000
is it necessary or not okay

3022
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,960
well you're right we give a lot of

3023
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,159
weight to service providers opinions um

3024
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:17,280
but

3025
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,360
they still have to come with technical

3026
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,040
reasons and

3027
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,040
those haven't been shown that the

3028
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,280
current solutions aren't

3029
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,040
good enough

3030
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,719
anyway so

3031
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:30,480

3032
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:34,560
but we're out of time um it's 1201
