1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
oh

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
testing here we go this one's good so

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
this is for the person who is going to

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,840
be

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
asking questions probably

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,679
if anyone remote wants to pop in and say

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,640
hello that would be great

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
oh

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,399
and this is the presenter microphone now

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
switched on that actually works

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,519
hey robert

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,520
just saying hello for the microphone

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,760
test

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
that works really well thank you

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,440
and finally this is

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
yeah it seems to me um this one the

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
chair microphone we can't hear inside

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
the room so presumably they can't hit

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
remotely either there's a comment in the

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,119
chat

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
this microphone is a lot less loud can

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
you hear us remotely

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
not a whole lot

24
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,840
but

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,240
you are audible

26
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,479
okay i think what we've been instructed

27
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
to do is basically swallow the mic so

28
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
that's what we'll do and as long as

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
this level is okay for the folks

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,478
remotely i think we'll get started

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
yes when you eat the microphone it's

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
fine

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
all right welcome to monday afternoon

um in terms of resources for

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
philadelphia uh the uh comment in the

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
chat is that

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
zulip is the

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,319
current choice that's right

74
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
uh there's a link at the bottom clients

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,440
do work

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
the agenda is posted online and in the

77
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,200
data tracker

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
it's also on the

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
sedate information website

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
in terms of

81
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,439
meat echo there's lots of material there

82
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
don't need to really talk about that

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
so in terms of resources for our work

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,879
as i said

85
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
zulip is the um

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
is the choice here we will be keeping

87
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
notes but i want to encourage you to add

88
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
to the notes

89
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
uh in fact i'm going to rely on braun

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
pretty much to do most of the

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
note-taking uh from the chair

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
and then but i would certainly welcome

93
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
people who are in person or people who

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
are working remotely to add to the notes

95
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
as we go along that would be very

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
helpful um our uh mailing list is on the

97
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,560
screen i won't say anything more about

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
that

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
uh and once again for the people who are

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,440
here local there is the long uri for the

101
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
onsite tool

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
in terms of the agenda it's very simple

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
uh

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
i will open it up for agenda bashing but

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
i would be shocked if there was much

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
agenda bashing here we have a very quick

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,400
presentation on our liaison

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
that should not take very long the

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
dominant item on our agenda is to get

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
our draft going

111
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
and i will be turning it over to carsten

112
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
for that

113
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
and uh and then we'll have a short

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
amount of time for any other business

115
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
one of the things the chairs will ask

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
the assembled group

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
is whether or not we should consider uh

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
an interim in order to make further

119
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,520
progress on getting this draft done

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,199
so let me pause here and see if there is

121
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
any concerns about the agenda or if we

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,080
can just proceed

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
okay cool uh i don't hear any comments

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
and there are none here in the room so

125
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,120
we're going to move forward

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
so we have um

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
uh a short presentation about our

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
liaison issues let me bring that up i

129
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,759
can actually do the slides if that's

130
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,080
okay

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,039
and

132
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,440

172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
working group

173
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
and um

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
since 113 we had

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,520
a version of four of the document

176
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,319
that added the offset time zone

177
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,960
uh syntax so we can have time zone hints

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
both with a time zone

179
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,919
name

180
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,759
and with a numeric

181
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
time zone this is kind of a specialty

182
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,080
and not exactly recommended but it's

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
needed to be compatible

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,879
with

185
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
what's out there

186
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
and in a dash of five

187
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
we added a critical flag so we have a

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
way to

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
identify a hint as something that's

190
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,799
actually not just a hint but critical

191
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,039
and we added

192
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
one

193
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
example for

194
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,919
how to extend uh the format

195
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
because if you don't provide an example

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
then people won't know what to do and

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
they actually won't implement it so we

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
have to have at least one

199
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,640
example

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,600
and we decided to use the the calendar

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
format

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
as a hint

203
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
based on cldr and i forgot what that

204
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
abbreviation stands for but it's the

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
unicode

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
registry of

207
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,839
various

208
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,399
uh localizing information and that also

209
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,440
includes

210
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
calendar formats

211
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
and finally we had a little bike shed

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
here the thing needed a name

213
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
and we came up with internet extended

214
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
day type format and

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
yeah you can argue whether that's a

216
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
serious proposal or just the

217
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
the scare

218
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
proposal we put up so people generate

219
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
better proposals

220
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
than that but if we don't have a

221
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,360
better proposal then we can certainly

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
live

223
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
with that

224
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
name

225
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,040
so

226
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
looking at where we are um

227
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
are we done and

228
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,640
i think the answer is yes

229
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
so if we take what we were chartered to

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,200
do

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,440
we can say we have ticked off all those

232
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
check marks

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
at least the the big ones there there's

234
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
a little bit of editorial charts

235
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,800
remaining

236
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
the abn f may need another

237
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,760
combing through

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
um there may be a little bit too little

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
detail about the calendar

240
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
uh format

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
and we also had a discussion on the list

242
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,360
about

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
suffix key limiting suffix keys to

244
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
lowercase so these are three

245
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,720
things that could be in a dash or six

246
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,760
and uh that then we would be done

247
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
except

248
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
uh for issue number 17 and i think

249
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
that's the the interesting one

250
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,880
that we need to address uh during

251
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,440
uh this meeting

252
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
and

253
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,079
what is

254
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,720
issue 17 well it's the the elephant in

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
the room

256
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,959
what do we do when we have conflicts

257
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,560
between the

258
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
the semantic information that is in the

259
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
timestamp

260
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
well i think we have all agreed that

261
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
that is always the the information that

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
is

263
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,160
uh relevant so the ut utc referenced

264
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
a point in time that that's always what

265
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
uh

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
um

267
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
what was the abbreviation

268
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
uh

269
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
hello

270
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
um

271
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
the format means

272
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
and um then we have the time zone offset

273
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,320
which has a very well defined meaning in

274
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,440
33 9. and one interesting observation is

275
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
that 339 defines a time zone offset of

276
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
minus

277
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,440
zero that doesn't seem to exist in iso

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
8601 and we will see where

279
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
that that headset hits us in a minute

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
so this this is all well understood but

281
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,320
then we might have a time zone hint like

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
euro paris

283
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
and that may actually be in conflict

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
with the time zone offset that that is

285
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
so clearly defined by 39

286
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,760
and i think we now agree that this is

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,519
exactly the point

288
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
uh identifying

289
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
the conflict

290
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,079
and

291
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
allowing the recipient of this

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
information

293
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
to start

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
resolving that conflict for instance by

295
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
by asking a

296
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,120
user how this

297
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
timestamp is actually supposed to be

298
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
interpreted

299
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,920
so this is uh well maybe not totally

300
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
uncontroversial but at least

301
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,600
uh well understood

302
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
um

303
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
the the question really is

304
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
um

305
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
how do we

306
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,880
handle the the way 339

307
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
is actually implemented

308
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,639
out there in in real world

309
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
libraries and in particular in the

310
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,600
javascript

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
libraries and the temporal project

312
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
your audio is breaking up badly do you

313
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
want to disconnect and reconnect audio

314
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
and see if that helps

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
i can do that

316
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
i can simply change browsers one second

317
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,680
all right

318
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
well we're just sitting around does

319
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
anyone have anything they want to talk

320
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
about

321
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,599
see how that hits net

322
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
respect

323
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,399
uh i think we need to hear uh the

324
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,160
proposal that carson's going to make in

325
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
a couple of minutes before

326
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
uh we started discussing

327
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
i was just hoping someone might get up

328
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
to the microphone with a joke or you

329
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
know

330
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,959
interpretive dance or something

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,519
so is my audio better now

332
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,160
that's much better thanks carson

333
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
okay so i went from safari to chrome

334
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,079
um

335
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,040
can you

336
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
show some slides again i think we

337
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
lost that

338
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,880
oh i have to do that sorry

339
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
okay so we were just discussing this

340
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
this

341
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
conflict issue

342
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
and the fact that

343
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,880
uh the implementation of 359 in the wild

344
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
may be a little bit different from what

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,600
it

346
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
actually says

347
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
so if you look into three two three nine

348
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
it defines zed

349
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
uh which is time time zone uh time

350
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
offset zero

351
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,959
as a synonym for plus zero zero

352
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,720
zero zero

353
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
uh which

354
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,199
makes sense

355
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
but

356
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,759
the the implementations out there

357
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,399
often have a problem in that they are

358
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,480
also trying to be iso 8601 compatible

359
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,320
and iso 8601 doesn't seem to provide for

360
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
-0

361
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
which is essentially the absence

362
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,680
um of a time zone hint so the the um

363
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,399
we have a timestamp which is utc

364
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
reference

365
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
but we don't actually say which time

366
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,600
zone is actually implied with that

367
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
so they have the problem that of the

368
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,959
three

369
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,720
zero valued

370
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
offsets

371
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
they only can implement two

372
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
z and plus zero and

373
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,399
they decide

374
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
that the the one they don't get the

375
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,759
minus 0

376
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
is then given to the

377
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
z to the z

378
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
character

379
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,000
so this is uh uh what wg would say

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
willful deviation

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,359
uh from what uh 339 says

382
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,880
uh but it seems to feel quite natural to

383
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
to people doing this

384
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,119
um so this is actually what

385
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,160
implementations out there did and in ish

386
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
in in pull request 19 you actually can

387
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
find

388
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
a little survey that justin grant has

389
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,799
done

390
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,520
uh what various implementations of

391
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
339

392
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
time zones do

393
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
and

394
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
the the predominant interpretation of z

395
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
seems to be

396
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,039
a no time

397
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
zone offset implied so that what

398
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,039
three two three nine calls minus zero

399
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,600
and if you want to have

400
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,160
a time zone offset implied

401
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
you use plus

402
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
zero and if you don't you

403
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,520
use

404
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
uh z

405
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
so we have a

406
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,039
difference here between what what's uh

407
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,440
described in 239

408
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
and

409
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
the libraries we find in the part of the

410
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
world that really wants to use

411
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
those extensions that we are building

412
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
so that of course increases the

413
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
confusion because we

414
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
now know

415
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
not only have the conflicts the

416
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,960
potential conflicts between the time

417
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
zone

418
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
hint

419
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
and the

420
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,400
59 offset information but we also have a

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
deviating

422
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
interpretation of that offset

423
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,039
information

424
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
and that that is pretty much

425
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,760
not a situation that that can be rescued

426
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,919
you don't get interoperability

427
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,000
uh when when you

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
do that

429
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
um

430
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,880
so um again uh if you look into progress

431
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
19 the discussion they are provides a

432
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
survey of

433
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,919
various platform time data types

434
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,360
and and those

435
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,520
have this uh interesting uh problem

436
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
so what we could say is uh yeah these

437
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
these are all just deviating

438
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
implementations and we don't care about

439
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
them and 39

440
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
really defines how the world should be

441
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
and the part of the world does that

442
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
doesn't

443
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
implement this right well it's it's

444
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
their problem and so on

445
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
um but there is also another

446
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
possibility and uh

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,559
the radical proposal

448
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
we do the same thing and

449
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,400
we say okay if you have a z

450
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
or z

451
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,080
this is to be interpreted as a minus

452
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
zero

453
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
according to a three two three nine

454
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,799
and

455
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,679
we

456
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,799
if we actually want to

457
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
define

458
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
a time zone offset

459
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
we do this with

460
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,760
plus

461
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,679
zero

462
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
so that is based on the assumption that

463
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,679
still needs to be verified

464
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,320
that this actually is the consensus in

465
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
the implementations

466
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
um and we have this nice survey from

467
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
justin but i think we we

468
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
actually have to cast a slightly wider

469
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,080
net

470
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,400
before we uh

471
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
say this this is really what people out

472
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
there are uh doing

473
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,360
then the second question is

474
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
is actually authorized to make this

475
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
change because as a working group we are

476
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
certainly not

477
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,480
and uh so we probably would have to have

478
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
a discussion

479
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
outside the working group

480
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
and unfortunately there's nobody we can

481
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,520
talk to because the 39 is uh

482
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
um

483
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
well not exactly ancient but it has been

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
around for a while

485
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
um so uh we are not exactly in a

486
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
position to to talk to another working

487
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
group that

488
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,159
has all the people who made these

489
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,280
decisions

490
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,200
sitting there with the reasons for that

491
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
fresh in their minds and so on

492
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,240
and that's maybe one question i have no

493
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
idea whether that's useful in any way

494
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
um

495
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
does iso tc154

496
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
maybe actually have an

497
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
opinion to that

498
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,799
it's always dangerous to to use liaisons

499
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,679
this way but maybe we can

500
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,440
get some some semi-formal

501
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
information from from people

502
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,799
like that and we certainly need

503
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,000
more

504
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
statements from the temporal people and

505
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
and other people who do

506
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,679
libraries for 59

507
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
time stamps

508
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,039
so this is really the the question

509
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,760
um and i'm posing this question as as an

510
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
editor here

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,080
i personally

512
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
really don't care about iso 8601

513
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
so

514
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
i personally would say well 539 rules

515
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
and no we do don't do any of this

516
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,640
but

517
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
i think we also have to think about what

518
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,799
what will happen with this

519
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,200
uh out there in reality and urge wall is

520
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
in the queue

521
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,679
yeah carson just about

522
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,640
a tiny note about the remark about not

523
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
caring about iso

524
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
8601 that's

525
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
understandable however you have to also

526
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,919
understand that implementations

527
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,960
generally

528
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
do not get that choice

529
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,799
uh and and you know in order to be

530
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
maximally compatible

531
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,240
they

532
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
they would have to

533
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,320
stick to behavior that is permitted by

534
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,200
both

535
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,159
uh

536
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
339 uh

537
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,120
or

538
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
you know 339 bis

539
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,799
and

540
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,120
8601 which means

541
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,200
which of course is the

542
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,360
reason they do the whole z behavior

543
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
yeah i think the the the

544
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
um

545
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,919
the way they are being compatible to to

546
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,240
8601 and 239

547
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,760
is avoiding the syntax error

548
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
while at the same time

549
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
ignoring the semantics

550
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,360
and

551
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
that's certainly one way to get things

552
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
uh going

553
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,399
uh justin

554
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,679
first of all thanks for including me um

555
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,480
uh just a few notes on the survey that i

556
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,200
did what i did is i looked for other

557
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
platform libraries and i think i looked

558
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,120
at maybe 10 or so

559
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
and then took the subset of those that

560
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
actually had a time stamp type right

561
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,799
where it um uh uh you know the the

562
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,320
equivalent to what 3339 does or the the

563
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,679
full iso 8601 that that records an

564
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,000
instant in time without a time zone and

565
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,480
then i look for well how are those

566
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
uh how are those types serialized

567
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,320
and i was unable to find any examples of

568
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,720
serialization that used the minus zero

569
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
zero zero

570
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
and all the ones that i looked at used z

571
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,840
for that purpose and so i was trying to

572
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,880
understand sort of why that was and my

573
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
assumption is if you're just looking at

574
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
a time stamp

575
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
there is no conflict right where the the

576
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
whole the whole the only reason you have

577
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,559
a time stamp is to record an instant in

578
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,240
time if you if you don't know the time

579
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
zone information it sort of doesn't

580
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,720
matter that much when you're serializing

581
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
it whether you use z or

582
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
plus zero zero zero or for that matter

583
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,360
minus zero zero it all has the same

584
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
meaning unless there's a time zone

585
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,320
involved and so my assumption is is that

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
the designers of all these libraries

587
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
again this is all water under the bridge

588
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
it's already been designed in some cases

589
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,439
you know 10 plus years ago

590
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
chose to use the shorter and more

591
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
compatible serialization of z

592
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,120
um as opposed to the minus zero zero

593
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,360
which would be incompatible or the plus

594
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
zero zero zero which would be longer um

595
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
and

596
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,159
so so again it's hard to to understand

597
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
without really digging into the details

598
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
of sort of how each of these libraries

599
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
was designed but that's my best guess

600
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
and the other comment i had is

601
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,279
i'm not sure this i think demolish

602
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,919
rfc 3339 is a little too uh too bold

603
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,760
in that from the purpose of three

604
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,000
through three nine they are equivalent

605
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,360
all three of these zero values

606
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,679
i mean i guess excuse me i got that

607
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,480
wrong

608
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
z and plus zero zero mean the same thing

609
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,320
from the perspective of three three

610
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
through nine because three three three

611
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
nine does not

612
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,799
uh does not assert that that anything

613
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,200
that that there's any meaning of of the

614
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
the string other than a time stamp and

615
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
so the

616
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
uh

617
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,159
you know it only really becomes

618
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,240
different when you start to add time

619
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,640
zones to it and so because time zones

620
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
are out of the scope of three through

621
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,120
three nine i'm not sure that we're

622
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,400
actually breaking anything and so i i

623
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
totally am open to feedback on that but

624
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
that that's my sense is that you know

625
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,720
339 continues to exist continues to be

626
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,440
valid when you add a time zone

627
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
that's actually when which is the whole

628
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,600
purpose of this new spec is when you

629
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,440
need to really draw that that difference

630
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
well

631
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
yeah so i

632
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
i copied the the

633
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,440
uh section 4.3

634
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
uh into the chat

635
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
and

636
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,679
this is what gives semantics to minus

637
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,360
0 0

638
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
0 0

639
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,559
and

640
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,600
it's trying to say that

641
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
an unknown

642
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,159
offset to local time is expressed with

643
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,600
-0

644
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,159
and a known offset it can be expressed

645
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,039
with

646
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,080
both z and plus zero

647
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,840
and they say both z and plus zero

648
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,480
imply that utc is the preferred

649
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,520
reference point for the specified time

650
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,279
so we we do have a pretty clear

651
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,799
statement

652
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
from 539

653
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,799
of course you're right

654
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,279
that this doesn't

655
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,399
prescribe

656
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,480
how an implementation actually is

657
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
supposed to

658
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
use this information and

659
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
maybe implementations actually did have

660
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,480
some leeway in in not actually making

661
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
use of the information that is

662
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,640
encoded in the timestamp

663
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,159
uh but yeah i think we we are at least

664
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,360
changing this section 4.3

665
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,520
um if we say z really uh goes into the

666
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
same group of unknown

667
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
uh local time

668
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,399
offset so i have a lot of sympathy for

669
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,480
for that change it makes a lot of sense

670
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
to me

671
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
um but then uh

672
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,840
359

673
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,559
has been around for a while uh and it's

674
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,440
just uh celebrating its 20th birthday

675
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,279
these days

676
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
so we should have some some very good

677
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,799
reason to to change that

678
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
go ahead

679
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,760
uh okay i i think braun wanted to go

680
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,240
first but real quick uh just a comment

681
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,520
on on what you said question i i

682
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
understand that

683
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,679
339 has been around for for quite a

684
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,559
while

685
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,880
but the fact that

686
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,440
this has been an inconsistency for so

687
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,320
long

688
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,279
is

689
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,200
i i i i

690
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
it makes me feel

691
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,360
exactly the opposite way about this

692
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,480
which is that okay for

693
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
say last 20 years

694
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,559
implementations have been

695
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,279
confused with what to do because these

696
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,080
two

697
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,840
standards one of which is supposed to be

698
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
a profile of the other are

699
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,039
inconsistent and they have to do

700
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
something which is technically not

701
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
permitted by either

702
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,600
uh

703
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
just to have maximum compatibility

704
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,520
uh

705
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
and

706
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,200
and

707
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,799
the longer this

708
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,600
situation continues it's the the worse

709
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
it is and that if we

710
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,559
quote unquote fix the world by

711
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
by making

712
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
the standards compatible again in in a

713
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,919
simple way that would be a great step

714
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
and moving forwards

715
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,080
uh implementations would be easier to

716
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,279
write and and would not have to rely

717
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,200
essentially on unspecified behavior

718
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
i'm just going to pop this microphone

719
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
because it's closer um i pretty much

720
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
agree with that and also i would say

721
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,240
that it is clear from the survey that's

722
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,919
been done that

723
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
we're already using z to mean minus zero

724
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,880
zero zero zero in pretty much everything

725
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,440
that's shipped at the moment um in which

726
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,720
case

727
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,440
either updating 3339 with just that

728
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
individual thing or at least filing in a

729
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
writer against it saying this is this

730
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
standard is not being used in the way

731
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,679
it's been written

732
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,799
um is the right answer here and

733
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,799
so i i think this is the right thing to

734
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,399
do our area director is in the room

735
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,518
though his head's in his laptop

736
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,640
what do you think murray i'm sorry i was

737
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,159
dealing with something else can you

738
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,880
reform the question for me sure uh so

739
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,679
the basic issue here is that the zed

740
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,960
which says time zones in utc

741
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,760
is is being used to say we don't know

742
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
the exact time zone

743
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,360
more probably than to say this must be

744
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
in utc

745
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
um

746
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
do we need to update 3339

747
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
to change that given the text explicitly

748
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,159
says that it means the same as plus zero

749
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,519
zero zero

750
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,200
maybe um

751
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,840
what should we do

752
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,480
and the first question is is that really

753
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
the consensus of the implementations

754
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,159
uh

755
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
how do we determine that

756
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
because arthritis did launch so justin

757
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,360
did some research on this yeah and

758
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
that's how it was being used right okay

759
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
um who's authorized to demolish 3339

760
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,000
that

761
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,039
i have to look at the history but i

762
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,279
think that came from a working group and

763
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,919
it's just a profile

764
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,320
if i remember correctly so this working

765
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,399
group could do that as far as i know

766
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,719
um

767
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
let me let's hear what usual has to say

768
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
then i'll keep rambling the the problem

769
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,880
here really is that 339 did something

770
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
that iso 8601 doesn't allow

771
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,559
and that's why it hasn't been

772
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,000
implemented

773
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
as much as you would like it

774
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
and it's it's weird that this comes out

775
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,080
20 years later

776
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,480
yeah but that's what we have at the

777
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,640
moment and we're looking to correct that

778
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,760
go ahead usual

779
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,320
yeah i i was going to say that

780
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,000
i i was wondering if the fact that 3339

781
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,279
is supposed to be a profile of 8601 and

782
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,440
still does something which is not

783
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,799
allowed by the base standard is that

784
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,200
good enough grounds for us to

785
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
go to demolish 3339

786
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,559
i think i'm interested in backward

787
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,399
compatibility if we do that

788
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,320
does anything break does anything depend

789
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
on the change we made that isn't in the

790
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,559
base spec

791
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,279
i

792
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,080
do not think based on the the survey

793
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,519
that justin did

794
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,360
anything would break

795
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
as a matter of fact would fix this

796
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
inconsistency which would make it easier

797
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
for implementers

798
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
to conform to both standards by just

799
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,159
sticking to the smaller subset which is

800
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,720
33.39

801
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,799
and the third question on here before i

802
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,480
let i guess justin's on there um

803
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
we could ask the liaison if the liaison

804
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
concurs or if tc154 concurs

805
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
that this would not be a breaking thing

806
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
or that they have no reason to you know

807
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
tell us we shouldn't do that

808
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,080
uh go ahead justin

809
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
jimmy brown do you wanna uh do you wanna

810
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,880
talk

811
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,840
sorry no i'll i'll take myself back out

812
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,199
of the queue yeah

813
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,560
okay

814
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,599
um

815
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
so so the one thing i'd recommend is i

816
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,800
don't think you should remove the minus

817
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
zero zero zero zero from three three

818
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,399
three nine in other words that's been

819
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,239
around for 20 years if anybody's using

820
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,399
it i i didn't find anybody using it but

821
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
i'm sure there is somebody out there who

822
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,199
has so i would strongly recommend we not

823
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,560
take that out

824
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,800
but rather i think it would make sense

825
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,359
to acknowledge that in the 20 years

826
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,760
since then the industry has essentially

827
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
voted with their feet around a

828
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
particular implementation of z

829
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,879
that is also useful in what we're doing

830
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,599
here which is to include a time zone

831
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
hint along with a

832
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,239
time stamp right so it's sort of like uh

833
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,879
um you know like like evolution right in

834
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,119
a in a cave where some sometimes the

835
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,480
animals lose their eyes and sometimes

836
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
they don't but it doesn't matter because

837
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
it's dark and then some then the animals

838
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,440
get out of the cave and they're like oh

839
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,359
i have eyes and i don't right i think

840
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,760
this is an example of that right where

841
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
it kind of didn't matter very much until

842
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,079
now and now it matters more and so

843
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,160
i think it would make sense to

844
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,640
acknowledge the way the industry is

845
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,599
uh

846
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,760
has kind of voted so far but i wouldn't

847
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
break backwards compatibility nor do i

848
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
actually think that this makes it

849
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
incompatible as well in other words

850
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
as far as i could tell this is undefined

851
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
behavior in other words does the

852
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,680
uh

853
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,240
does he require you to

854
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,359
to assert that the local time is a

855
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,800
particular human time zone uh i'm not

856
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,640
convinced that that spec is clear the

857
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,200
3329 is even clear enough now that

858
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,240
that's

859
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
that's the case it's clear that the

860
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,839
offset means that the um you know it's

861
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,599
relative to utc but that's different

862
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,160
from from asserting that hey this is a

863
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,359
real human time zone that you can pull

864
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,760
out for instance the local time in there

865
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
and display it to an end user as if it

866
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,640
was the the real time that was was

867
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
asserted so from my perspective it

868
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,119
doesn't feel like we're creating a

869
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,599
backwards incompatibility but rather uh

870
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,079
defining something that is either poorly

871
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,599
defined or undefined in the current spec

872
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,520
and i'll take myself off the cube

873
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
um

874
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,720
i'm trying to i'm fishing around in my

875
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,480
head for other inputs about how to guide

876
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
this decision um one of the things we

877
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,240
say when we move from

878
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
proposed standard to internet standard

879
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
or the full standard whichever the

880
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,040
highest one is

881
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
you remove stuff that is nobody's

882
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,320
implementing

883
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
before you can advance it to the next

884
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
level you have to do that and so that

885
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,320
might be a consideration here um so for

886
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,000
the second question who's authorized to

887
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,160
demolish 3339 this this working group is

888
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,079
chartered properly to to do that sort of

889
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,400
work um i think that if we're really

890
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
worried about this um

891
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
a little bit of exposition in the

892
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
document that explains you know the

893
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,960
history that we've just been talking

894
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
about in the last five minutes would be

895
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,359
not harmful to include um and then on

896
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,359
the first and third bullets i mean

897
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,800
if you can demonstrate either be the

898
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
history of the list or the in more

899
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,079
exposition in the document that says

900
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,520
look we looked at all these angles this

901
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
is the right thing to do this is the

902
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,760
justification for the decision

903
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,000
i think that you make an airtight case

904
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
like that then it's gonna be fine so you

905
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,839
you can proceed with this if you once

906
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,320
you've done all the homework

907
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,560
let me first look for other comments

908
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,799
here

909
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
and if i don't get other comments what

910
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
i'm going to do is

911
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
usual go ahead

912
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,720
uh no sorry mark please feel free i i

913
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,320
could conclude

914
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,359
okay

915
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,839
um because what i'd like to do is come

916
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,359
up with a

917
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,200
crisp statement of what we're going to

918
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,680
do next um i think uh i think the chairs

919
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,079
have sort of an informal sense that

920
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,960
there is some convergence going on here

921
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,640
um uh and what i'd like to do is have

922
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,839
a crisp description

923
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,560
of

924
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
what we've just decided to do and the

925
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,119
guidance that we've gotten from our a.d

926
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,920
um

927
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,359
uh and

928
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,079
and to make carsten slide about the fact

929
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,800
that we are done to make that come true

930
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,680
so

931
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,520
if someone wants to step in here and

932
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,440
provide that crisp description i think

933
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
the chairs would appreciate that

934
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,599
uh perfect

935
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,440
can i attempt to do that please do yes

936
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,000
okay great uh yeah thank you for the

937
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
conversation first of all it's i

938
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,760
uh

939
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
i'm really glad with all the points that

940
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,720
we raised i think there is more or less

941
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,200
consensus within at least the group of

942
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
people that we have here

943
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,280
that this is

944
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,320
uh

945
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
something

946
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,200
that is not a bad idea

947
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,119
uh at the very least

948
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,560
i i

949
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
i propose that

950
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,720
we for uh at least for the

951
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,160
uh for this draft not sure how if we

952
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,040
should

953
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,839
do

954
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,880
anything on the 3339 side but at least

955
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,720
for this draft it makes sense to

956
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,000
uh

957
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
to

958
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
semantically assert

959
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,440
the

960
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,440
uh the the presence of z as a

961
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
uh sort of

962
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,320
null value in the sense that it implies

963
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,440
that

964
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
uh

965
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,000
the

966
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,400
the the uh

967
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,480
exact offset was unknown and that you

968
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
should rely on

969
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
the uh

970
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,720
the suffix if if any for that uh

971
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,079
and yeah editorially uh there there's

972
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,839
already some guidance i i suppose

973
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,440
there's many comments about including

974
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,319
some examples to make it clear and

975
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,640
so on we could also include notes

976
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,119
including uh the

977
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,040
survey we did to

978
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,160
uh

979
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,960
drive the point uh

980
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,520
and yeah with that i feel it should be

981
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,240
convincing enough

982
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,040
so as as an editor of the document

983
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,279
um

984
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,319
what i would do next

985
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,280
is make a pull request

986
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,960
that adds a section that updates

987
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,520
3339

988
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,040
by

989
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,640
um

990
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,920
weakening the semantics of zed right now

991
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
that is

992
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,000
supposed to say this is

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,359
your your local time offset and the the

994
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,200
update would say this is not what people

995
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,119
have implemented

996
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,760
so please don't rely on on that actually

997
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,119
meaning that

998
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,800
so that would be the the update to 33

999
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
9

1000
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
and for for this

1001
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,800
specification

1002
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
we would

1003
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,560
indicate that

1004
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,680
minus

1005
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,040
0 0

1006
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,920
0 0 is often

1007
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,319
not implemented so it provides less

1008
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,400
interoperability

1009
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,800
than using the the new semantics for

1010
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,760
z that is defined in the update

1011
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,160
for 33 9

1012
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,839
and then we have a good basis to

1013
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,280
actually complete

1014
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,760
the conflict

1015
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
text

1016
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,920
that i think is already quite good but

1017
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,599
but maybe could take another round of

1018
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,240
editorial updating

1019
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
i'll just put myself back in the queue i

1020
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
guess to ask a question to the room

1021
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,680
about your understanding of this to make

1022
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,359
sure we we do all understand the same

1023
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,400
thing

1024
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,720
um the time that this well let's let's

1025
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,040
just say midday today here

1026
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,000
in in the east coast u.s time

1027
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
would have been

1028
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,480
if converted to utc would have been 1600

1029
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,160
so if you saw something that said 1600 z

1030
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,480
time zone

1031
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,920
usa or america new york

1032
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,319
what time would you consider that to be

1033
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,079
if it if it said

1034
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,560
1600 zed

1035
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
america new york would you consider that

1036
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,079
to be midday in america new york or

1037
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,520
would you consider it to be 4 p.m in

1038
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,319
america new york

1039
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,040
go ahead justin

1040
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,319
hold on let me get my audio can you can

1041
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,280
you hear me okay

1042
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,640
uh so so i i i think the answer in it

1043
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,200
unfortunately i i uh my mental

1044
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,520
arithmetic is

1045
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,079
not as good as yours but um

1046
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:08,880
uh

1047
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,960
my understanding is if the zed is on

1048
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
there then the string

1049
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,000
the the the local time shown before the

1050
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,960
zed

1051
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,200
is not meant to imply

1052
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,760
a real human local time but rather it's

1053
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
meant to defer to the time zone hint to

1054
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,280
determine what the local time actually

1055
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
is so the

1056
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,960
the instant always stays the same right

1057
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,200
the the point in universal time

1058
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,280
regardless of the time zone but having

1059
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,920
the z there implies that a there can

1060
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,680
never be a conflict

1061
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,440
right because you're not making an

1062
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,079
assertion about the local time nor the

1063
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,640
the offset when it was was gathered and

1064
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,800
b that you should defer to the to the

1065
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,599
time zone hint to determine the uh the

1066
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,440
time does that match what you were i

1067
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,520
don't understand what you mean by that

1068
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,599
um if just for the date 10 years in the

1069
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,599
future and the usa decided not to do

1070
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,760
daylight savings would that mean that it

1071
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,000
would meant 11 a.m

1072
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,640
here in new york or in

1073
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
pennsylvania and philadelphia would it

1074
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,599
mean that it meant midday like that's

1075
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,119
that's the the whole question with all

1076
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,240
of this is how do we disambiguate this

1077
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,400
and is the time there the local time or

1078
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,119
not or has it had an offset applied to

1079
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,280
it already to convert it to utc because

1080
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,160
certainly the meaning of z as

1081
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,280
as output by these libraries uh i have

1082
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
done a conversion to

1083
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,720
what i think is utc and then i've

1084
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,240
slapped a z on the end it's not that i

1085
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,839
took the local time and slapped a z on

1086
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,000
the end

1087
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,480
all right and they're here in the local

1088
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,839
queue i have ken

1089
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,960
yeah

1090
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,640
yeah um i was going to get up and say

1091
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,560
something similar what brandon said so

1092
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,960
if i saw that string that brown proposed

1093
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
i there's a clear conflict that this

1094
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
spec needs to have text to resolve

1095
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,720
because in my eye zed still means utc

1096
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,560
and that's how i read 8601 and 3339

1097
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,520
um

1098
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,440
and especially in calendaring and i

1099
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,319
calendar and in vcard for that matter

1100
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,800
zed does mean utc it does not it does

1101
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,480
not mean we didn't know we're just going

1102
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,000
to slap it on there

1103
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,520
so i don't know how we get around this

1104
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,640
issue quite honestly

1105
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,839
uh

1106
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,040
wait i'm the next friend okay uh

1107
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,520
yeah i i don't think so

1108
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
i i think

1109
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,000
what

1110
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,359
the

1111
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,440
confusion here is

1112
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,319
is the possibility of something

1113
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,280
what we

1114
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,200
have previously called within the

1115
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,079
context of this group floating times

1116
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,640
we're not trying to

1117
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,359
do floating times here i mean

1118
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,839
these are still instants z still means

1119
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,960
udc it just doesn't assert the

1120
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,079
uh

1121
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,000
the the time zone

1122
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
which means that

1123
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,920
for

1124
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,280
a

1125
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,160
uh

1126
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,720
implementation that that looks at the

1127
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,200
offset and that looks at the

1128
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,160
time zone suffix and actually

1129
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,680
uh

1130
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,319
doesn't allow any timestamps

1131
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,880
that are that that have their quote

1132
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,800
unquote wrong offset

1133
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,400
uh for whatever reason uh would still

1134
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,599
work with z

1135
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,560
because even though the

1136
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,680
instant

1137
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,240
like z works for the instant

1138
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,640
uh it doesn't

1139
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
uh imply that the the local time

1140
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,839
was

1141
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,119
uh well

1142
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,000
gmt yeah for that instance or

1143
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
uh you know plus zero zero zero

1144
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,200
zero

1145
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,160
when i take my

1146
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,440
little bit

1147
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
i put a little bit of text in the chat

1148
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,920
maybe this is good for referencing

1149
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,720
when you speak

1150
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,079
so that's that's kind of where i was

1151
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,160
going to go um

1152
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,240
and this is kind of a question for ken i

1153
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
i

1154
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,599
when i think about these examples

1155
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,319
i'm wondering whether or not

1156
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,800
it's case of one of two things number

1157
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,680
one

1158
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,839
that this document would benefit from

1159
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,319
examples and interpretive text

1160
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,760
that explains the conclusion

1161
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,400
based on on the rules in the text or if

1162
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
you think it's just

1163
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,960
incompatible and no interpretive text

1164
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,839
will actually provide an implementer the

1165
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,359
guidance they need

1166
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,200
and i'm in a deferred account here

1167
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,760
thanks yeah i think we need examples

1168
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
with with text because in

1169
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,920
in my head when i see

1170
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,839
zed and america new york there's a clear

1171
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,319
conflict but if the spec is is written

1172
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,440
in such that

1173
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,880
the time zone

1174
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
id overrides whatever is in front of it

1175
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
then i'm fine with that but i think it

1176
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,599
needs to be spelled out and not just

1177
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,839
left for the the reader to determine on

1178
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,160
their own

1179
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,520
okay

1180
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,119
justin thanks for being patient you're

1181
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,839
next

1182
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,119
yeah yes i i i actually agree strongly

1183
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,079
that that

1184
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,680
this uh i think this discussion sort of

1185
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,599
came out from some

1186
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,880
some comments that that i made in uh uh

1187
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,119
in carson's latest pull request

1188
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,000
where i saw the example using z and i

1189
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,599
was like hey that doesn't that doesn't

1190
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,200
match the way we're using an integral so

1191
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,040
we should chat about that and so i

1192
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,200
totally agree that that a we should have

1193
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,240
examples in the spec b that there should

1194
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,440
be clear explanatory text that explains

1195
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,280
not just the the meaning we're talking

1196
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,839
about here but the the details of like

1197
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,040
is this a should or a must or may

1198
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,280
and i actually have some suggested

1199
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,680
starting point text in the pull request

1200
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,160
itself but i'd be happy to uh to work

1201
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,559
with the uh the editors to refine that

1202
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,119
going forward

1203
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,480
okay thanks bourgeois

1204
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,359
uh yeah real quick just to comment on

1205
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,960
the uh

1206
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,720
latest message by braun

1207
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,119
uh that is exactly one of the most

1208
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
common use cases that i think about

1209
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,559
when i uh think about this i think that

1210
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,720
a lot of implementations

1211
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,760
would be dealing with

1212
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,640
instance uh and and then you know

1213
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,280
separately storing in in many cases

1214
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,079
a

1215
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,400
time zone in order like

1216
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,720
to refer to the context

1217
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,599
uh

1218
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,520
and not necessarily holding them

1219
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,280
together in a single

1220
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,160
unified object so

1221
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,119
yeah in that case it would be

1222
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,119
uh

1223
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,319
good for for them to be able to take

1224
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,040
like the instant in in the

1225
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,319
utc

1226
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,559
zone and then just slap the

1227
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,119
uh time zone suffix after that

1228
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,559
uh

1229
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,440
and

1230
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,559
yeah

1231
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,720
to at the risk of

1232
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,920
uh leaking some tc39 lingo here i i

1233
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,839
think we're all in violent agreement

1234
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:08,880
here

1235
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,760
uh

1236
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,160
and i i don't think anybody's proposing

1237
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,599
the other

1238
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:14,800
uh

1239
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,280
solution

1240
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,680
okay thanks i closed the queue

1241
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,040
because i want to summarize what i've

1242
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,160
heard

1243
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,520
and make sure that i get a nod from

1244
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,200
braun that uh

1245
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,680
i'm just not just fantasizing here but i

1246
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,440
think we're very close

1247
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,760
i think uh we all uh

1248
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,440
uh essentially

1249
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
agree with carson's proposal with some

1250
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,400
additions the first edition is i

1251
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
i hear from the group

1252
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,480
that examples and interpretive texts

1253
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
that explain how the examples are to

1254
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,200
work

1255
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,440
is essential for the document

1256
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,920
uh so uh that would that would get added

1257
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,800
as well

1258
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,040
i heard from murray that i think it's

1259
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,960
important to have not a long amount of

1260
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,920
text

1261
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
but some contextual information

1262
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,160
that explains uh the deviation between

1263
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,760
3339 and what implementers went ahead

1264
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,240
and did there's nothing wrong with that

1265
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,559
um and i i think that i i think that a

1266
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
future draft should just have a

1267
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,280
paragraph or two

1268
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,119
that explains that i think that makes

1269
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,640
perfect sense and we've had several

1270
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,040
speakers in the queue that talked about

1271
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,640
that history so it doesn't seem to me

1272
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,160
that we're far away from having that

1273
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,920
and then carsten about five minutes ago

1274
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,359
noted that we do need to explicitly say

1275
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,240
what changes we're making to 3339

1276
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,400
and i think that's true as well that

1277
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
deserves highlighting in the document uh

1278
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,160
and that i i don't think uh and again

1279
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,760
uh taking my tear

1280
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,839
hat off temporarily i don't think that

1281
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,680
amounts to demolishing rfc 3339

1282
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,040
i think it

1283
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,800
means bringing it up to date after 20

1284
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,760
years

1285
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,559
um and i see my id at the chair so let

1286
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,280
me

1287
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,839
i i'm playfully curious why that word

1288
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,760
was chosen in the first place it seems

1289
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
like we're sort of spinning around can

1290
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,800
we do something that drastic

1291
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,240
i've just been reading through this

1292
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,760
again i don't think we're doing making

1293
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,599
any changes to 309 at all we're just

1294
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,359
saying if you see a zed then you don't

1295
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,280
you're not required to

1296
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
cross check um that the time zone

1297
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,839
matches up we're still giving the time

1298
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,160
zone hint separately

1299
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,760
and so it's

1300
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,200
minus zero zero is i don't know the

1301
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,480
offset

1302
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,640
plus zero zero or z is i absolutely know

1303
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,000
the offset and we're in this zone we're

1304
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,920
saying in the context of this document

1305
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,640
if you see a zed then it means

1306
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,880
this is definitely a time that's in utc

1307
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,559
but you can apply the offset that's

1308
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,839
given

1309
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,520
and and that doesn't require any changes

1310
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,160
to

1311
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,559
39 at all whether we fix that is a

1312
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,640
separate issue okay um i think your

1313
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,880
summary is great and i mean in my head

1314
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,480
i'm playing through how is the isg gonna

1315
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,839
interpret it so if it lands on them and

1316
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,359
that sounds like it'll check a lot of

1317
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,760
boxes so that's a great summary okay

1318
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,680
thanks for that uh

1319
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,800
real quick

1320
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,440
sorry am i potable oh go ahead go ahead

1321
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,200
sorry real quick uh

1322
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,280
we have time for mike

1323
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,480
uh yes uh one thing uh

1324
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,240
that justin mentioned that might be

1325
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,400
relevant is that uh

1326
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,440
this

1327
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,000
is not this distinction is not relevant

1328
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,480
in case of 3339 so

1329
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,400
we don't have to do anything there

1330
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
okay i'm going to just well i cannot

1331
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,880
agree with that uh

1332
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,520
i i used the word demolish

1333
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,559
of course that that was a joke right but

1334
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,760
um

1335
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,839
there is something that the section 4.3

1336
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,640
says and

1337
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,800
after 20 years of interoperability

1338
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,200
experience we are saying well that's not

1339
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,119
exactly what happened and we are

1340
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,520
updating that i think we have to be very

1341
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,280
very straightforward

1342
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,640
about that

1343
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,119
and on that basis we can then do all the

1344
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
other things we want to do

1345
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,119
so and i really i'm going to close the

1346
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,160
queue here justin um i apologize i am

1347
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,839
going to

1348
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,079
i think karsten my understanding of the

1349
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,079
way forward here is that if we do

1350
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,520
provide that historic context for and

1351
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,119
and

1352
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,359
the information that the working group

1353
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,720
had justin's analysis of implementations

1354
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,599
we include that that in the draft that

1355
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,599
meets both your needs and also the

1356
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,520
future needs of the iesg

1357
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,000
so i think uh i think we're in a good

1358
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,839
place to move forward i just want to

1359
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,520
check with my chair to see if he nods us

1360
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,839
out here

1361
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,559
yeah we just need to specify what we're

1362
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,079
doing

1363
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,799
i'm i'm really clear on that okay i feel

1364
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,680
like

1365
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,319
uh we have a relatively crisp

1366
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,160
definition of what is going to happen

1367
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,200
next

1368
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,520
feel good about that i won't put karsten

1369
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,680
on the spot to say when we might see the

1370
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,319
next version of the draft but he should

1371
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,079
be sort of prepared to answer that

1372
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,400
question sometime soon

1373
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
mike are you available here to give us a

1374
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,200
short update on the liaison

1375
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,160
can you hear me

1376
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,119
yeah

1377
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,720
oh good

1378
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,359
and i'll click a number of buttons uh

1379
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,280
yeah i can give a quick update doesn't

1380
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
it it shouldn't take the

1381
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,760
few minutes we have left

1382
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,160
let me see here let me uh

1383
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,240
bring up your slides here and i'll

1384
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,000
share them you can tell me when to move

1385
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,880
forward

1386
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,240
great if yeah if you could drive them

1387
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,960
for me that would be helpful um

1388
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,119
so yeah the the approval took

1389
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,480
ages actually didn't it um from and i

1390
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,319
did notice when i was looking back to

1391
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,079
see exactly when it was actually april

1392
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,799
1st they approved it so that was

1393
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,000
uh very

1394
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,200
very good

1395
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,640
um so i haven't uh really had much uh

1396
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,400
dealings with the actual with actual

1397
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,880
tc154 but they have had um

1398
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,319
yeah you can move on to the next slide i

1399
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,640
think they've had five meetings since i

1400
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,079
um

1401
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,240
since it was approved but not all of

1402
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,280
them are to do with um

1403
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,559
the 8601 work um

1404
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,720
they're also working on thirty four

1405
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
thousand which is uh the cabin that

1406
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,040
should be vocabulary and uh

1407
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,200
and terms so a couple of the meetings

1408
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,839
were more related to that than

1409
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,799
than the 8601 work um and by the time i

1410
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,280
got involved with with this i think a

1411
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,520
lot of the work

1412
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,240
um that they intended doing has been

1413
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
sort of done

1414
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
but they did raise a

1415
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,559
a topic i think i mentioned in the next

1416
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,559
slide

1417
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,680
uh yeah this

1418
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
this turned up this actually got

1419
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,440
inserted into thing

1420
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,200
on the first or second meeting i

1421
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,599
attended where apparently there's some

1422
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,720
legal

1423
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,400
requirement in germany

1424
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,319
when you talk about contracts and

1425
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,599
deadlines

1426
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,839
they they talk about

1427
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:13,359
2400 as being the deadline for something

1428
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,160
that added a whole load of complications

1429
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,420
to

1430
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,839
[Music]

1431
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,559
um

1432
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,520
8601 it um

1433
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,280
in every other case there's no end of a

1434
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,880
period you talk about the start of the

1435
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,720
next period effectively the end date is

1436
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,640
really the start of the of the next

1437
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,040
period and it's non-inclusive

1438
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,359
and that works very nicely this is this

1439
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,119
is an outlier

1440
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,480
um

1441
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,559
reading back i have a feeling this is

1442
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,319
actually in

1443
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,280
some of the earlier 8601 specs

1444
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,599
i don't know how matters because

1445
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,319
much of what we're doing the itf is is a

1446
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,880
profile of things and we don't we don't

1447
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,040
need to go down this hole but it's

1448
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,799
something probably to look for it's

1449
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,119
anything i noticed as being of um

1450
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,839
particular interest

1451
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:04,720
um

1452
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,839
was there another

1453
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,280
slide oh yeah i

1454
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,920
i wanted to try and get hold of the

1455
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,319
actual document we're working on i i've

1456
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:18,000
been attending the meetings and um

1457
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,799
and

1458
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,319
going through them with people but the

1459
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,079
documents were presented on the screen

1460
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,760
and it hadn't occurred to me

1461
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
that when i tried to get an actual copy

1462
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,079
of the working document it would be as

1463
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,920
difficult as it is

1464
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,079
iso does not like sharing its documents

1465
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
because they want you to pay for them

1466
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,040
i'm still trying to get a um

1467
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,680
a working copy i can present to this

1468
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,720
group

1469
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
and see if i can actually present to

1470
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,880
this group if i do get one because they

1471
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,640
are very unwilling to share their stuff

1472
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,480
so that's that's still an open issue

1473
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
and i think that's where i am at the

1474
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,400
moment

1475
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,000
okay

1476
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,480
i'm gonna let bryan take the mic yeah i

1477
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,720
had one thing here that i wanted to ask

1478
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,880
mike the main thing that we need from a

1479
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,960
leo's on as this working group is a

1480
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,760
commitment from iso uh not to clash with

1481
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,839
whatever syntax we do in a way that's

1482
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,720
that's going to be unpassable

1483
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,440
do you

1484
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,359
know what the status on that is and what

1485
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,240
we can do to advance it

1486
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,400
i can what i think i can

1487
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,920
that was why i wanted to get hold of a

1488
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,839
copy of the of the actual working

1489
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,760
document to see what the

1490
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,799
the um

1491
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,400
the effect of these changes they're

1492
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,240
making are but they're mostly seen to be

1493
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,799
fixing up errors and things in the in

1494
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,000
the general

1495
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,200
um

1496
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,960
that have turned up in the document

1497
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,520
since it was last um published

1498
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,640
so i

1499
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,680
might

1500
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
feel as there won't be anything of that

1501
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,880
kind but it's hard to be certain without

1502
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,079
a um

1503
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,359
actual document to look at

1504
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,880
so let me insert myself in the queue

1505
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,400
here although our time has come to an

1506
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,520
end um mike let me tell you that the iab

1507
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
is well aware that this problem exists

1508
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,720
this is not just for you your liaison

1509
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,040
role but for many liaison roles and so

1510
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,520
what i'll reach i'll do is reach out to

1511
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,640
the iab's liaison coordinator

1512
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,400
to see if we can solve this problem for

1513
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,960
you and i'll take that as a to-do

1514
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,280
okay i was going to contact i had a

1515
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,000
contact that ron suggested i try which i

1516
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,520
was going to send her a message and see

1517
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,359
if i could get hold of a copy of the

1518
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,680
document but

1519
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,559
none has been published in the um iso

1520
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,280
document repository for for me to look

1521
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,720
at

1522
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,359
right right and i think i i would

1523
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,799
encourage you to go ahead and do that

1524
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,720
but i will also work through the iab

1525
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,119
channel and try to get yeah

1526
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,079
it does make it a little difficult to

1527
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,920
see what's going on

1528
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,040
okay

1529
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,000
thanks for the update mike that's great

1530
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,440
and if you have if you have anything you

1531
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,079
wanted to me to take back to them

1532
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,520
related today

1533
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,000
um if i can have a statement and i can

1534
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,920
pass it back but i'm not sure that we're

1535
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,720
at that stage yet

1536
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,119
okay

1537
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,960
okay

1538
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,400
thanks again mike thank you uh

1539
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,359
that is the end of our time

1540
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,000
i think um anything further that we do

1541
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,880
we should pursue on the mailing list

1542
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,040
and so thank you to all the participants

1543
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,280
both remote and in person

1544
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,799
and i hope you have a good rest of the

1545
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,920
week here at the ietf

1546
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,839
awesome thanks everybody

1547
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,559
good

1548
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,839
very quick

1549
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,079
yep

1550
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,200
well we've got uh

1551
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,920
are we there yet yes

1552
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,640
i think we are there yet we do like what

1553
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,720
we really want is just for iso to say we

1554
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,480
will not use left square bracket in our

1555
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,880
format that's what we did

1556
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,240
so that whatever we stick at the end

1557
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,720
is never going to synthetically clash

1558
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,919
you can reliably pass it

1559
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,960
wait are we still audible

1560
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,680
yes you are go ahead

1561
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,599
okay are we allowed to make small talk

1562
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,319
uh no i mean uh yeah

1563
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,520
uh

1564
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,160
i i was overhearing you sorry abroad for

1565
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,520
that but yeah

1566
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,599
yeah i do feel that

1567
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,079
with this we have

1568
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:28,960
uh

1569
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,760
at least semantic consensus what i would

1570
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,880
say is

1571
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,799
we have

1572
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,559
a a clear understanding of what each

1573
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,079
part of the proposal should do and

1574
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,760
there's some editorial work left

1575
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,319
which we could

1576
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,440
take care of uh without needing

1577
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,319
uh

1578
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,599
to to collect everyone in the same room

1579
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,000
uh that said i i suppose

1580
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,799
it would be nice if people started

1581
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,359
doing more reviews

1582
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,760
now uh yeah

1583
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,160
yeah real reviews sound sense

1584
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,920
that sounds reasonable

1585
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,440
um

1586
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,799
yeah i guess we'll discuss this on the

1587
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,240
mailing list is obviously the next step

1588
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,599
given that most of the people have

1589
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,440
walked out of the room already um and

1590
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,520
probably two people popped offline we're

1591
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,359
down to eight

1592
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,240
seven

1593
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,200
something like that um but yeah it's

1594
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,960
it does feel like we're basically there

1595
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,440
we just need iso to sign off on we can

1596
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,599
use those characters in our syntax and

1597
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,640
we need

1598
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,960
to agree that if there's a z there then

1599
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,319
it doesn't need to align with the time

1600
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,400
zone that doesn't mean you can only use

1601
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,760
utc

1602
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,839
and i think we've basically done apart

1603
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,680
from that

1604
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,200
nice uh

1605
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,079
yeah on our end we have been

1606
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,440
uh

1607
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,599
good citizens by not

1608
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,799
uh

1609
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,000
putting this

1610
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,960
in in any browser yet like

1611
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,640
all the implementations are behind the

1612
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,400
flag

1613
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,359
so

1614
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,760
yeah i hope this gets done soon and we

1615
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,280
can unflag

1616
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,599
this beautiful api

1617
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,000
cool all right so we will we'll move as

1618
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,720
fast as we can and i guess

1619
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,480
try and schedule an interim

1620
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,359
soonish if we think we need it if we

1621
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,079
think we need that to push it forward

1622
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,920
yeah otherwise if people are happy to do

1623
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,599
it asynchronously then we can finish

1624
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,079
this on email pretty quick

1625
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,400
yeah uh i i i think

1626
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,200
uh

1627
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,280
from talking to carsten i i think we

1628
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,200
should be able to done

1629
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,400
we should be

1630
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,799
done with the editorial stuff in

1631
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,880
within a couple of weeks so maybe

1632
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,599
after that would be a good time

1633
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,440
cool i don't know if mike's still online

1634
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,119
or not but yeah the one thing is if we

1635
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,559
can get iso to

1636
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,799
to say this is all right like that's

1637
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,400
what that's the thing that we really the

1638
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,280
reason we got this liaison is to go to

1639
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,520
iso and say can you give us a statement

1640
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,000
that this is okay

1641
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,200
right so

1642
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,599
yeah i guess for that we need to finish

1643
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,520
up the draft on our end right so that

1644
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,359
they could take a look in and

1645
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,920
tell us what they think about it uh but

1646
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,480
yeah i feel weakly positive about this

1647
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,200
so certainly the syntax is going to be

1648
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,880
the big issue there semantics too but

1649
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,640
the syntax is the bit that

1650
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,920
you have to be able to pass to tell if

1651
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,400
it's one of these things or not

1652
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,440
yeah that's that's fair uh

1653
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,599
yeah i i guess once we

1654
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,520
were done with some of the bigger at

1655
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,000
least editorial changes we could

1656
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,760
uh ping mike up and and ask

1657
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,559
them to present it at the next

1658
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,079
uh meeting

1659
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,200
yeah off

1660
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,880
yeah

1661
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,559
cool all right

1662
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,839
thank you

1663
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,720
justin did you have anything well yeah

1664
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,559
i was just saying once first of all

1665
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,880
thanks so much for your all all your

1666
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,359
guys help uh uh and braun for your

1667
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,160
opinions it's it's been great um

1668
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,799
i think uh uh now that we seems like we

1669
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,359
have tentative consensus on the overall

1670
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,839
idea i think the biggest outstanding one

1671
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,520
will be like well what's uh what's a

1672
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,839
must what's a should and what's a may

1673
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,880
for for the various options and that i i

1674
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,319
have some suggested spec text in the

1675
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,200
uh in the pull request that uh that i

1676
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,640
can follow up with but if you want to

1677
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,039
take a look at that and you know

1678
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,400
add your opinion to that that would be

1679
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,599
helpful too

1680
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,720
all right i'll have a read through

1681
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,799
