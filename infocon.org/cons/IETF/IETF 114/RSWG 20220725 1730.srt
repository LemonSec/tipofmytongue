4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,399

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
as a month

14
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400

15
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440

24
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
felt bad because he also had a cough so

25
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,480
he shouldn't be yelling

26
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,509
[Music]

um

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
welcome to rswg um if you're not

38
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
especially rswg go

39
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
go somewhere else

40
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
um

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
i guess come in the next slide

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
do i do that

43
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
i do that yeah okay great

44
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
i knew there was a

45
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
oh purpose so yes so there's some

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
confusion about exactly what noel should

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
be shown um which we'll cover later in

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
this meeting for the purposes of this

49
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
discussion um please be aware of the

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
note well here's slide one um and you

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
can mentally substitute rswg for ietf in

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
some but not all of these sentences

53
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
so in particular you're still consenting

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
to the ietf i'm making a photographic

55
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,639
record apparently as opposed to the rswg

56
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
so please be familiar with this

57
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,639
and your next slide

58
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
you know have some rfcs um which again

59
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
may or may not apply um

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
so assuming you understand these races

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
i've explained them to you um we'll move

62
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
on

63
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,360
um

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
so we had like a relatively short agenda

65
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,759
um you know this got formed um so mostly

66
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,039
we're hoping to just sort out some

67
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,160
ground rules

68
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
um so we want to talk about four things

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,919
um

70
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
um sort of get a sense of what people

71
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
think um you know the scope and and

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
of the work and acceptance criteria are

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
and i know elliot had posted some

74
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
thoughts outside of his house's criteria

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
um let's talk about some logistics with

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
everybody's favorite topic being github

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
um

78
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
a um

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
cover basically then we had a set of

80
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
proposals for like um you know things

81
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,880
you might look at and just like make

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
sure everybody's aware of them and see

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
if anyone anyone strikes anybody's fancy

84
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
and really want people to want to work

85
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,639
on it

86
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,840
and then i guess all their business in

87
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,719
case there is a business

88
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
thank you does anybody object to this

89
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
agenda as i've explained it

90
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
no okay

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
so just to remind you this is our

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
charter um this is in fact pretty much

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,039
the only description of what our scope

94
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,080
is

95
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
um but the key word here is policy

96
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
um and i guess members of the community

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
and collaborate so this is just like

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
background for um you know what it is um

99
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
we're supposed to be discussing

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
um next slide

101
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
i'm sorry with that oh yeah sorry yes um

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
so here is the description of the

103
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,919
workflow for what we're supposed to be

104
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,880
doing

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
um which looks which will look very

106
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
familiar to you and that it will look

107
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,759
very much like an ietf working group

108
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,840
where people produce proposals we accept

109
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,199
adopt them and then eventually you know

110
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,479
we refine them and we ship them out is

111
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,599
there a second slide with us or this is

112
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
the first

113
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,280
no okay

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
right so with that in mind i think um

115
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
you know this is our the chairs put

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
about like what how to sort of drive

117
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
this um again so if someone poses some

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
new work our theory is it better be

119
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
about policy number one

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
um the radius of enthusiasm over the

121
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,479
topic because otherwise we're not

122
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,840
getting anything done

123
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
we think we have some kind of consensus

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
in the solution um even if there's not

125
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
consensus on the proposal itself

126
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,240
and finally that we have a proposal that

127
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
seems like a plausible starting point

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
and again this is just like me like

129
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
mirroring all the crap that we all

130
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
normally do in a nighttime group

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
um and of course these are all decided

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
usually by rougher people consensus so i

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,199
know there's some discussion on the list

134
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,560
does anybody think that this is like a

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
bad place to start or

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
oh robert thank you i can't see

137
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
hi hecker i just wanted to ask you to

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
stay closer to the microphone um

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
you're

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
fading out for the remote people okay

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
well about as close as i can be without

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
like

143
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,479
actually

144
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
ah i see all right

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
how about that

146
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
great

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,039
so

148
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,720
this is not intended to be like holy

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
writ but does anybody think this is like

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
radically wrong or wants to prove some

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
revisions or some other criteria that i

152
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,479
missed or something like that

153
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
comments

154
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
here yeah

155
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,400
i don't think this is wrong but it's

156
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
like it's still very blurry i'm not sure

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
how helpful this is but we will see

158
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,519
okay what we're expecting is to sit and

159
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
wait for proposals to come in

160
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
yeah but i'm just saying like all of

161
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
these points it's like when proposal

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,599
comes and we actually don't know for

163
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,120
sure it's about policy right we have to

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
have the discussion

165
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
and we don't know at the beginning like

166
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
if we reach consensus or whatever so

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
like these are good goals but not sure

168
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,839
how much much that helps

169
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,680
okay uh elijah so so one thing that came

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,240
up earlier today in with the rsap is

171
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
that there's also this um

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
issues that might arise from the rpc

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
that they bring to the rsap and the rsep

174
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
decides policy work needs to happen and

175
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
they should then be brought here

176
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
so even when there's no enthusiasm you

177
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
got to do something occasionally

178
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,519
because the rpc depends on it but

179
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,880
otherwise this is this is good

180
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
i'm i guess i'm going to make lars this

181
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
point in a different way which is there

182
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
are some things that are

183
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
sort of like it's more expert review

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
than policy

185
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
and yeah and i think we

186
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
it's probably worth explicitly saying

187
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,440
that that not everything is in scope

188
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,959
here and there's some stuff that needs

189
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,240
to be pushed down to a level so that

190
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
people can keep to keep the documents

191
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
flowing

192
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
yeah that is that was it that was this

193
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,519
is trying to capture that but may have

194
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,279
failed to do so so i'm not posing to

195
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,560
like write a draft here but this like

196
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
this is just the like we just want to

197
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
make sure people didn't think some

198
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
radical other structure was needed

199
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
okay

200
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,160
oh nothingham

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
all right now wait is that work okay

202
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
sorry it always makes me click like five

203
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,640
different buttons

204
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,519
um

205
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
i kind of wonder

206
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
it seems to me we might be able to take

207
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,959
some of the heat out of the policy

208
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
versus not policy issue

209
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,640
if there were a mechanism to say okay

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
that's something that you know we've

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
brought to the community's attention

212
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
it's not policy but it can go to you

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
know the rpc in a discussion in a

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
relatively transparent way

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
and and what i'm thinking about is i

216
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
think it was it was mentioned earlier on

217
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
uh about having an issues list for the

218
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
working group and you know so if if

219
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,920
i i feel like there are some things

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
which are are you know

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
maybe surfing below or just around the

222
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
level of whether what is or is not

223
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
policy rather than kind of face planting

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
the working group into having a big

225
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,200
argument about what is and is not policy

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
if if we have an issue we say okay

227
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,959
that's something that we would like to

228
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,760
improve or that you know it's not really

229
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
you know pure policy but at least we get

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
it out in front of the community the rpc

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
can hit it off and it's not something

232
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
that you know somebody says oh no you

233
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
should just go talk to the rpc directly

234
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
i think that might take a little bit of

235
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
the heat out of this kind of

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,399
zone if that makes sense uh just

237
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,600
something to to think about

238
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
thank you

239
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
paul

240
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,959
paul hoffman so

241
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
many working group mailing lists are for

242
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
working group work plus

243
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
other stuff that's not working group and

244
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,959
stuff like that and that can get really

245
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,440
messy but also it's really terrible to

246
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
say no you can't talk about that here

247
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
and there's nothing else so i'm not

248
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
proposing a solution but some of the

249
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
stuff that people said before about

250
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
there might be an rpc thing that comes

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,040
in and such like that that could be not

252
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
working group work that's on the mailing

253
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
list that just needs to be looked at and

254
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
said

255
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
okay we know that that's not policy we

256
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
know that's not happening and treat it

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
like a normal working group mailing list

258
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
where other stuff might or might not

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,320
happen um having said that that's a

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,839
really attractive nuisance about

261
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
everything in the in the rfc editor

262
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,639
series so i'm not saying that's a good

263
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
idea so so let me show you the next

264
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
slide and um

265
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
we sort of anticipated

266
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
that

267
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
we're going to end up with some sort of

268
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
issue tracker so this is logistics but i

269
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
think it goes to your point

270
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
that they're going to be

271
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,880
sort of issues looking for a draft

272
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
looking for people to pick up and

273
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
champion the idea

274
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
um

275
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,360
and

276
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,839
gather together some thought that yes

277
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,760
this belongs here and we want to write

278
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
this up and we want to get the working

279
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
group to work on it

280
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
and then independently we're going to

281
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
have once someone proposes a draft and

282
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,040
adopts it which is really the main

283
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
portion of the workflow as stated in

284
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
9280 then we're gonna have a draft to

285
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
work with and we'll have issues on that

286
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,000
draft as the working group goes through

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
it and works on it so i think

288
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,800
yeah we're gonna have those issues where

289
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
people are well we should think about

290
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
what this is and whether this belongs

291
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
here and that discussion can go on and

292
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,839
sort of have that as a parallel track to

293
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,120
oh and here's the work that we're

294
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
actually trying to get done and write a

295
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
new policy for does that

296
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,800
sort of go to what you were looking at

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
paul nods is that up and down

298
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
miriam yeah mia could have been again i

299
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
just want to remind this group that

300
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
there's still the rfc interest mailing

301
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
list and that will stick around so it's

302
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
like there's it's not like there's no

303
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,518
other place to go

304
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
good

305
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
so um

306
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
with regard to logistics like i said we

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
we've already seen a number of issues

308
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
both in the form of drafts but more

309
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
mostly in the form of hey here's

310
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
something i think this group might work

311
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,399
on

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
so

313
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
we've been talking about it

314
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
we're thinking that we can simply use

315
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
github as the issue tracker but we are

316
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
not led to that

317
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
either way discussion of any of the

318
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,920
items takes place on the mailing list

319
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
um but we will need some sort of

320
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
tracking device if people have strong

321
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
feelings about it one way or the other

322
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,040
uh please do mention but otherwise we're

323
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
you know just going to figure out what

324
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
feels comfortable and go ahead and do

325
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
that

326
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
like i said it'll end up on the mailing

327
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
list one way or the other

328
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
um

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
so

330
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
if there's no comments on that we've got

331
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,440
the list of things that people have

332
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
brought up on the mailing list

333
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
and if people want to just give a quick

334
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
this is what i'm thinking about this is

335
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
what i think needs to be done and you

336
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,120
are present in the room

337
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,160
uh except robert jumps in and and has a

338
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,279
comment robert go ahead

339
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
no i just have a uh topic that i wanted

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
to call out so put me at the end of the

341
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,240
queue after the people that are already

342
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
on the side have had an opportunity

343
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
sounds good

344
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,079
um

345
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,959
so

346
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
uh this is

347
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
do we have a second

348
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
yeah we have two slides of this

349
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
um so i'll just call off issues and if

350
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,399
people want to come up and say something

351
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
about them please do um

352
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
paul did you want to talk about

353
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,399
the the

354
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,000
documenting the relationship stuff just

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
super briefly because it should be on

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
the mailing list and right as we could

357
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
see people it's complicated i wanted to

358
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,760
see if there was interest it seems like

359
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
there's interest there may be interest

360
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,079
in doing it a very a different way we

361
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,000
already have a worked out example from

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
earlier um but i didn't know if people

363
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
had burnt out on it and didn't want to

364
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
deal with it or want to deal with it and

365
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
i got the feeling people want to deal

366
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
with it and then we'll have to figure

367
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,320
out splitting things out and such like

368
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,519
that but

369
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
yeah and and i mean going back to the

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
logistics issue and you know ecker and i

371
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
haven't talked about this particularly

372
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
but my sense is

373
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
you know for

374
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
we don't have a draft yet we're trying

375
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
to figure it out ecker and i are here to

376
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
moderate that discussion and and sort of

377
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
move it along but it doesn't become a

378
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,639
working group item until there there's

379
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
an agreed pair of or you know three or

380
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,759
ten authors who say yeah we're going to

381
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,079
work on this document put the draft out

382
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,480
there and say we want this adopted

383
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
so we'll we'll manage those discussions

384
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,360
but you know and so this discussion we

385
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,440
can continue on the list until you all

386
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
decide yep we want a draft and we want

387
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
to get this adopted

388
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,880
um

389
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
is brian in the room i didn't see him

390
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
no brian's not around does anyone want

391
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
to comment on

392
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
brian's proposal with regard to updating

393
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
and versioning

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,199
um

395
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
so i mean this was basically the

396
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
perennial question of like referential

397
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,800
integrity for you know when you talk

398
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,839
about sip or rfcs and you get abyss like

399
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,279
how does that work and how do you know

400
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,120
do you have standard numbers or or

401
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,519
numbers or whatever so um that's what

402
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
this that's what this topic was about um

403
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,160
so i don't know if people have

404
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,399
enthusiasm for is there's an enthusiasm

405
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,079
for that uh but that's what this topic

406
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,040
was

407
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
um and i can just go i mean i i i put

408
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
these in so i can go through these um

409
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,400
um

410
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,799
this next topic um and so i think our

411
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,079
plan is basically to take each one of

412
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,280
these and make an issue about it and

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,520
then and and and then i think you know

414
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,679
allow you know allow you know i'll

415
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,720
probably just cut and paste out of the

416
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,000
emails that introduce them so that we'll

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,799
have a

418
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
description and then you know paul if i

419
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,760
don't do it properly you can feel free

420
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,919
to like out of the issue whatever um so

421
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,359
this next topic in fact was something

422
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
what miriam was just talking about which

423
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,559
is and pete were what's going on the

424
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,280
rswg list versus the rfc interest list

425
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
um

426
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,559
then these next two are there apparently

427
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,559
a number of rfcs that are either in an

428
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,440
unknown

429
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
unknown status or in a legacy stream and

430
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
are we going to attempt to repair that

431
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,799
and if so how

432
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,039
um

433
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,600
uh this next topic is apparently the ieb

434
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,280
stream is not chartered with his bcps

435
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
and it has done so

436
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,799
and so we have to manage that somehow so

437
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,480
these three are all like we created a

438
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
mess in the past and do we care

439
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
um

440
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
next slide

441
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,840
uh right can rfcs be on more than one

442
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
stream

443
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,960
um

444
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,559
um i'm not sure it's natural it's policy

445
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,679
but what should be the rc email

446
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
announcement

447
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
um

448
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
the um you know there's a lot of

449
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
questions the boilerplate whatever um

450
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
this author ethics point um i know this

451
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
came up in the ietf list um was you know

452
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,320
what is your responsibility as an as an

453
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
rfc author and a draft author if you're

454
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,440
taking what someone else has done but

455
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
you're not you're not making them an

456
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
author in your document in terms of

457
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
acknowledgement or whatever um i think

458
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
you know especially in cases where

459
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
you're essentially just taking someone

460
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,960
else's document wholesale which is

461
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
permitted by the copyright but maybe not

462
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
by maybe not by better practice

463
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,559
um

464
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,400
a topic that came with this morning um

465
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
format evolution um i think you know um

466
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
the more i look at 90 280 the more i see

467
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
it as a framework for creating

468
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,039
self-governance rather than a framework

469
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
for self-governance and so you know we

470
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,080
didn't actually write down who's

471
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,120
responsible for actually doing the

472
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
pieces of format evolution um and so

473
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
we'll if we want to have the format

474
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
evolve um it seems to me probably like

475
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
looking at it personally it seems to me

476
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
nobody's actually empowered to involve

477
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
the format right now and so they're

478
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,679
working um

479
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,080
paul you may want to disagree so um

480
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
um

481
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,960
often um i read 9280s that is absolutely

482
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
part of part of of this working group um

483
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
that is it is policy

484
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
what what is an rfc is policy and since

485
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you know the the format is

486
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
you know how does the rfc exist as bits

487
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
on on disk much less on the wire

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
i totally thought it was that if

489
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,039
i purposely wasn't involved in the

490
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,559
creation of 9280 if it wasn't there

491
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
that seems like a massive oversight

492
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
because that's one of the pieces of work

493
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,400
that's been ongoing for years i guess my

494
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
sense is that there was going to be some

495
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
arguing about exactly what was policy

496
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,840
was mechanism in terms of like so this

497
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
worker you'd be deciding like what the

498
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
names of the tags are but um i think

499
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
we're certainly empowered to direct my

500
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
senses we're empowered to direct that

501
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
work but exactly how we divide up that

502
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
work is perhaps the question that needs

503
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
to be designed michael i think

504
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,919
robert robert

505
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
yeah so

506
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,400
um

507
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
i will

508
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
enter into that conversation i think

509
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
that this working group is the place

510
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
that we have to do the evolution of of

511
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,480
at least the grammar and

512
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
probably is the group that's going to be

513
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
the touchstone on dealing with some of

514
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
the technical issues like if we decide

515
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
to make radical changes to the way rfcs

516
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
are presented um like changing out the

517
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,159
css entirely for the way the

518
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,960
um

519
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,679
rscs are presented um on the rfc

520
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,240
editor's website for example

521
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
um i really do think that

522
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
we need to have a a a venue that is

523
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
consensus based and i was expecting this

524
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
group to be that group

525
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
so that i can get out of the queue i

526
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,679
will

527
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,200
bring my other

528
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
existing topic up you can add it to the

529
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
slide if you want or just put in the

530
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
issue tracker later

531
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
i would like to see this group take on

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
um

533
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,559
changing the policy

534
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,280
for um internet graphs and the rscs to

535
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,559
allow utf-8 throughout the document and

536
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
not just in names

537
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
elliot

538
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
hey uh good afternoon everyone and good

539
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,039
evening to those in europe and i guess

540
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,400
i think it's good morning though to

541
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,039
those who are down under in

542
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
in australia and new zealand

543
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,000
um

544
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
i want to just comment about

545
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
um

546
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,400
the format evolution we were i think in

547
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,280
in intentionally vague in creating in

548
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
stating things

549
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
um in terms of what exactly

550
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,039
the rswg

551
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
uh wants to pass judgment on and i say

552
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
wants to

553
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,080
because i think at the end of the day

554
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
the rswg

555
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
can pass judgment on whatever it wants

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
to pass judgment it can draw the line of

557
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
policy wherever it wants to

558
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
but with the understanding that

559
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
we can we as the rswg can break things

560
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,360
very badly for

561
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,280
uh everybody if we if if we get it wrong

562
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,640
so um we should just choose wisely but

563
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
it's also one of the reasons we should

564
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
walk and not run

565
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,720
in this process and try and just step

566
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
through you know learn as we go we don't

567
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
have a lot of running code which is say

568
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
we have none

569
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
in the in terms of

570
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
you know how these groups operate

571
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
you know you saw the sort of fumbling

572
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,679
that we did in the rsab today

573
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
we're going to do more of that as we get

574
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
through this process and we'll just have

575
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
some patience to try and figure out how

576
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,280
to draw the line in each case

577
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,080
all right thanks

578
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,080
mike

579
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,559
mike st johns i want to go back to what

580
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,400
ecker said a little bit earlier about

581
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,360
how

582
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,159
the document is more of a framework

583
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,240
is is a framework not really a finished

584
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
thing for what this group is going to be

585
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,120
doing

586
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
um

587
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
the charter isn't a charter it's sort of

588
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,159
a statement of interest and it may be

589
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,000
worthwhile to spend

590
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,039
maybe the first month or so

591
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,720
trying to

592
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
say what we're going to start with and

593
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
just sort of get a basket around that

594
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
otherwise we're going to be piecemealing

595
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,919
ourselves out into a lot of space and we

596
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,360
won't make progress on anything

597
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,960
going back to what elliott was talking

598
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,480
about i wasn't saying anything but

599
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,840
the rsab is the final decider on whether

600
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,000
or not it's policy or not

601
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,159
i mean you can say its policy here but

602
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,000
if they disagree

603
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
it's not gonna it's not gonna move

604
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
forward so

605
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
having a discussion with the rsab at

606
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,559
some point on the way to get a line

607
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,000
or sort of a

608
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
fuzzy line might be a useful thing as

609
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
well

610
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
thank

611
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,799
you all right he's back

612
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
thanks um

613
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
eric and uh thanks mike uh now i'll

614
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,960
comment sort of with the you know my rsb

615
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
member hat

616
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
i don't think that policy was a criteria

617
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
for making a decision if if it doesn't

618
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
break the stream and i don't

619
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,720
perceive it as if i if i don't perceive

620
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
it breaking the stream or breaking the

621
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
long-term interests of the series

622
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,720
that's sort of the the the measure i

623
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
think those are the measures that 9280

624
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
states and those are the measures by

625
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
which i will

626
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
judge something in the you know as the

627
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
art with my rsap hat on just

628
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
that's my own

629
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
personal view

630
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,200
um in terms of how to interpret 9280 and

631
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
i just want you guys to know going

632
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,720
forward that's that's how i'll look at

633
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,799
it

634
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,279
sorry me again um

635
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
ellie i i understand where earlier it's

636
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
coming from but at some point in time

637
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
you have to keep this group from

638
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
basically

639
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,720
micromanaging the people who are doing

640
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
the publication and pieces of that and

641
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,640
that's why i'm saying that there ought

642
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,520
to be

643
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,360
some discussion about where that line is

644
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
drawn because otherwise we're going to

645
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,039
get into trouble really quickly

646
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
so mike i tend to agree with you but i

647
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,760
also don't think we have to be too um

648
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
theoretical about it that to a certain

649
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
extent as the discussion develops in the

650
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
group about a particular proposal

651
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
i think we will

652
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,039
be able to say hey this is or isn't a

653
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,840
policy question for these reasons and

654
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
then develop

655
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
what we think the principle underlying

656
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
that is as we go so i don't think we

657
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
have to spend a whole lot of upfront

658
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,159
time sort of imagining what is and isn't

659
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,880
policy we can take on issues and develop

660
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,840
that policy as we're

661
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,919
working i just want to add that um

662
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,679
that 9280 contemplates and in fact

663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,120
expects that the rcb members will

664
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,799
participate in the discussion and so i

665
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,000
would hope that as we have these kinds

666
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
of individual things that they would in

667
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,840
fact say you know well we think this is

668
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
your micromanaging now and like my rsv

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
hat like i might be sad about that

670
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,720
or vice versa

671
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080

672
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
paul hoffman so one thing that's not on

673
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,960
this list that has come up in my mind a

674
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,159
few times

675
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,120
is

676
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,320
as we are doing policy for our seas

677
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
that kind of slumps into policy for

678
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
internet drafts

679
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
it certainly co we could limit it to the

680
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
last internet draft or or the internet

681
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
draft that gets sent to the rfc editor

682
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,080
must blot a blah but then everyone knows

683
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
that there should be ones before i don't

684
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,480
have an answer for that i know that's

685
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,640
not in our charter

686
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
but

687
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,679
a bunch of the stuff we've talked about

688
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,400
will probably slump back into the

689
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
internet draft series whether we are

690
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,440
being

691
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
on it or not don't know how to do that

692
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,440
but i think we should be aware because

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
there are many people who would say

694
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,360
internet drafts can do anything

695
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
don't limit us there

696
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,799
largest behind you strongly agree

697
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,320
hey last i got now i have two things to

698
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
say so one i disagree because it's the

699
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,440
isg who was in charge of the internet

700
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
draft in the format right and so and so

701
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,640
uh

702
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
there'll be blood i guess if this group

703
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
wants to go into that space um but that

704
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,640
said right um our inner drafts are

705
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,559
produced using the same tools as rfcs

706
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,919
and therefore there's a natural bleed

707
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,279
over but which is what you said right so

708
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,120
we gotta sort of have some communication

709
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
and and we want that but

710
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
um policy for internet drives is set by

711
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
the isg the the thing i actually got in

712
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,880
the line for something else and

713
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,720
um we've been talking about you know

714
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,159
this group does policy but it's actually

715
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
doing policy for the series

716
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
right and specifically in my mind that

717
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
means this is about the the what do you

718
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,640
want

719
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,159
from the series

720
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,720
not the how do you get to the thing

721
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
right which would be the production

722
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
center's responsibility and and other

723
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
groups the streams maybe

724
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
and maybe thinking about it this way

725
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,159
sort of

726
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,559
eliminates some things or rules them in

727
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
our other scope

728
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,520
i mean that's how i've been thinking

729
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,279
about it surfaces i mean i was thinking

730
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,640
like one might say you know we want the

731
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,240
rfcs to render in two columns and we'd

732
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
let like robert figure out how to do it

733
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
like css did it but we wouldn't be like

734
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
you know here it's like you know here's

735
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,720
here's here's where to use css grid or

736
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
masonry or you know

737
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,360
or or flexbox

738
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,360
gene

739
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,919
hi there

740
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
gene mahoney and um i am

741
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
putting on my rpc hat and saying hey um

742
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
i will be participating in

743
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
this working group and providing the rpc

744
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,760
perspective

745
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,039
on these questions

746
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,719
welcome

747
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,039
okay well that was good

748
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
um probably got that one done um the

749
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,320
other two items that exist are um

750
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
concern about errata trolls um this is

751
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
brian again um are we seeing a bunch of

752
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
errata that's sort of messed up um and

753
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
should there be any more gateways on

754
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,279
onorata to make it more difficult to

755
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,360
post them um i'm not taking a position

756
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,679
on this i'm i'm merely um i'm merely

757
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,159
noting this is an item that came up um

758
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,840
and the final item is the one i raised

759
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,919
earlier which is um

760
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,279
like what if anything we didn't need to

761
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,440
do the wall text to make and and maybe

762
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
associate rfc is to make it properly

763
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,600
match the practices we have here so um

764
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,039
when i looked at the noble text earlier

765
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,240
i noticed that basically it seemed to

766
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
have three broad chunks

767
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,919
um one the anti-harassment policy which

768
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
we all agreed in 92 80 is that we're

769
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
going to adopt the itf and investment

770
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,799
policy so it's merely a matter of doing

771
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,399
whatever screwing around with an oel to

772
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,880
make it properly point that out um

773
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
the um

774
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,919
then there's the uh

775
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,720
um

776
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
ipr sections

777
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
um

778
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000
which

779
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,840
it's actually um 9280 sort of an

780
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,640
admission it's not actually saying

781
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
anything about whatsoever um and that

782
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
may be sort of unfortunate um but

783
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
presumably we have to since we take

784
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
since we're taking the um so we're

785
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,600
taking things into our drafts then we're

786
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,080
presumably expecting the boilerplate um

787
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,799
but it's worth noting that uh um it's

788
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,640
not clear we incorporated the patents by

789
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
the patent on thing by reference um so

790
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,320
that'd be nice to work out and then

791
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,440
finally there's sort of the material

792
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
about like you know where you're

793
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,159
consenting to being photographed when

794
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,440
you go to the meeting and when you're

795
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
like um you know agreed to have the itf

796
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,039
process your data and whatever i suspect

797
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
those just those just stay as long as

798
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,840
you're an itf meeting because it's part

799
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
and parcel being itf meeting um in any

800
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
case i'm not saying with zelda's now but

801
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,120
um this into which people like would

802
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
like to take a look at the notewell and

803
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,399
be sad about it or such revisions that

804
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,600
would be helpful because we just took

805
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,639
the itf one for the moment

806
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
and with that we have all their business

807
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
um which may be nothing but maybe people

808
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,840
who want to stand and speak for

809
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,279
something important or just or suggest

810
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,559
that we discuss one of these topics in

811
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,919
more detail

812
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
oh yeah

813
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,360
uh one quick one this is pete by the way

814
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,840
one quick one for that came up this

815
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,919
morning in rsab

816
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,399
um my thought was that

817
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
meeting-wise we're going to do

818
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
face-to-face

819
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,320
um

820
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
uh simultaneous with ietf meetings even

821
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,399
though we are not officially an ietf

822
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,519
working group

823
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,559
um

824
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,039
and you know we can do everything else

825
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
on the mailing list and there's no

826
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
expectation short of emergencies to have

827
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,279
interims

828
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,399
um

829
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,320
so if if folks think that that is an

830
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,960
acceptable way to go we do need to work

831
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,760
out with the secretariat because this is

832
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,679
a broader community you might want to

833
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,440
attend the rswg at least remotely

834
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
without attending the ietf meeting and

835
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
paying meeting fees

836
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
um that we may need to work out

837
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,679
something to have that happen

838
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
but uh beyond that the logistics seemed

839
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
we'll meet here

840
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
if you're coming to the ietf meeting you

841
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,080
can meet in person otherwise you can

842
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,799
meet remotely

843
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,799
uh lars yeah

844
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,320
that was a good summary thank you and um

845
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
i was

846
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,320
i came mostly here because if we're

847
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
meeting at the ietf right so there's

848
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,000
this text in the rfc that says you know

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,279
the the the

850
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,720
stream manager source what the term was

851
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,240
uh our sub members should actively

852
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,519
participate in the working group right

853
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,919
which we are trying to do however we are

854
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,519
also like pretty busy during the week

855
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,960
and so um

856
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
we probably have created a little bit of

857
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,559
scheduling nightmare here um because you

858
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
need a whole bunch of like four people

859
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
ideally right that own the stream

860
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,039
um so if one of us isn't here maybe at

861
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,000
one of those music it doesn't

862
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
necessarily mean that we're not

863
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,559
interested in actively participating

864
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,399
just or put it on the record it might be

865
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,880
there's conflicts

866
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,480
understood

867
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,840
uh john clenson

868
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,960
two two things briefly one is a comment

869
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
on lars's comment

870
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,240
which is the given the difficulty of

871
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,480
scheduling this meeting

872
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
along with everything else during the

873
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
iatf week

874
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,399
uh in addition to the rs a b problem

875
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,600
there are ordinary working group

876
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,799
problems there's a working group i

877
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,200
should really be in now and uh and i

878
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
discovered that even remotely i can't be

879
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,200
into it two places at the same time

880
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
and that might be a very strong argument

881
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,240
for holding

882
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,799
a significant fraction of these meetings

883
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,519
if not all of them on an interim basis

884
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,360
and entirely remote

885
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,120
um the second observation which is why i

886
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,640
put my hand up

887
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
uh is that we went through

888
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
brian's list or the portion of brian's

889
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,559
list which made it in the agenda

890
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,039
uh rather quickly and i apologize for

891
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,279
joining late if this has already been

892
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,240
covered

893
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
but i want to make certain that we as as

894
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
was said turn these things into tickets

895
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
and and address them on the

896
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,480
on the list

897
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,640
uh because i noticed that a lot of

898
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,720
comments on them through no fault of the

899
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
people though through no falter back or

900
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
other summarizing just did not go into

901
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
the depth that those

902
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,519
bullet point highlights were intended to

903
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,360
to raise based upon

904
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
uh office conversations i've had with

905
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,720
brian about some of them

906
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,800
no absolutely and one of the chairs uh

907
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,599
first duties is to get an issue tracker

908
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,599
set up get those things in

909
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,320
um and get discussion going

910
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,079
as i said earlier and i don't know if

911
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,800
you were present for it we sort of view

912
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,359
before there's a draft about the topic

913
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,079
uh we we will moderate any discussion

914
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,159
that goes on on the list

915
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
um or in meetings on particular topics

916
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,159
until uh you know such momentum has

917
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,239
occurred that we get someone to write it

918
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
down in a draft and ask for adoption and

919
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,079
then it will become a work item but

920
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,239
we'll definitely keep those loose issues

921
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,639
that aren't attached to a draft in part

922
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,440
of the issue tracker so that people can

923
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,679
go and look and say yeah let's get on

924
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,000
this and write a draft

925
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,160
uh that's great and and exactly right uh

926
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
i don't know if others have had the

927
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
problem but it's a selling personal

928
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,760
request be careful if that issue tracker

929
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,040
is in github

930
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,560
because github is wonderful if you are

931
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,079
actively following a particular

932
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,760
conversation all the time

933
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,280
looking at the pull requests uh and uh

934
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,599
and absorbing things that way

935
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,400
but for somebody who is intermittently

936
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,640
tracking a particular effort or

937
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,079
trying to watch that effort while doing

938
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,160
a lot of things it can be so confusing

939
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,599
it's becoming just

940
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,079
has to become useless

941
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,079
uh the proposal we floated earlier john

942
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,760
was that we'd form the discussions on

943
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,160
the sorry make the issues on github but

944
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
the discussion wouldn't happen in a list

945
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
and we'd simply track the status on the

946
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,040
github issues and so that should i

947
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,880
believe capture what you're hoping for

948
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,400
that that should be pretty close at

949
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,839
least if not

950
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,599
if not you've already gotten that far we

951
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,720
can tune it thank you

952
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
sure uh

953
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,959
mark nottingham europe

954
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,359
is that working yeah

955
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,240
uh

956
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,880
so regarding the working style i i

957
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,400
understand that while we're getting

958
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,599
things going

959
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,000
uh synchronous meetings are important

960
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,880
and

961
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
um

962
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,800
but but but hopefully i i would really

963
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
like to see

964
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,440
the group

965
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,599
resolving most of its

966
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,359
issues and having most discussions

967
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
asynchronously i think because

968
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
frankly a lot of people here are pretty

969
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
time poor and as we've seen scheduling

970
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,440
is difficult uh i'd like to see the

971
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
synchronous meetings reserved eventually

972
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
for just you know resolving those issues

973
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,119
that we've identified that really need

974
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,720
that kind of time um so that's what i'd

975
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,480
encourage the chairs to try and move

976
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,359
towards

977
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,359
um and but what i originally got in the

978
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,480
queue for was uh in my mind you know one

979
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,960
of the most urgent and and probably

980
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,440
practical things we can start with

981
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
is figuring out

982
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,760
how to continue the evolution of the

983
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,640
format and that set of documents and and

984
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
you know i i presume that this group has

985
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,359
the authority to do that the question is

986
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,599
as i think gecko was saying you know

987
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,359
what are the details of how we go about

988
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,599
that and so

989
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,200
i guess i have a question you know is is

990
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,440
it really the expectation that we need a

991
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
draft

992
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,680
to propose how we adopt those drafts and

993
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
process them

994
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
and will that proto draft need to go to

995
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,680
an rfc is is that the process we've set

996
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,800
up here

997
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
so 9280 does specify that there needs to

998
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,280
be a draft

999
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
um that that that is actually a

1000
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,400
requirement of 9280. um it does not as

1001
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,880
far as i know need to be an rfc

1002
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,720
uh it gets uh passed over to the rsab

1003
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
and they implement it as a policy or

1004
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,680
they don't

1005
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
um or they they more to the point uh

1006
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
might come back to us with concerns that

1007
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,680
need to be addressed

1008
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
but as far as i know they are not

1009
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,599
published as rfcs

1010
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,960
i think you may perhaps be talking past

1011
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,520
each other um so i think if mark wanted

1012
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
to propose

1013
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,440
mark

1014
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,800
is there anybody working on such a draft

1015
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,839
now

1016
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,320
uh sorry um let me let me try mark maybe

1017
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,079
you and then maybe you can uh you can

1018
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,000
argue with me

1019
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,359
no yes we can hear you but you can't

1020
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,680
hear us

1021
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,440
can you hear me

1022
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,599
can you hear me

1023
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,040
yes

1024
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,839
okay

1025
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,440
um is anybody working on such a draft

1026
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,400
now

1027
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,920
no um

1028
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
so mark i think um let me just try to

1029
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
clarify so i think maybe you and peter

1030
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,680
talking past each other my sense is if

1031
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,760
you wanted to write a draft

1032
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
that was about about evolving the format

1033
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,040
and like you're like the format should

1034
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
all only be like carved and stone

1035
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
tablets you could do that right now and

1036
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
you wouldn't need a protograph to do

1037
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,839
that draft

1038
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,480
um so i think that i think that but the

1039
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,760
eventually proposal has to be in form of

1040
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
draft but i don't think we need a draft

1041
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,200
to create a process to update the

1042
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
the the

1043
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
format

1044
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,480
if you had like i think if you have

1045
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,599
ideas about how to take the format i

1046
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,640
think you can provision directly you

1047
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
don't need a draft to propose how to

1048
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,520
propose it

1049
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,200
well

1050
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,520
i i so i'd like to see you know this

1051
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,920
group start working on the evolution um

1052
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
not necessarily as

1053
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
i i think that we need to think about

1054
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,599
how we go about that and what the right

1055
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,839
process for it is um

1056
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,400
so it sounds like we do maybe need

1057
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
a draft for that

1058
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
perhaps i think i think if you have a

1059
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,320
structure in mind we would need

1060
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
something to document i'm sure we need

1061
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,440
some words otherwise let's just adopt

1062
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
them you know i mean

1063
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,280
yeah well i think if we had i guess my

1064
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,880
sense is we need a group of people who

1065
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
want to work on updating the format and

1066
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,800
enough agreement that we think we can

1067
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,720
make some progress on that and then if

1068
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,920
there's something complicated that isn't

1069
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,599
just we're just going to like rev the

1070
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,119
rev the documents

1071
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,800
then um

1072
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
then we need to figure out that is going

1073
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,079
to write the document adopt a best

1074
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,119
basically

1075
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,400
right well to be clear there's already a

1076
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,720
revision underway

1077
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,800
right that so that my understanding is

1078
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,760
that that revision should at least be

1079
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,079
partly taken over by this group

1080
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,040
okay

1081
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,400
and what i need we should start doing

1082
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,720
that and i'm looking for how to do that

1083
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
yeah um

1084
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,520
i think the question the question that's

1085
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
also resolved um that was sort of being

1086
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
sort of bounced around earlier is

1087
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,319
exactly like should this group own the

1088
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,079
entire thing soup the nuts including the

1089
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,160
names the tags or should it not and i

1090
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,520
think that that was like a question

1091
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
which i think maybe robert and i and

1092
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,800
like i'm happy to do what the community

1093
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,000
wants to do so i'm not here to like

1094
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
enforce anything in particular um

1095
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,079
um but like um i felt like there was

1096
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,440
some sense from like mike and others

1097
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,400
maybe we should know the names of the

1098
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
tags but maybe maybe i misunderstood so

1099
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,720
let's see what people think

1100
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,599
oh and okay next we have elliot

1101
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,440
mark sorry

1102
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,359
well just just to to that point uh you

1103
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,000
know that to me the names of the tags is

1104
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,160
the core semantics and

1105
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,319
i i think that's you know

1106
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,160
that's not implementation

1107
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,480
thank you

1108
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,240
now i wanted to add one quick comment

1109
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,880
which is i know john levine

1110
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
has been documenting a number of issues

1111
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,920
uh that he's facing and

1112
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
it would be good if um this group

1113
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,800
invited him to discuss those

1114
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,079
so that when we make sure that we're

1115
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,920
capturing everything that he's seeing at

1116
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,720
the operational level and then you can

1117
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,040
get a feel for oh that's policy that's

1118
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
not policy and

1119
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,000
and you know you get a little running

1120
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,440
code in the process thanks

1121
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,160
so with respect to seven nine and one

1122
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,599
bis we actually discussed a little bit

1123
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,640
between

1124
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,480
uh the rs app or the stream owners or

1125
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,400
we're gonna call this and the ipc and

1126
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,680
and one

1127
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,640
proposal would be um to because i think

1128
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
john said that basically we're at a

1129
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
state where

1130
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,640
791 bus actually finally describes

1131
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,200
accurately what the tooling is doing

1132
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,280
and so one way would be to actually

1133
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,119
publish this as is as a record and then

1134
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,599
start to work the continuing work here

1135
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,920
to do because otherwise we have taken a

1136
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,680
document that has sort of been

1137
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
long coming and and

1138
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,599
we've been waiting for

1139
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,000
um and we potentially delay it more

1140
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,599
because people want to do more stuff so

1141
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,760
i i personally would prefer if we could

1142
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,319
publish this relatively quickly and then

1143
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,920
do the work here

1144
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,839
to do 791 bisbees

1145
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,440
my sense is we would need to sign off on

1146
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,000
that but yeah

1147
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to this group right because it's clearly

1148
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,520
in your charter and if you didn't want

1149
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,200
to do this you you

1150
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,119
couldn't you uh

1151
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,079
you can choose not to do it but i would

1152
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,040
recommend we do it that way

1153
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
kind of similar about what i wanted to

1154
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,240
say because this is really a abyss

1155
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,000
document um that just fixes stuff

1156
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,839
um and it's a biz document of an iab

1157
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,839
stream document and i think that the

1158
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,680
faster way to proceed here would just be

1159
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
published with this also on the iab

1160
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,599
stream and then you start over new

1161
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,920
uh with a clean version basically i'm

1162
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,640
happy to like have a short

1163
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,400
discussion or kind of a short feedback

1164
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,000
round here if this is ready to go but i

1165
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,839
would still take it on the ib stream and

1166
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,720
get it done quickly

1167
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
i mean my sense is 90 280 does not

1168
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,279
permit that

1169
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,920
i mean it's an update of an ib document

1170
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,440
right so this is like any way in the

1171
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,119
gray zone

1172
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,000
i don't think it's really in the gray

1173
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,760
zone but okay um i think it's in the

1174
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,000
gray zone so the the um

1175
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,400
seven nine and one

1176
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
uh what yeah what does it not permit

1177
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,200
i don't believe that i do not believe

1178
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
the ib can bust this document published

1179
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,079
as an rfc and have it be binding on

1180
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,079
anything

1181
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,599
i think it has to come through rswg

1182
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,839
because we are we are we you know we are

1183
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,359
now the sole authority i'm like i'm like

1184
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,960
what the rfc series looks like so but

1185
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,040
this is a that's what i'm saying so this

1186
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,119
is an ib document this is a biz document

1187
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,040
that fixes things

1188
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,000
so it's not like a new thing right and

1189
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
it's like this document might anyway

1190
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,839
anyway be

1191
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,920
in a line where we don't know if it's

1192
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,680
policy or not right it's not it's like

1193
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,359
it's not clear policy or something like

1194
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,599
that well but miria i mean

1195
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,480
you could say that you know there's a

1196
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,520
whole bunch of stuff that happened in

1197
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
previous documents that were in the iab

1198
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
stream

1199
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and i think now that we've converted

1200
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
over to rswg

1201
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,119
at least now that it's established

1202
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,560
that that document sounds like it

1203
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
belongs on the editorial stream and

1204
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,480
should come through the working group

1205
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
even though the previous one was in the

1206
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,520
iab

1207
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,760
i i don't think that makes it great

1208
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,200
and i don't care at the end we need the

1209
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,440
roc right right right right and what i'm

1210
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,200
saying here is that the work is already

1211
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
done i think we should just publish it

1212
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
right now

1213
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,680
in the fastest way we can and i think

1214
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,960
just proving it by the ib having

1215
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,240
published as a best document is the

1216
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
fastest way we can and then start the

1217
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,680
actual work in this group

1218
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,839
i i agree i don't think there's a

1219
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,280
difference in

1220
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,040
you know us calling the consensus or the

1221
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,960
iab calling the consensus at this point

1222
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,599
i i think it will accomplish that in the

1223
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,280
same amount of time

1224
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,839
um it would just simply be a bringing to

1225
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,079
this group make sure that we're agreed

1226
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,800
that the community is okay with 7991 bis

1227
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,680
and

1228
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,359
we call the consensus and pass it over

1229
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,560
to the rsab to approve

1230
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,480
i i don't think it's going to take any

1231
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,079
less time for the iab to go through the

1232
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,640
same process

1233
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,800
i'm not sure but we can we can't try

1234
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,319
anything so like this group has to

1235
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,359
decide

1236
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,759
i'm not

1237
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
mark

1238
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,560
no

1239
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,680
no no

1240
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,440
okay

1241
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,800
okay

1242
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,079
um

1243
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,150
i don't think it's

1244
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,440
[Music]

1245
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
the characterization that people want to

1246
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,720
add new things to it is not really

1247
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,400
relevant i'm sure that somebody out

1248
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,000
there somewhere maybe does but that's

1249
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,359
not what's top of mind for me

1250
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,560
it's that the current this document

1251
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,440
uh uh incorporates a lot of changes to

1252
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,240
79 91 whatever it was

1253
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,200
that

1254
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,280
were inserted by

1255
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,040
the tooling effectively

1256
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,599
and that may be the right thing to do

1257
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,359
but those changes need to see some

1258
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,280
daylight and i think that they need to

1259
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,359
go through this working group process

1260
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,640
and make sure that we understand what

1261
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,920
those changes are that they're the right

1262
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,119
changes to make

1263
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,400
and then we can publish it and i don't

1264
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
think that's going to add a lot of time

1265
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
um but i think it's the right thing to

1266
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,400
do i i don't think anyone's proposing oh

1267
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
let's open up 7991 and add a bunch of

1268
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,160
new tags and do a bunch of new stuff

1269
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,280
that's that's not what's really on the

1270
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,200
table we do want to get it out fast i

1271
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
agree with that

1272
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,319
but we need to make sure that the

1273
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,079
changes that have happened to date have

1274
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,240
seen appropriate daylight

1275
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,319
so i just want to comment quickly

1276
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,160
because i mean i

1277
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,599
john is more the expert than i am but

1278
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,119
you know these changes have happened

1279
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,480
already they are already deployed and

1280
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,000
they are all in the tooling we are just

1281
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,040
updating the documents yes and and it's

1282
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,800
still quite a mess as i understand it

1283
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,400
well okay without taking position on the

1284
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,280
technical matter of the data right the

1285
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,880
changes were made without any consensus

1286
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,400
process at all that's the purpose of

1287
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,079
this is now to have a consensus process

1288
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,680
that like creates the entire community

1289
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,250
[Music]

1290
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,800
are you still on this topic john oh yes

1291
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,119
um because we do have a cue and i assume

1292
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,359
on the same topic so no no this is

1293
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,400
apropos this particular thing yes um i

1294
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
agree there's a whole bunch of changes

1295
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,760
many of which i don't think we're a good

1296
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,079
idea either okay but they are the way

1297
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,359
that they are the way we've been

1298
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,920
publishing rfcs for the past year

1299
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,160
so in particular if you say this change

1300
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,760
this change was a bad idea and we should

1301
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
back it out

1302
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,119
we can't do that without without also

1303
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,319
saying and what are we going to do about

1304
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,079
all the public about all with all the

1305
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,480
rfcs that use it are we good you know

1306
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,359
i think

1307
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,200
i mean i think we we need to make a pass

1308
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,440
over the xml and reissue them

1309
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
with cleaning up the xml but my guess is

1310
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,960
that's going to take more than more than

1311
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,440
a few days of discussion

1312
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,200
understood

1313
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,799
um robert you're in the cube

1314
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,229
[Music]

1315
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
so

1316
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,400
i

1317
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,680
want to express my support for

1318
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,800
publishing

1319
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,960
the

1320
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,920
what's been built

1321
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,160
even if we disagree

1322
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,599
that

1323
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,960
what's been built is what we should be

1324
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,720
doing

1325
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,240
um

1326
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,599
i think that having that captured

1327
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,240
so that we can document the rfcs that

1328
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,839
have been published to date is going to

1329
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,520
be important while we are going through

1330
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
the fight about whether or not we

1331
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,000
actually

1332
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,680
revise

1333
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,280
rfcs

1334
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,119
you know to republish that's going to be

1335
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,880
a long fight

1336
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,079
so i would like to

1337
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,720
actually have an rfc artifact that says

1338
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,400
this is what the tooling is currently

1339
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,599
doing

1340
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,160
um even if it's full of commentary that

1341
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,680
says we don't think he should do that

1342
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,800
anymore

1343
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,599
and then do the step that says this is

1344
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,480
what we should change

1345
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,400
paul you're up next

1346
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,520
so one problem we have in this and i

1347
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,240
really really want to emphasize this

1348
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,680
70 79 77 91 bis is not a bis document

1349
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,720
it is a description of a

1350
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,160
possibly bad implementation

1351
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,960
it is also a good implementation which

1352
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,319
is why

1353
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,880
the implementer did it but let's stop

1354
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,400
thinking about this is 7991 bis

1355
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,480
going back to what maria said it would

1356
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,720
be good for us to publish

1357
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,800
a document that says

1358
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,200
what are we doing today and

1359
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,680
actually backtrack it to and we started

1360
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,040
doing these things on this date

1361
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,119
but it's not fodder for starting 79.91

1362
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,440
bits some of the stuff will go in some

1363
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,520
of it won't there will be a consensus

1364
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,599
process but let's

1365
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,480
conceptually really split that out

1366
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,280
between a document that says

1367
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,319
starting on this date xml rfcs started

1368
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,079
looking like this

1369
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,720
and what do we want later completely

1370
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,118
different work

1371
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,400
and a big thumbs up from mike in the

1372
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,359
corner

1373
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,599
uh elliott you're up

1374
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,720
hi uh

1375
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,640
a question and a comment

1376
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,480
um i'll go with the comment first my

1377
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,240
question will be for paul just so you

1378
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,160
know paul

1379
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,680
my comment is

1380
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,760
that it seems like what we have here is

1381
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,559
a great great opportunity to sort of

1382
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,119
exercise the process a little bit

1383
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,920
um and hopefully on something that

1384
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,760
isn't quite

1385
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,359
i was going to say too controversial but

1386
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,040
now i'm not so sure

1387
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,040
but i actually look forward to seeing

1388
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
that i think it's a good thing for the

1389
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,800
work to happen here and not the iab for

1390
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
exactly this reason that we should learn

1391
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,880
how to use our processes to do these

1392
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,800
update these updates

1393
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
unless there's something that's

1394
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,839
absolutely critical that has to happen

1395
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,119
yesterday

1396
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,440
and then i'm not even sure then the iab

1397
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,040
should deal with it

1398
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,680
my co my question to paul

1399
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,800
was

1400
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
if you don't view this

1401
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
the document is abyss document

1402
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
is it setting a standard i don't mean in

1403
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,440
the ietf sense but i mean in terms of

1404
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,000
the specification sense is it setting a

1405
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,319
a set of rules by which the the

1406
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,880
documents are published or is it doc

1407
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,119
what is it documenting because i sort of

1408
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,839
lost you there a little bit um about

1409
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,440
what it is you wanted

1410
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,079
thanks for for clarifying

1411
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,400
um this is paul hoffman so i believe

1412
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,559
what it is documenting is an

1413
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,640
implementation of 7991 which was done by

1414
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,800
an implementer who changed a lot of

1415
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,359
things on purpose documented some of

1416
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,079
them

1417
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,160
they some of them got backtracked but it

1418
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,800
is an implementation description

1419
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,920
document

1420
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,920
it is not a standard and it was

1421
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,640
certainly not agreed to in the way that

1422
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,520
the original spec was agreed to which

1423
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,359
was it was an iab document it had a

1424
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,400
lively ietf last call changes were you

1425
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,480
know like like it the original document

1426
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,640
was that way this is not documenting

1427
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
something that went through that process

1428
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,440
it's an implementation

1429
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,040
so

1430
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,839
before lars you make a comment i have a

1431
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,640
question that you and other stream heads

1432
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,200
are probably going to need to answer

1433
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,319
which is are you comfortable

1434
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,079
with

1435
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,000
rswg publishing a document which in

1436
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,680
effect says

1437
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,280
we have an implementation of how

1438
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,079
um

1439
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,440
xml is being used right now in rfcs we

1440
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,280
are publishing this document for the

1441
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,680
purpose of documenting that for people

1442
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,280
who are using it

1443
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,359
and in the future we are going to

1444
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,599
likely set new policy

1445
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,880
which

1446
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,800
creates you know what we're going to do

1447
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,559
in the future but

1448
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:13,359
this

1449
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,040
documents it for

1450
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,319
purposes of um use only

1451
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,319
is that a comfortable thing to do for

1452
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,680
this group

1453
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,520
the last segment yes so this is actually

1454
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,040
what i was going to say uh coming to the

1455
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,119
microphone you said it for me so i don't

1456
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,160
i think all of this is fine so i i

1457
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,839
personally would like a document that

1458
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,280
that describes what the current tools

1459
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,559
are doing i think that's also what

1460
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,720
robert's concern is that we we have sort

1461
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,880
of a description of of what we are have

1462
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,920
now

1463
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,760
uh whether that's what we want or not is

1464
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,839
is up to debate and i am hearing it's

1465
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,359
not that's fine right i don't really

1466
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,680
have not religious views here but i

1467
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,720
we've

1468
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,040
operated for too long uh

1469
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,880
in a situation where

1470
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,640
the description of what should be done

1471
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,400
and what action was done were different

1472
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,800
and it confused a lot of things

1473
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,319
and if we have a chance to sort of align

1474
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,160
that and then move on from it pretty

1475
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,599
much immediately that that's completely

1476
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,920
fine whether it's 1791 biz or not i

1477
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,079
actually don't care right it could be an

1478
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,440
individual document that says here's a

1479
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,800
description of the tool

1480
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,760
um

1481
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,760
and we leave it at that

1482
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,000
okay

1483
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,839
oh and lars that's right back to you if

1484
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,720
we publish the document like that

1485
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,040
would that need to be on the rswg stream

1486
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,880
on the editorial stream or could that be

1487
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,400
on a different stream

1488
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,440
i guess my take

1489
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,839
with chair hat on is

1490
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,040
it's not necessarily setting policy it

1491
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,319
is purely descriptive of the tool so it

1492
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,319
need not be

1493
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,480
on the rswg but if the street if the

1494
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,200
rsab thinks that it's okay to put that

1495
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,880
kind of policy

1496
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
in the editorial stream

1497
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,799
i don't think i have i don't have a

1498
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,480
problem taking it on as a working group

1499
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,319
item

1500
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,480
miria you want to comment on this or

1501
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,000
other pieces of it

1502
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,520
so this is just um not as ib chair or

1503
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,599
offset member or whatever um you know

1504
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,839
this work the biz document is already

1505
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,440
done it's really just like reflecting

1506
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,960
what's implemented

1507
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,200
it needs to be published and i think

1508
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,799
it's a waste of time for this group we

1509
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,559
should and like because elliot says this

1510
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,400
might be a good thing to like test our

1511
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
process but it's not because it's done

1512
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,760
we need just to publish it we should

1513
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,359
take on more important issues on this

1514
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,839
group

1515
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,240
uh echo from the floor yeah i got down

1516
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,359
here because i wasn't sure there's a

1517
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,160
chair comment or personal comment um

1518
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,480
so it seems to me this document has two

1519
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,880
despite having one set of text has two

1520
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,240
meanings one set of meetings is this is

1521
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,359
the

1522
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,720
behavior of this tool on the structure

1523
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,319
of the documents up until the moment

1524
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,760
this document's published

1525
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
and that is a documentation function

1526
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,559
and the second is and going forward if

1527
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,520
you wish to have your things published

1528
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,280
it must conform to the syntax until it

1529
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,040
changes and that is that is a policy and

1530
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,480
specification function

1531
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,280
and

1532
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,720
now we've been operating in this like

1533
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,119
law free zone where

1534
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,079
the

1535
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,520
tool just dictated these policy

1536
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,359
decisions and like when it never had

1537
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,520
consensus but

1538
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
like we have to but but the point of the

1539
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,640
exercise is to get to the point where

1540
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,079
that's no longer the case and where

1541
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,280
those policies decisions come from

1542
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,119
somewhere and so people which like cease

1543
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,640
publishing rfcs

1544
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,839
um

1545
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,200
from the moment this doc has published

1546
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,400
until our business is published then

1547
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,760
that's like totally criminal and that

1548
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,200
document can go anywhere including on a

1549
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,599
website but if people wish to be out of

1550
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,520
the law free zone and have a document

1551
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,680
which has text which enforces text about

1552
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
how things have supposed to behave then

1553
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,839
that has to come from

1554
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,440
here otherwise like i don't understand i

1555
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,720
don't know otherwise i don't understand

1556
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,559
what right anybody in the rpc has to say

1557
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,920
you're not going to look like x versus

1558
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
one

1559
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,480
mark is up to bat

1560
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,880
no there it is working

1561
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,680
um

1562
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,799
so people are talking about this

1563
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,119
document as as it's

1564
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,680
documenting what a tool does

1565
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,839
the problem is is that there are more

1566
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,559
than one tool now touching this format

1567
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,720
and i find it really confusing and

1568
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,799
concerning that the ietf which is

1569
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,079
supposed to be

1570
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,000
you know this body of knowledge and

1571
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,960
people who understand how

1572
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,640
interoperability works

1573
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,559
are basing something on one

1574
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,680
implementation and not on

1575
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,920
documenting an interoperable format that

1576
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,599
people can write tools to

1577
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,400
um i don't think this document is done i

1578
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,119
think

1579
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,760
it needs people to at least understand

1580
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,839
you know what decisions have been made

1581
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,119
and we need to make sure that we make

1582
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,280
some practical decisions about what it

1583
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,280
contains it may be that there are some

1584
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,119
things that aren't optimal that we still

1585
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,319
leave in

1586
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,000
but we can't just wave our hands and say

1587
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,599
oh that's not our problem that doesn't

1588
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,720
make any sense to me at all

1589
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,280
julian you are up

1590
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
julian you have to turn on your

1591
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,839
microphone and

1592
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,240
video

1593
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,920
there you are

1594
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,720
okay sorry sorry for that um hopefully

1595
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,480
this works i don't have a headset here i

1596
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,319
didn't expect that i wanted to say

1597
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,079
something

1598
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,839
i wanted to point out two things um

1599
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,640
what

1600
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,440
we are going to do here is

1601
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,359
essentially exactly

1602
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,359
what was planned

1603
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,319
quickly after 791 was published because

1604
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,599
that was published with the

1605
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,760
understanding that this is a snapshot

1606
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,079
that would be quickly revised

1607
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,559
based on implementation feedback

1608
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,720
and how long is that ago seven years

1609
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,880
eight years so what we are doing now

1610
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,760
hopefully is starting that work properly

1611
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,400
that should have started ages ago

1612
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,720
and it's good that we are doing that

1613
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,200
the other thing um i mentioned on the

1614
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,240
chat

1615
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,359
um

1616
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,520
there are different kinds of flaws in

1617
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,280
the biz document

1618
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,400
and actually in the 791 as well

1619
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,640
and some of them

1620
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,760
if we fix them we will have to touch

1621
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
published canonical xml

1622
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,079
because it affects metadata and the meta

1623
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,000
data definitions are

1624
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,079
ambiguous

1625
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,640
and we have open tickets for that and i

1626
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,559
think we really really should not

1627
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,680
publish anything as rfc

1628
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,160
for which we know that we will have to

1629
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,079
take it back

1630
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:42,960
so

1631
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,359
publishing a snapshot is good as long as

1632
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,400
we are

1633
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,640
roughly okay with the contents

1634
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,079
and those issues that will affect

1635
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,920
published xml

1636
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,599
and that we will have to convert these

1637
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,280
documents once

1638
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
should be on our top list and we should

1639
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,760
work on that first and then if we have

1640
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,720
that

1641
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,359
resolved we can consider publishing a

1642
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,480
snapshot as rfc

1643
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,440
so um we are

1644
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,440
now out of time and have five people

1645
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,040
left in the queue

1646
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,000
um

1647
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,680
we can creep over a couple of minutes

1648
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,520
until we are chased out

1649
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,680
uh but paul if you would like to make a

1650
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,960
quick comment

1651
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,319
i would like to make a quick comment

1652
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,480
that this will not be quick

1653
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,079
and therefore i don't think it's

1654
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,480
appropriate to have the iab just publish

1655
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,640
it i think it should be in a place where

1656
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,520
it can be discussed

1657
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
thank you miriah

1658
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,160
so poor yes it should be but it will not

1659
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,079
be quick right so that's why i would

1660
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,440
like to publish this and then start a

1661
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,040
new document

1662
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,480
um and and the reason why i want to

1663
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,720
publish this is i want to use mark's um

1664
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,000
argument against him it's

1665
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,319
interoperability right um other

1666
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,599
implementations should be able to

1667
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,680
actually implement what we need

1668
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,359
and so we need to document it and that's

1669
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,280
a reason and like what i'm hearing is

1670
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,720
that i don't like this group needs

1671
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,319
consensus to publish something we will

1672
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,920
not reach this consensus so i don't

1673
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
think publishing this document as it is

1674
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,599
in this group is actually an option but

1675
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,839
i still think we should publish it

1676
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,480
lars yeah looks like i

1677
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,480
agree with maria that i think we

1678
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,799
should publish this as a record of where

1679
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,200
we are and and i also

1680
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,359
i'm fine with if the rswg wants to

1681
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,680
publish this document on the editorial

1682
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,359
stream because i mean we're not starting

1683
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,960
from a clean slate like far from it

1684
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,720
right we have a little history here and

1685
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,280
it's complicated and i think we can

1686
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,960
if you know if you hold our nose and we

1687
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,559
say you know this is not perfect but

1688
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,720
it's what the current tooling requires

1689
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,000
to get internet drafts and rfc is

1690
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,400
published

1691
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,160
and it'll change in the future but

1692
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,520
here's what it currently is i think

1693
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,200
there's value in that

1694
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,720
and

1695
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,480
you know i agree with mark right it's

1696
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,559
it's it hasn't seen consensus or not

1697
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,720
enough and and it's really sort of based

1698
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,640
on what one implementer did but it is

1699
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,559
what it is and and basically pretending

1700
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,880
it isn't is not going to help anybody so

1701
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,039
i really want to publish if we can and

1702
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,119
then immediately as soon as that start

1703
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,440
the work of doing a consensus-based

1704
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,839
follow-on

1705
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,760
uh john i believe you have the last word

1706
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,119
on this topic sorry julian we are over

1707
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,760
um i i thought mary and i were in

1708
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,200
complete agreement until her last

1709
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,000
sentence and now i'm not sure anymore

1710
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,640
um partially because i agree with mark i

1711
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,400
think it's important to get a snapshot

1712
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,559
of this thing published and publish it

1713
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,960
soon but make clear that that snapshot

1714
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,119
is a snapshot of an implementation

1715
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,559
that's not normative there's no

1716
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,720
expectation that other implementations

1717
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,119
should run off and conform to it until

1718
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,280
it's an opportunity to discuss the

1719
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,680
issues of contention i think a snapshot

1720
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,200
helps us figure out where those issues

1721
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,440
content and contention are that's a good

1722
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,680
idea but i think we need to be very very

1723
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,440
clear about what we're doing here

1724
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,599
thank you

1725
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,400
so

1726
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,079
i'm hearing that what we're gonna do is

1727
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,920
hopefully paul has some good notes on

1728
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,160
this and post them to the list

1729
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,119
um

1730
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,440
we will watch the list for a little

1731
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,119
while see if people have additional

1732
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,440
comments that change what has been said

1733
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,280
in the room and then ecker and i will

1734
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,520
put our heads together and see

1735
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,119
what we've heard

1736
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,680
um and come out with some sort of call

1737
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,799
on this

1738
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,160
uh

1739
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,599
all right with that

1740
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,079
we are three minutes over and much

1741
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,440
appreciated and

1742
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,760
i'm surprised we actually got some

1743
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,520
substantive discussion done so that's

1744
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,559
nice

1745
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,960
thank you all

1746
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,680
if it is

1747
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,039
for them

1748
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,880
you
