1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
it's barely 30 here

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,200
it's probably

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
yeah i can't read that colin but it's

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,720
probably about 35 here in zurich

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,760
not focusing i guess but 17 degrees in

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
glasgow

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
that's not a heat wave okay you're fine

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
maybe maybe you make the right decision

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,640
32 in zurich

10
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,760
apparently it's only 28 here today right

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,960
now i mean it's 8 30 right

12
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
for the folks on the other end of me to

13
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,520
go we're still getting settled in the

14
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
room we haven't forgotten about you

15
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,400
please stand by

16
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
all right uh good morning so i just took

17
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,519
a little while because my mail.app

18
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
become unresponsive and it's still

19
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
unresponsive and i know what that means

20
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
um so

21
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
um we have a bunch of people in the room

22
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
um

23
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
we have a bunch of people online i see

24
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
at least colin i think i saw elliot so

25
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,760
we have i think everybody who's on the

26
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
rsap except for jay who sends us

27
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
apologies he isn't feeling well

28
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
um

29
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
and we have an agenda that's been

30
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
published um

31
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
and as we set this meeting up uh so

32
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
thanks for being flexible um

33
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
isaac meetings are supposed to be public

34
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,279
we didn't sort of envision when we wrote

35
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,720
this stuff during covet that we would

36
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
have in-person meetings again for the

37
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
rsap and so we realized that the

38
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
logistics of having

39
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
meetings that are open for observation

40
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
at an itf sort of pose some challenges

41
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
in terms of

42
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
sizing the room and since we had to have

43
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
this one

44
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
during the itf on short notice because

45
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
we realized that otherwise we would have

46
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,519
had to wait until september

47
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,800
we needed to shuffle a bunch of stuff

48
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
and so we're in this isg breakfast room

49
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,079
where

50
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,839
not a lot of observers are going to fit

51
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,440
in but um

52
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
i think we're doing fine at the moment

53
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
still and we can grow some and i hear we

54
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,000
have quite a few people online which is

55
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
also great to see

56
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
um

57
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
before we start i want to sort of jay

58
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
yesterday informed the isg and ib that

59
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
the hiring of the rsce is going

60
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
according to the timeline i think

61
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
they've finished the first round of

62
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
interviews

63
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,760
um

64
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,079
and they were gonna discuss i think

65
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,600
thursday this week what they're going to

66
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
do uh knowledge isn't feeling so great

67
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
we'll see if that timeline slips a

68
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,920
little bit but basically they are going

69
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
to decide whether they have a candidate

70
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
that they can go forward with in terms

71
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
of the hiring process or if they're

72
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
going to do a second round of interviews

73
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
with an expanded group of candidates

74
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,240
and that's all i know so i wanted to

75
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,519
pass that on

76
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
as you know once we have an rse hired

77
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
they will join the rsap

78
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
as well but we can already get started

79
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
without that

80
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,639
um

81
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,399
the agenda is

82
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
published does anybody want to bash it

83
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
i can't hear you

84
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
you can hand over the initial stuff here

85
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
for cindy but i still come to you right

86
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,399
if you want you can help hand over the

87
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,560
initial stuff to cindy now okay that is

88
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
an excellent idea i will hand over the

89
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,440
initial stuff to cindy thanks maria

90
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
okay um hopefully the folks who are on

91
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
the other end can hear me

92
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
um

93
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
the first thing on the agenda is

94
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
actually bashing the agenda so i just

95
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
want to run through these slides real

96
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
quick so that we can see what there's

97
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
anything to bash

98
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
um but there is agenda bash discussing

99
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
how the rslab our saab excuse me wants

100
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
to handle minute approval

101
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,040
um

102
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,199
discussing how the rsab wants to set

103
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,839
their meeting schedule going forward

104
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
the selection of the rsab chair or if

105
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,079
not actually a selection today then the

106
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
process for how you'll do that

107
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
um

108
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
a discussion with the folks from rsoc

109
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
because they had some points they wanted

110
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
to raise for rsab

111
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,599
and then

112
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
uh discussion

113
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,959
this would be a standing item about

114
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
document approval there's nothing here

115
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,680
yet but um possibly some tooling related

116
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
discussion here about how that we want

117
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,199
to handle that in a data tracker

118
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
um and then the last thing would be

119
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
another standing item for rpc things to

120
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,880
note and we've got sandy here and i

121
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
think alice is on the other end of

122
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
midiko if there's anything they needed

123
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
to talk about

124
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
so anything to bash on this agenda

125
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
so i have a bash and um so i also

126
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
invited the chairs of the rswg to join

127
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
and peter's here and ecker said he might

128
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
try to make it

129
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,600
um because we might wanna also have a

130
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
chat with them about how we're gonna

131
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
actually do the handoff of work from the

132
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,839
rswg to the rsap

133
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,519
um

134
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
so so that's why they're here and maybe

135
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
we add that as a quick discussion

136
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
somewhere

137
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,959
and something's beeping

138
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
anything from remote from elite or

139
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,279
collins that sounds good to you

140
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
i'm good with that that's fine

141
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
okay uh then if there's nothing else to

142
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,160
bash on the agenda the next one is

143
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
meeting minutes uh how does rsab want to

144
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,079
handle approving them do you want to do

145
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
it by email

146
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,040
do you need

147
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,639
if you would do it the way the iab does

148
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
theirs it's you have one person who

149
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,720
explicitly says yes and no objection

150
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
then they are considered approved

151
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
or do you want to do something else

152
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,959
so i think we also like we want to

153
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,560
publish meeting minutes and not a

154
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
transcript right yeah um the meeting

155
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,920
minutes can be published as part of the

156
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
this it'll be set up in the data tracker

157
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
like uh how inter meetings are you can

158
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
put meeting materials so that's where

159
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
the minutes will go yeah

160
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
um

161
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
i think having one person signing up is

162
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
a good process at least

163
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
also we are just a handful of people but

164
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,519
still

165
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,480
i agree

166
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,199
but who do we just rotate or whoever is

167
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,000
first so on the iab like it's enough

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
that any iab member signs up and reads

169
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
it but usually it's me

170
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,959
that works for us as well

171
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
okay but i think one one is fine right

172
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
this is just a sanity check and

173
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
typically there's nothing really to

174
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
check because the secretary is very

175
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
accurate

176
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
okay so we'll we'll have basically the

177
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,000
first

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
rsap person that responds to the email

179
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
you take as approval by the rsep of the

180
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,560
minutes and then

181
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
publish them

182
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,199
and just to confirm that you guys are

183
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,560
okay uh reviewing the minutes via email

184
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,360
yes okay i don't think we want to get on

185
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,759
the chat just for that

186
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,120
had to ask

187
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
uh if there's nothing else on meeting

188
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
minutes then the next thing is the rsap

189
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
meeting schedule do you want to try and

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,519
schedule a regular

191
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
monthly or some other interval meeting

192
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
or just schedule them as needed based on

193
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
stuff coming out of rswg

194
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
um so i'm actually so this touches the

195
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
topic a little bit about online meetings

196
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
or in-person meetings

197
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
and i don't think there's like a huge

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,199
need for impression meetings on the

199
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,720
other hand if everybody is in the same

200
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
city it's like actually nice to meet in

201
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
person

202
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
um i'm i'm not expecting that we will

203
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
have very lot of documents to handle at

204
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
the very beginning

205
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
um but uh

206
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,039
we might want to have some kind of

207
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,960
standing meeting uh to figure out if

208
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
there are any rpc issues

209
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,039
um so

210
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,240
like i was thinking about just

211
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,919
scheduling a meeting once per meeting

212
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
cycle at this point but like i'm not

213
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
sure what your input is from the rpc

214
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
side

215
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
for right now i think once per meeting

216
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,919
makes sense i mean it may turn out that

217
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,280
we want more

218
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
um but we could

219
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
you know address that as necessary

220
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,480
yes

221
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
i agreed so

222
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,039
since we go ahead con

223
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,120
so sorry i just i was gonna say do we

224
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
have a feel for how often the rswg is

225
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,799
likely to meet initially

226
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
i don't know pete might

227
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
what the what the meeting cadence of the

228
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
rswg will be and then

229
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
how do you see

230
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
we haven't really talked about it but

231
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
i've been presuming that we're just

232
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,919
doing ietf meetings and and mailing list

233
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,720
in between for rswg

234
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
okay so i would actually so i think we

235
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
should have a meeting

236
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
at the ietf because we're also talking

237
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
about the ipc organizes at the moment a

238
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
separate stream managers

239
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,320
lunch i think it is right cendy and i

240
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,679
think we chatted a little bit of this

241
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,520
mirror and me chatted and i think it

242
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
would make sense to roll that into the

243
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,760
rsap meeting because it's the same

244
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
people basically um

245
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
and we're already talking about rpc

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
production stuff in this group as well

247
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,400
and so having yet another group with

248
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,559
meeting with the same people is fine and

249
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
if you want to buy us food you can still

250
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,919
do that but

251
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,760
i don't i don't think so and if you're

252
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
rolling that in i think it would make

253
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,240
sense because you guys probably want to

254
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
have that at the ietf

255
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
um

256
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,679
yeah we can do that the other thing is

257
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
at some point we had

258
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
tried to

259
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,799
move that meeting outside of iitf week

260
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,720
to free up some of the leadership time

261
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
so it's also possible we could schedule

262
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
phone you know teleconferences or

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
something

264
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,919
separate

265
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
from you know if that works

266
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
i think but we if we're doing the rsap

267
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
meeting during the ietf and i think

268
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,039
there's some some good reasons for that

269
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,880
also with syncing up with the rswg for

270
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
example which is then going to meet that

271
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,360
week

272
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,240
i think

273
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
a breakfast like this or or the lunch

274
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,080
slot that we had sort of

275
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,160
scheduled in on the wednesday lunches or

276
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
something that that might then

277
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
then work going forward and we can i

278
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,559
think

279
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,960
in between right as the need arises as

280
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
work comes from the rswg we can

281
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,400
either you know do uh online meetings

282
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
or we can also just approve things from

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
the rswg by email right i don't

284
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320
necessarily need to meet for that we

285
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,400
just need a minute and uh

286
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
announce it

287
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,320
so one of the things that all sounds

288
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,159
pretty good to me

289
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
um you know

290
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
the i think the most important thing to

291
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,039
me

292
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
is that the meetings are properly

293
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
announced you know

294
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
enough in advance

295
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
and that when the rswg presents the

296
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
arsab with a document that it is handled

297
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
in a timely fashion and if we need to

298
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,679
meet in order for that to if there are

299
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
issues we need to meet then we'll just

300
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,639
schedule the meeting

301
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,480
so the only um thing that slightly

302
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,320
worries me is that rs i mean rsab is

303
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
explicitly for policy issues right

304
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
so if there are

305
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
anything where we want to get input from

306
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,039
the stream managers about operational

307
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,000
things

308
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
we want those to be separate

309
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
i i think we can

310
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
do this as part of this meeting um and

311
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,200
if you wanted it to be um

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
off the record for whatever reason but

313
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
if it's a sensitive issue that when

314
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
names need to be named because things

315
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
are moving slow or something like that

316
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,720
we can we can have the ability to do

317
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,200
this even as part of this meeting

318
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,799
and i talked over somebody from remote

319
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
so

320
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,080
yeah no i i think you said it well uh

321
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
lars i mean

322
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
obviously we should avoid having too

323
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
many um

324
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,240
[Music]

325
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
meetings off the record in fact none

326
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,880
would be a very nice number

327
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
um so

328
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
but if there are you know personnel

329
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
issues we're allowed we are allowed to

330
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
meet an executive session for that but

331
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,159
let's

332
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,080
hopefully aim to

333
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,799
to not have to a have too many meetings

334
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
i don't want to

335
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,159
you know this should be a pretty

336
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
focused task in most cases

337
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
and i just assume have the you know one

338
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
group of meetings not multiple groups of

339
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
meetings

340
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
yeah i just wanted to i mean it's the

341
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
same people saying okay it's the same

342
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
answer right no matter which meeting

343
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
and i think this question about how to

344
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
separate policy from operational stuff

345
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
that any anyway something that we need

346
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,760
to learn

347
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,679
um how to handle that so like if we if

348
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,799
we figure out any point of time it

349
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,080
doesn't work we can find a different

350
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
solution

351
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,440
yeah that makes sense so let's get

352
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
started and and if it doesn't work then

353
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
we'll figure out how to fix it but it

354
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,919
seems like it should work then

355
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
all right so basically meeting uh once

356
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,200
during the itf

357
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
slot tbd usually probably breakfast or

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,480
lunch and then

359
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
additional meetings online as

360
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,520
as needed

361
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,799
i guess we won't be able to actually

362
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,600
find a fixed slot on sunday or something

363
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,640
right

364
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
which would make scheduling easier

365
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,799
sunday is completely full

366
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,440
so but we could try to get a fixed slot

367
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,240
one of the mornings or whatever

368
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,450
[Music]

369
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
i i i do want to raise one issue which

370
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,280
is um

371
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,320
that the rsap meeting as it is open um

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
and it is not part of the ietf if people

373
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
want to attend remotely

374
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,039
um that they should be able to do so

375
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
without having to pay a fee

376
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,760
cindy did people had to register to join

377
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,919
this meet echo okay okay

378
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,720
yeah we should figure out a solution but

379
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,080
that's a tooling issue i think

380
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,240
are they attending remotely or just

381
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
observing remotely because the latter is

382
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,559
easier to arrange

383
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
both because elliot and and colin are

384
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
attending remotely because they are

385
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,799
ourself members and everybody else is

386
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,679
observing remotely

387
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,200
and it is possible that we would have

388
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,919
invited um peter saint andre

389
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
uh to present um from the arsoc but

390
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
as he said in the chat he's not paying

391
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,760
the the one-day fee just to do that

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,039
point of view cindy we could just

393
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,400
schedule this as an interim right it

394
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
doesn't have to be part of the ietf

395
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,799
meeting

396
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
um

397
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,559
maybe it we could

398
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
i we would need to play around with that

399
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,600
peter should be able to join us here

400
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
because i just sent him a comp code

401
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
because there was an explicit thing for

402
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
him so

403
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
that one was taken care of no but that

404
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
that's a good point ellie we should for

405
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
meetings during the itf week we need to

406
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,320
figure out how people can attend this

407
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
meeting or observe this meeting without

408
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
needing to pay the fee and an apologies

409
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,880
that um we didn't for this

410
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
instance because we moved this year so

411
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
uh

412
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,679
on short notice and then it fell through

413
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
the cracks um so sorry about that and if

414
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,279
any of you paid just to be here and not

415
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,880
for anything else in the itf let us know

416
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
and we'll figure something out more

417
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,200
generally does the fee waiver cover that

418
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,559
if you ever would cover it but you're

419
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,840
not allowed to say that because you're

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,200
an observer

421
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,240
sorry

422
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,200
also

423
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
can i interject there's been a request

424
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
in the chat for some of the observers

425
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
are having a hard time knowing who is

426
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
speaking in the room so if people could

427
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
identify themselves before they speak

428
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,799
that would be helpful

429
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,080
um this is cindy by the way

430
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,480
sharepoint this is lars

431
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,440
pete

432
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,400
uh

433
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,799
a question uh

434
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,640
since rswg is not formally part of ietf

435
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
we had planned on meeting ietf weeks but

436
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,240
is it somehow separate and therefore

437
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
other members of the community who do

438
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,640
not pay an ietf registration fee would

439
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
be

440
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,000
permitted to go to that meeting as if we

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,720
check in the first place

442
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
i i would think for remote attendance we

443
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,559
should probably get the same setup that

444
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,440
people don't have to uh register but for

445
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,640
in person

446
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,080
for personal attendance like they're

447
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,320
actually at the itm

448
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,400
i will let you all

449
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
figure out the appropriate way to handle

450
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
that it didn't even occur to me because

451
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,440
of course i'm registering for ietf

452
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,039
anyway but

453
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,400
that's probably something that should be

454
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
dealt with i would assume that the set

455
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,279
of people that

456
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,840
would come to an in-person meeting only

457
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,080
to go to rsap or to for observation and

458
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,279
maybe to rsw is probably pretty small

459
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
and we can say that if that ever happens

460
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,480
they should contact us and we'll figure

461
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,600
something out

462
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
individually but i think the default

463
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
assumption is that if you want to

464
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
observe here in person during an itf

465
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
meeting or

466
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,159
attend rswg in person you're registering

467
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
for the itf in some way

468
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
yeah i think it's also fair because they

469
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
are here they're using the facilities

470
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
and the food and whatever so they can as

471
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
well pay

472
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,480
i guess this is eric um

473
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,240
i mean

474
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
when you say register you mean pay a fee

475
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,840
yes

476
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,720
well because people so so i i assume

477
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,600
nobody will come just for rswg no but if

478
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
you attended virtually you might yes so

479
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,039
this is only about in-person virtual i

480
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
think we're gonna try and work out a way

481
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
to observe rsap and participate in rswg

482
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,240
without paying five

483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
okay

484
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,600
actually as we're talking about the

485
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
in-person

486
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,480
uh meeting and it's not on the agenda

487
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
but the question that also came up was

488
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
like do we want to um do anything at the

489
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
plenary from this group do we want

490
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
somebody

491
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,880
to

492
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,480
speak at the plenary usually or

493
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,399
not by default i would say

494
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,600
only if there's something to report and

495
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,120
the only thing we could report this time

496
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,200
is re-met for the first time which seems

497
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
i can put it in my slide deck or

498
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
something but it's it i i have a slide

499
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,679
okay so fine um

500
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,960
but yeah so if

501
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,720
anything ever needs to sort of go to

502
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
plenary level we can do that and also i

503
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,399
guess if something needs to go to itf

504
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,760
announce

505
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,279
that that can happen right either from

506
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,640
the rsap or the rswg it'll happen like

507
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
via somebody who has posting rights

508
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
or speaking rights for the plenary

509
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
but by default i don't think we need to

510
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
have a report or something like that i

511
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
mean the whoever is a chair should have

512
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,240
uh posting and speaking right

513
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,760
the chair of this group

514
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,360
at the end

515
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
which probably brings us to the next

516
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
point yes or they can just tell sydney

517
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,559
to post for them but anyway yeah

518
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,240
right so meeting schedule we we settled

519
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
and we found some some wrinkles

520
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
regarding in person we figured out what

521
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,320
to do about registration okay

522
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,439
chair selection

523
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
so arseb needs a chair do you want to

524
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
try and do that today do you want to how

525
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
do you want to do that is the question

526
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
i think we should try to do this today

527
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
uh because that was one of the main

528
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
reasons for having this meeting

529
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,039
um

530
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
remind me if the rfc says anything about

531
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,039
who's qualified to be this year does it

532
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,000
need to be one of the stream

533
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,880
representatives or

534
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,960
let me look real quick okay maybe

535
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,399
elliott remembers off the top of his

536
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,399
head or something i don't i'm looking

537
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
too

538
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
okay

539
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,320
well there's there would be jay there

540
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,640
would be the rce there's other

541
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
members on the rsap that

542
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,760
so well they're they're ex-officio

543
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,159
members but what the rfc said it just

544
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,399
says the r-sub shall annually choose a

545
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,080
chair from among its members using a

546
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
method of its choosing

547
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,799
okay so theoretically it could be uh

548
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,320
others but i guess realistically it

549
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,840
would be one of the stream owners is

550
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
there any do we have a volunteer from

551
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,679
among the stream representatives to

552
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,360
serve as a chair and

553
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
um mary and i chatted and because

554
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,840
there's a rollover at least for the

555
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
for oh but there's a potential rover for

556
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,080
the iab representative and for the isg

557
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,159
representative but after

558
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,320
every non-com cycle and so i guess we're

559
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
going to have to do this sort of as an

560
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
annual thing after the norm comes

561
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,799
elections settle

562
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
in case the rsap chair is one of the

563
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,200
ones that are

564
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
cycling right

565
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,799
so

566
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,000
obviously

567
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,559
roll over in much along with the

568
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,640
with the potential leadership rollovers

569
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,519
right

570
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
yes it's not only the numcom it's also

571
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,679
just the iab and the iehd could decide

572
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
to just select a different

573
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,960
representative

574
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,480
in march

575
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,559
correct yeah that's true

576
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,600
all right but amongst the current

577
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
representatives is there anybody who

578
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
would like to volunteer to share the

579
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,080
arsenal

580
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
i'd be happy to do it until march that's

581
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,679
nine months that's something i can

582
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,000

618
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,399
doing

619
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,279
um

620
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,840
two things that we wanted to make you

621
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,840
folks aware of as you're getting started

622
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,600
um i'll actually switch the order here i

623
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
think so one is

624
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
uh john levine has been

625
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
serving as temporary rfc series project

626
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
manager

627
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,279
and

628
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,760
we don't have the rsce yet the

629
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
consulting editor

630
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,000
although we're working on the selection

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,640
process there so someone's going to need

632
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,399
to oversee john's work we know how much

633
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,480
of a loose cannon he is no i'm just

634
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,919
joking um

635
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
and uh you know there needs to be some

636
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,440
sort of

637
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
um

638
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
management of that role and i don't know

639
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
you know someone's got to choose when

640
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,679
his

641
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,919
his term will end hopefully after the

642
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,919
rsce is chosen so there's some help with

643
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,039
some

644
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,120
you know handovers there and so on so i

645
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
just wanted to make the uh

646
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,480
the our sab aware of that need

647
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
um related to that is this work

648
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,760
that the change management team has been

649
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,240
doing so john serves on that team this

650
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,719
team was authorized at one point by the

651
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,239
rsoc

652
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,639
and basically works through these

653
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
day-to-day issues that come up there are

654
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,199
tooling issues there are

655
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,960
uh you know things that are

656
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
authors request to do things a little

657
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,239
bit differently there's bugs in the

658
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,679
in the code somewhere that come up and

659
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,079
i don't really foresee

660
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,480
the rsab um

661
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
you know doing this on a day-to-day

662
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,760
basis because

663
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,239
a lot of this is not does not rise to

664
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
the policy level now maybe someone

665
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,119
especi especially once we have an rsce

666
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,839
should be paying attention to this

667
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,199
because things will bubble up out of

668
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
that that need to get

669
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,239
shuffled off to the rswg

670
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,399
but on a day-to-day basis stuff just

671
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,400
comes up and we meet every two weeks to

672
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,359
try to

673
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,040
work through issues that come up in the

674
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
publication process and

675
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
i don't know if this team would continue

676
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,560
if the rsab wants to form a subcommittee

677
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,119
you know how you want to do this i have

678
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,440
no preference but someone's going to

679
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,320
help

680
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,880
work through the day-to-day issues with

681
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,240
the rpc currently that's me john levine

682
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,200
as the project manager me was in my role

683
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,040
as the arsoc chair

684
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,240
um

685
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,040
robert and kasara from the tools team

686
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,839
and allison sandy from rpc and we just

687
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,920
talked through stuff that comes up we

688
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,680
also at some point we're working through

689
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,240
a large backlog of issues that had come

690
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,400
up over time with rfc 7991 bis that john

691
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,280
was working through um you know i think

692
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,440
that's work will probably get sent off

693
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
to rswg at some point once that group is

694
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,359
formed and up and running that's up to

695
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,720
the chairs of that group how they want

696
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,320
to handle that but the day-to-day stuff

697
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,079
that comes up someone's got to be paying

698
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,839
attention and i just want to make you

699
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,000
folks aware of that as um as the

700
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
outgoing or stock chair

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
thank you

702
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
um a couple of questions peter and i i

703
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,599
think i asked you all of them already

704
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,680
but i don't know the answer

705
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,240
um so this uh this team right that was

706
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,920
as he just said it was initially set up

707
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
because there was a big backlog and it

708
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,839
wasn't necessarily uh supposed to be

709
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,839
there permanently but what you're saying

710
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,920
is this has proven to be useful and you

711
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
would like to keep it on a permanent

712
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
basis

713
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,040
not necessarily what i'm saying is that

714
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240
stuff comes up all the time

715
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
a lot of this is tooling related there's

716
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,800
a new version of weezy print which is

717
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
you know the pdf

718
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,119
converter that we use and

719
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:43,920
you know

720
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
there's some do we when do we want to

721
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
switch to that and so on so i think some

722
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,880
of those issues could be worked out

723
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
between rpc

724
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
and the tools team folks to

725
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
about you know xml to rfc things that

726
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,520
are that are happening and wheezy print

727
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
and so on down the line

728
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
um

729
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,079
there are things that come up sort of

730
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,079
day-to-day publication issues well you

731
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,480
know what how are we going to handle uh

732
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
you know mono space fonts in pdf files

733
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
and stuff like that and it's been

734
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,680
helpful i believe and sandy can speak to

735
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,200
this more directly but i think it's been

736
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,680
helpful for the rpc to have someone to

737
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,040
bounce these things around with now

738
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
and then the other thing that comes up

739
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,880
is well some of these start to

740
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,440
are they procedural issues for the rpc

741
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,920
are they policy issues could they be

742
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,599
policy issues could they have policy

743
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,960
implications

744
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
those need to bubble up probably to the

745
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,400
rsab

746
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
how that meant what the mechanism is for

747
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
that is not clear to me

748
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,240
but i know that we have found it

749
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,040
valuable to be able to talk frequently

750
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,800
to try to work through stuff that comes

751
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
up during the publication process with

752
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,960
authors

753
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,720
and uh

754
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,480
the second question is like what's your

755
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,640
commitment here um are you

756
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,880
would you be available to be still

757
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,839
involved or what's the

758
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
plan uh well i'd have no fit no official

759
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,320
capacity anymore uh because i'm no

760
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,680
longer the chair of our stock because

761
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
our second has gone away

762
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,680
i'm not a special person i don't think

763
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
that you know i necessarily need to be

764
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,280
involved in these sorts of uh work but i

765
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
think someone needs to do this and and

766
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,079
it could be that uh you know once the

767
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,720
rsce is seated that that person can sit

768
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,119
on that you know help out with those

769
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,960
conversations i don't know

770
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
i'm not sure who needs to do that

771
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,720
speaking personally

772
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,040
um you know i've sort of gotten out of

773
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,520
the tech industry and i'm starting a

774
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
company with my wife

775
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,760
and uh you know this is not really a

776
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,079
high priority for me if asked if require

777
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,079
if you know if people want me to serve i

778
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,760
can continue to do that for a while and

779
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
i would be happy to do that but i'm

780
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,839
completely volunteer basis now because

781
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,520
i'm focused elsewhere

782
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
no i was always mainly asking because

783
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,880
then kind of the remaining people at

784
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,280
some point john levine uh will step down

785
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,560
but he might be around with his

786
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,079
expertise i don't know but the remaining

787
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,680
people are basically the rpc and the

788
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
tooltip tools team right

789
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
right

790
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,320
okay and as i say i think the rsce

791
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
someone's got to be paying attention to

792
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,960
to help triage what's policy stuff that

793
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,920
needs to get handed off to the rswg and

794
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,560
what's not and i personally as i have

795
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,760
noted via email i do not want the rswg

796
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,359
although i'm not you know a chair of

797
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,960
that group i don't think it would be

798
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,119
productive for the rswg to become a

799
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,599
center of micromanagement excellence and

800
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
get involved in every last little jot

801
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,599
and tittle of the publication process

802
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,280
are we going to dot our eyes and cross

803
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
our t's and use the monospace font here

804
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,119
versus this font there

805
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,880
those are publication issues to me and

806
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,800
procedural issues and implementation

807
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
issues and i don't do not think it would

808
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,520
be productive for the rslwg in for many

809
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
respects to be

810
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,720
you know

811
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
getting involved at that level of detail

812
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
because things will just grind to a halt

813
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,160
and we still need to get the rfcs

814
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
published but again i'm not necessarily

815
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,359
planning to be deeply involved in rswg

816
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,839
either so this is up to peyton and eric

817
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,359
and and other folks who are involved

818
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,280
there but i think personally we need

819
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
some sort of team sort of

820
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,119
work through these day-to-day issues

821
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,800
very much you know procedural

822
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
operational issues that come up during

823
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,720
publication process so that we keep the

824
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
rfcs flowing which is the primary goal

825
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
here of course and do that with quality

826
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,480
thank you

827
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,160
yeah elliott i'm going through the queue

828
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
i have a proposal but we go through the

829
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
queue first so you're first

830
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,319
okay so um thank you

831
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,079
uh and thank you peter and i i must

832
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,599
disagree with you on one particular

833
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,560
point peter you are special um

834
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,359
but

835
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,040
maybe not for the reasons that you were

836
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,119
saying um

837
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,640
a uh

838
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,240
a couple of points

839
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,760
uh first of all

840
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,800
um clearly the day-to-day

841
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,880
stuff has to continue

842
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,599
to

843
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
to function

844
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,960
right and um there's no reason why

845
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,000
uh

846
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,640
the expertise shouldn't be drawn upon

847
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,680
uh for um

848
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,160
uh you know that that the rpc needs to

849
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,599
to function

850
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,040
uh the way

851
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,160
that this was envisioned i think is like

852
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,680
my view of the document that we just

853
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,599
created that peter you were

854
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,000
the the editor of the way i think this

855
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
was viewed was that

856
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,720
indeed uh the rswg should not be

857
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,480
involved in the minutia i love the way

858
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,680
you put it the

859
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,760
the center of micromanage excellence

860
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
that's not their goal

861
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
or their role

862
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,280
in general it's also not the rsab's role

863
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
right that's that's not what we should

864
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,599
be doing either

865
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,359
but that doesn't mean there isn't a need

866
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,319
for

867
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
operational discussion so

868
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,880
um to that end

869
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,960
right my proposal the way this was

870
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,520
envisioned i think was that the llc

871
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,440
would draw upon the expertise that they

872
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
need

873
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
to do the day-to-day job so my

874
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
suggestion is that the llc

875
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,480
you know jay and the rpc

876
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,040
bring together the res the experts that

877
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
they need

878
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,480
uh to do the day-to-day job and and i'm

879
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,079
sure that the people on

880
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,560
people on both the rsap some of the

881
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
people in the rswg

882
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,920
some of the people on a tooling team

883
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
will be very happy

884
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,240
to um to contribute to that effort so

885
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
that things keep moving and if you have

886
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,720
a need a reasonable mix of people

887
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,880
they'll also help the uh identify to the

888
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
rpc

889
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,720
when the rsab or the rswg really does

890
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,440
need to be consulted on something

891
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,760
thank you

892
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
a quick question clarification question

893
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,280
elliot

894
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,599
um when you say that the llc should you

895
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,839
know own this in some form

896
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,680
do you specifically mean

897
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,800
the the

898
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
take on the role that the rfc xml style

899
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,560
guide change management team has been

900
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,040
doing or do you also mean the oversight

901
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
over john levine

902
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,599
um well the

903
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,760
oversight over over the

904
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,960
i guess we should talk about both of

905
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,920
those

906
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,119
um so

907
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,359
actually i meant neither

908
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,200
as it turns out what i meant was

909
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
day-to-day

910
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,079
um decision making whether it has to do

911
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
with xml and style guide or whatever the

912
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,280
case may be whatever day-to-day help the

913
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,119
rpc needs they should organize

914
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,280
themselves to get that help

915
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
right with with whatever assistance the

916
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,440
llc needs to bring to the table and with

917
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,200
whatever you know

918
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,960
and of course they can consult you know

919
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,319
whoever they want to consult and bring

920
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,000
in whoever they want to bring in in

921
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,280
order to manage the day-to-day

922
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,400
activities

923
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
that was the division of labor now

924
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,520
regarding so so that would include

925
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,560
whatever xml style guide issues

926
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,119
there are but it also include anything

927
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,960
else that the rpc thinks that they need

928
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,839
to address

929
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,400
right

930
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
the john issue

931
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,160
um i think that's mostly a j

932
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
issue and again in the case of the

933
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,359
executive director he can bring in

934
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,520
the people that he needs in order to

935
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,839
provide whatever guidance he needs to

936
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
establish you know

937
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,680
you know how john's doing when the

938
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,599
contract needs to end if it needs to be

939
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,440
extended how you know

940
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,359
and and how the transition to the rsce

941
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,200
occurs i don't think the rsap needs to

942
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
be involved formally at that point but

943
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,079
again jay can bring in whoever he needs

944
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,680
for this purpose

945
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,280
does that make sense lars

946
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,880
it makes sense that the i mean the

947
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,400
contracting side of course jay is going

948
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,760
to deal with that right that's i think

949
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
we're mostly talking about the the

950
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,079
content of the work the technical part

951
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,319
and at least i would expect part of the

952
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,000
community to sort of

953
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,319
maybe be a bit nervous about the llc or

954
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,000
jay

955
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,160
doing that part i'm fine with if we

956
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,599
agree that that's a good thing to do but

957
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,839
i i imagine

958
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,640
um

959
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,079
you could make an argument that you know

960
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,480
jade shouldn't like set direction like

961
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
that

962
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,400
like for example what the xml look like

963
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,359
i mean as long as it's within a policy

964
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,560
of if if there's a policy violation

965
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
somewhere along the way

966
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
that's an issue

967
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
right but if we haven't specified the

968
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,839
policy and the rswg hasn't specified the

969
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,359
policy um i don't know that we have a

970
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,000
formal role

971
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
um

972
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,880
i i i think elliot said a lot of what i

973
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,599
was going to say it it's not clear to me

974
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,319
what a lot of the day-to-day things uh

975
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,240
are anything other than operational that

976
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,839
should just be handled by the

977
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,079
combination of the rpc and the tools

978
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,359
team

979
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,440
uh obviously things bubble up to the

980
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,280
policy level the rsap needs to be

981
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,520
involved or the rswg needs to be

982
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
involved but and perhaps not not

983
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,079
understanding what what needs

984
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,960
broader insight

985
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,960
uh i mean perhaps i could provide a

986
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,280
little bit of clarification for on that

987
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,640
um

988
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,839
first of all

989
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,599
we've been in a little bit of an

990
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,520
interregnum here because we haven't had

991
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,280
the rsce

992
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,079
and um or the rsce and we've been and

993
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,400
the the this change management team has

994
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
been kind of

995
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
a little bit of a stop gap and

996
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,599
not pursuing anything that is remotely

997
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,599
policy related because we've been

998
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,440
waiting for the new

999
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,599
structure to go into place

1000
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,000
um

1001
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,960
the things that come up are

1002
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,359
look most things are already handled by

1003
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,200
existing policies right

1004
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,400
and

1005
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,520
the rswg is now thankfully here to

1006
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,359
handle policy things

1007
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,319
um

1008
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,359
if we had some sort of team

1009
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,079
involving tools team members in the rsce

1010
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,119
let's say

1011
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
and before that whoever needs to be

1012
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,040
there to try to help work through these

1013
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,920
day-to-day issues

1014
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
it perhaps would be helpful for me to

1015
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,000
point to some of the minutes because

1016
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,760
this group does keep minutes about

1017
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
what's been going on

1018
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,520
but you can see the sorts of issues that

1019
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,640
come up

1020
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,680
this this group is very conservative

1021
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,800
about

1022
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,200
anything that would potentially impinge

1023
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,640
upon policy

1024
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,200
and has not been working on those things

1025
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,520
and has been delaying but of course the

1026
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,920
rfcs need to continue to flow

1027
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,240
um

1028
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,119
so most things are already handled by

1029
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,800
existing policies

1030
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,599
but uh you know style guide issues and

1031
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,800
and so on

1032
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,839
um

1033
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,520
i don't have examples off the top of my

1034
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,880
head about what some of the things are

1035
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,240
that we've talked about but we've been

1036
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,720
meeting every two weeks for you know two

1037
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,160
years or something like that so there's

1038
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,000
a large large number of kinds of things

1039
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,599
that we've been dealing with but those

1040
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,319
are like these are implementation issues

1041
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,040
i do not see these being policy issues

1042
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,960
and like i say the group is very

1043
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
conservative about anything that is

1044
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,880
remotely policy related it's going to

1045
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,359
get bubbled up to someone and

1046
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,960
once envisioned in the rfc and in 9280

1047
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,800
is that

1048
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,400
you know someone's going to work through

1049
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,079
these things but if anything seems to be

1050
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,720
policy related our sab is someone from

1051
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,000
our sam

1052
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
more than likely maybe the rce at some

1053
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,480
point is going to say hey you know this

1054
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,839
is something that we really ought to

1055
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,160
raise over in the rswg

1056
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,480
and that was the transmission belt the

1057
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,359
mechanism that was envisioned in 9280 to

1058
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,599
try to get these things handled but the

1059
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,520
the implementation issues

1060
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,280
uh you know

1061
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,880
i'll give you an example so there we

1062
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,160
have these things called we have the

1063
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,720
source code element in xml

1064
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,160
and

1065
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,760
there's new people are always wanting to

1066
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,079
have new kinds of source code things oh

1067
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,559
well these are now you know

1068
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,359
python code or whatever and do we add

1069
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,800
things to the list

1070
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,280
uh of the source code types and does

1071
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,359
this one seem like it's a good idea to

1072
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,599
be added and this sort of thing

1073
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,040
these are day-to-day implementation

1074
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,359
issues and i'm just concerned that a the

1075
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,440
rsab does not want to be involved in

1076
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,200
this kind of stuff and i don't see these

1077
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,160
things being rswg issues on a day-to-day

1078
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,640
basis now if the rswg says we really

1079
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,079
think there ought to be an idea i had a

1080
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,640
registry for all these source code types

1081
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,000
yeah you know maybe that's something

1082
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,440
that gets pursued and then there's some

1083
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,200
sort of defined process for adding these

1084
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,640
things i don't know right those that's

1085
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,319
more of a policy issue but the

1086
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,160
day-to-day stuff

1087
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,920
it's going to be a waste of time for the

1088
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,760
rsap to be paying attention to this

1089
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,160
every day

1090
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,960
oh

1091
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,200
so so i mean i generally agree with

1092
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,119
peter's substandard statement but i

1093
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,800
think procedurally it's wrong

1094
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,319
um procedurally the rsab and

1095
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,599
other people have precisely the power

1096
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,920
9280 gives them and no more

1097
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,960
and so

1098
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,800
um they sent to which these things are

1099
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,559
they're not charged to do this then what

1100
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,160
has to happen is the rsw has to publish

1101
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,520
a document enabling to do this and in

1102
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,200
the meantime nothing happens

1103
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,920
and that's like you know i'm sure there

1104
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,319
are small things that have to be decided

1105
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,400
and it must be and rfcs will stop if

1106
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,920
those don't happen but there are very

1107
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,200
few of them and what actually these are

1108
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,319
talking these are things are minor

1109
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,760
enhancements to the system and can

1110
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,720
simply be

1111
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,920
blocked until the process is great for

1112
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
dealing with them so the fact that like

1113
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,680
someone wants to do something and that

1114
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,520
they there's too trivial for rwg handled

1115
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,359
does not empower the rsa to handle it

1116
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,319
nor does it empower um you know the rsc

1117
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,119
to handle it

1118
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,240
do you still have a comment because i

1119
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,079
want to make a proposal

1120
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
uh yeah so

1121
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,319
i'm sorry

1122
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,920
so i i think i actually do agree with

1123
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,280
echo right because the rsap was

1124
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,960
specifically set up to be the approval

1125
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,559
body only

1126
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,319
right and so basically it's it's

1127
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,000
questionable whether we can just take on

1128
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,119
projects

1129
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,079
um

1130
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,760
independently of getting a mandate from

1131
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
rswg

1132
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,440
right so i think if if there's a desire

1133
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
that these functions be homed here we

1134
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,440
need to be

1135
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,599
specifically allowed to do that because

1136
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,200
at the moment we're only supposed to

1137
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,839
approve things coming from the rswg not

1138
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,480
only so there is something um in the rc

1139
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,319
saying that like there is

1140
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,640
if we detect the need for a policy

1141
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,760
we should give it into the um rswg but

1142
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
in the meantime we can make a decision

1143
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,240
so things can move on right

1144
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,760
right my point is that there that

1145
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,200
there's a difference between a need for

1146
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,880
a policy and someone wants to add a new

1147
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,720
source code type which simply is not

1148
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,079
needed and we know it's not needed

1149
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:24,960
because we've gotten this far without

1150
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,160
doing it so

1151
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,319
like my point is like i don't want i

1152
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,480
don't want minor enhancements to shade

1153
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
into need for a policy

1154
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,200
yeah yeah

1155
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,760
so um let me let me make my proposal so

1156
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,480
i think um what we have here is so

1157
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,079
currently the situation is that this

1158
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,240
team is chartered by rsoc

1159
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
um but i don't think that's the right

1160
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,440
setup

1161
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,599
but the rpc is of course they are free

1162
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,599
to meet with whoever they want to meet

1163
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,680
to make things running and i think with

1164
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,240
the publication of the model 3 basically

1165
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,640
all these operational things went over

1166
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,440
to like full responsibility of the rpc

1167
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,359
so i think the rpc should decide if they

1168
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,880
want to keep the team like that and

1169
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,520
manage that team and if the rpc wants to

1170
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,440
have a liaison from this group to this

1171
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,599
team um just to make sure that we are

1172
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,680
i'm able to detect any policy issues and

1173
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,359
bring them up here correctly we can do

1174
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,079
that

1175
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,839
but i think the the responsibility

1176
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,760
should sit with the rpc not the llc the

1177
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,599
rpc because that's where the operational

1178
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,440
decisions have to be made now

1179
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,680
so i like that proposal

1180
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,480
sandy do you like it too

1181
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,520
um

1182
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,359
i think that makes sense but just to

1183
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,280
give a little more context here on some

1184
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,359
of the operational things

1185
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,839
so we're not xml experts right in

1186
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,640
particular vocabulary um so some of the

1187
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,800
things that come up are

1188
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,880
um is this a bug is it a vocab does a

1189
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,960
vocab does the vocabulary need to be

1190
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,000
fixed

1191
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
um

1192
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
can we use the vocabulary in this way

1193
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
right because you can you do workarounds

1194
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,319
for many things right and so we don't

1195
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,400
want to use something incorrectly um

1196
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
and or

1197
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,920
so these kinds of things come up

1198
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,400
somewhat regularly um

1199
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,000
and i could imagine us talking to the

1200
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,440
tools team and

1201
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,480
and john

1202
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,640
for now right and and that being

1203
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,839
sufficient

1204
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:16,960
um

1205
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,000
and if

1206
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,359
something falls outside of that then

1207
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,480
we'll figure out what to do from there

1208
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,240
that sounds good to me my proposal was

1209
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,319
exactly like that you actually organized

1210
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,680
this meeting in a way that you have the

1211
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,800
right

1212
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,960
expertise that you need in the meeting

1213
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,559
you reach out to the right people and

1214
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,480
get them in the meeting if you need any

1215
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,200
support i'm happy to help but it should

1216
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,880
be your responsibility at the end how

1217
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,440
you want to organize this meeting

1218
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,800
elliot you're in the queue still

1219
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,920
yes so um

1220
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,800
two things uh first i agree with the

1221
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,319
proposal

1222
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,240
um i just wanna

1223
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,880
so let me actually let me separate these

1224
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,839
let me just say i agree with the

1225
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,680
proposal when we finish that i have an

1226
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,078
additional comment

1227
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,559
um actually and then there's a second

1228
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,720
point about how to handle oversight for

1229
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,800
um john in the meantime and like i would

1230
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,400
i wouldn't be too

1231
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,839
too formal about this i would just

1232
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,760
propose to invite john to our meetings

1233
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,079
um as long as as is he's around in this

1234
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,119
position

1235
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,720
and we can chat about whatever is needed

1236
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,078
to be chatted about that's it

1237
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,240
i think we're talking about an interim

1238
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,240
time of like a couple of months probably

1239
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,000
so

1240
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,960
yeah i mean as i understand it john is

1241
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,760
uh

1242
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,200
he will be stepping down once we've

1243
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
appointed the new rsce so it's a

1244
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,200
relatively short timeframe i don't think

1245
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,079
we need to do anything for that

1246
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,079
um

1247
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,319
yeah i i would agree that the uh the rpc

1248
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,680
should have a responsibility for the

1249
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,240
rest and talk to whoever they they feel

1250
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,558
they need to

1251
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,920
john does both of this work for you

1252
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,240
um i i

1253
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,760
i think so i mean i think a lot

1254
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,720
i mean

1255
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,240
there's been a whole lot of stuff over

1256
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,440
the past couple of years that we

1257
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,040
basically put on the shelf sort of

1258
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
waiting for someone to be in charge i

1259
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,720
mean which i would summarize as saying

1260
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,119
the way xml what what xml the rfc

1261
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,880
actually does is quite different from

1262
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
what the rfcs say

1263
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,240
and there's a there's a there's a great

1264
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,079
deal of work involved in reconciling you

1265
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,760
know either up fixing

1266
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,280
fixing the code or fixing the

1267
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,480
documentation

1268
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,480
to make them work and and going back and

1269
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,480
reviewing things where neither is quite

1270
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,040
right you know and so

1271
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,559
i think i know more about that than

1272
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,079
anybody else at this point you know so a

1273
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,440
certain amount of this is simply dumping

1274
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,599
dumping in someone in someone else's lap

1275
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,200
but but my guess is

1276
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
since it's impossible for me to dump my

1277
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,640
entire brand at once

1278
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,520
there's also going to be a certain

1279
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,960
amount of overlap just like oh yeah i

1280
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,720
need to tell you about that too

1281
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,079
yeah probably that's a discussion we

1282
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,480
want to have um together with jay or the

1283
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,520
llc and and um the new

1284
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,079
uh rce as soon as this person is around

1285
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,520
so um

1286
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,880
there's definitely more to discuss i

1287
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,359
believe yes

1288
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,880
and the other point is also i don't know

1289
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,799
i mean like um independent of the

1290
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,200
question uh like who makes a decision at

1291
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,880
the end maybe it's actually useful to

1292
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,559
run through these issues at some point

1293
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,640
in just figuring out because you said

1294
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,839
you keep saying that there's a little

1295
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,160
bit of uncertainty about like where any

1296
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,440
kind of these things should be decided

1297
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,280
how they should move forward

1298
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,960
so maybe we could still in this group

1299
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
just like go through the list and figure

1300
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,079
out if we have like a common view about

1301
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,760
how to move forward and not like how to

1302
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,359
move forward but in which

1303
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,720
they need to move forward with with

1304
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,319
certain things is that helpful or would

1305
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,040
that be helpful

1306
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,680
okay

1307
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,160
i'm sorry it was difficult but like

1308
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,599
it really like this group should not be

1309
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,839
setting itself up as back to back to be

1310
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,680
back to be the rsoc which is why fear is

1311
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,599
happening here

1312
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,359
i was proposing this as a one-time

1313
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,359
exercise just like at the at the very

1314
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,520
start so because it it feels to me

1315
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,200
there's there is a certain uncertainty

1316
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,799
and it's just like sure and that

1317
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,359
discussion should happen rsw

1318
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,200
and i think it's just good as a group to

1319
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
have like a common understanding about

1320
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,559
these issues sure and if this is

1321
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,839
entirely a briefing that's fine there's

1322
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:20,880
a decision-making meeting that's

1323
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,040
inappropriate

1324
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,480
i said if that's entirely a briefing

1325
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,760
that is fine but if there's a decision

1326
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,880
making no no so that's what i'm

1327
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,480
proposing i think the only decision we

1328
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,079
want to make is like getting

1329
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,440
understanding where the problem should

1330
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,119
be solved and not finding the solution

1331
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,280
in this case no i mean even determining

1332
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,400
where the problem should be solved is

1333
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,480
not it's not not not a question for this

1334
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,480
body

1335
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,440
it's not it's not a question for this

1336
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
body but i think it's um

1337
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,440
if we if we sit in the same room and we

1338
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,200
all have the same understanding he might

1339
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,040
be right about it if there is a lot of

1340
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,640
disagreement we have to figure out a way

1341
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,480
how to find a solution

1342
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,960
okay so so this is elliott um first of

1343
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,040
all i pretty much agree with what ecker

1344
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,079
is saying

1345
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,839
i mean we have to be a little cautious

1346
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,799
here and my suggestion

1347
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,400
is um

1348
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,240
and it's a suggestion because this body

1349
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,359
has no ability to direct at this point

1350
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,240
um

1351
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,359
it would be really nice if john

1352
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,680
if you were able to lay out these sorts

1353
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,400
of open issues in a summary to the rswg

1354
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,319
and maybe the rswd could invite you to

1355
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,880
do that i mean i'll leave it to eker and

1356
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,000
pete and the rswg to decide that but

1357
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,240
knowing what these sorts of open issues

1358
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,119
are i think is would be helpful

1359
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,480
for the community

1360
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,880
um so that you know if if we think

1361
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,400
everything's going swimmingly and i

1362
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,319
don't mean we just the rsav i mean we as

1363
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,200
the community if we think if we think

1364
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,599
everything's going humanly and you don't

1365
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,160
um we probably want to correct for that

1366
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,799
and um so

1367
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,040
to that end right i think it's great

1368
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,200
that you presented this information

1369
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,400
hopefully

1370
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,359
um the rswg will um invite you to

1371
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,880
present it and you'd be willing to

1372
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,319
present it there

1373
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,720
um maybe even in you know and in what

1374
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,319
form you presented you can negotiate

1375
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,000
with the rswg

1376
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,920
you know personally i like reading stuff

1377
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,480
but other people may feel differently

1378
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,440
right

1379
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,920
um and it's good and and i want to thank

1380
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
you for showing up here and and

1381
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,359
providing a view thank you

1382
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,599
so um i mean i i think we should have

1383
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,880
one sec i want to do a quick time check

1384
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,559
because we have 20 minutes left then we

1385
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,359
have a height cut off at 10 uh to 10

1386
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,799
because the room needs to be set up

1387
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,720
sorry

1388
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,280
950 right um

1389
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,319
what's left on our agenda

1390
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,240
um the

1391
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,480
our process questions but that's not

1392
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,480
urgent and then like anything the rpc

1393
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,400
wants to raise so it's

1394
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,960
do you need time on the agenda yeah so

1395
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,520
can we use five minutes productively for

1396
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
for this topic

1397
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,200
for for the for the one that we're just

1398
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,559
on and then leave 15 minutes for the

1399
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,440
rest

1400
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,040
okay um

1401
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,559
i i want to make one comment so i think

1402
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:03,839
we should just make this work right you

1403
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,280
shouldn't make it overly complicated but

1404
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,280
i think um the way it's defined there is

1405
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,599
actually a role for the asset to be the

1406
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,680
place where the rpc can raise issues and

1407
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,200
then the rsup can provide feedback

1408
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,599
what's policy related and not right so

1409
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,280
having these issues list of issues

1410
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,280
presented here and then go afterwards to

1411
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,720
the um rswg with maybe a smaller list if

1412
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,920
that's possible i think is the right

1413
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,920
process

1414
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,240
right i agree with as long as as long as

1415
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,440
the you know the rpc is asking

1416
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,200
then we have a role the power pc gets

1417
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,880
first crack and i still think it would

1418
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,160
be good for john to to inform the rswg

1419
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,040
about

1420
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,400
the sorts of things that are going on

1421
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,160
but again that's you know elliott's

1422
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,520
personal opinion nothing more

1423
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,160
so i think that the one reason uh why

1424
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,160
it's useful to go the strap step over

1425
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,079
the rsap is because if you if you go to

1426
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,160
the community group people will jump on

1427
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,920
everything right you will not consider

1428
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,520
the question first if this policy are

1429
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,200
not policy related

1430
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
um and it's not like that i want to kind

1431
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,359
of like hide anything there but i want

1432
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,359
to like make sure we have

1433
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,440
uh we don't the discussion doesn't go

1434
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,720
out of control completely from the

1435
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,559
beginning so being a little bit careful

1436
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,839
here might be useful i think

1437
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
mario

1438
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,359
to the chairs of the rswg how they're

1439
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,960
going to handle things but that's a

1440
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,040
that's the chair management issue and a

1441
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,359
working group management issue for eric

1442
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,440
and pete and they're very qualified to

1443
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,960
handle that i think

1444
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,960
definitely and that's a good point so

1445
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,960
when we go through this list i think we

1446
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,319
you both should be invited and be here

1447
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:54,559
okay

1448
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,520
do you want to make an attempt to

1449
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,039
summarize for the minutes what we

1450
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,720
discussed and and

1451
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,799
maybe decided

1452
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,520
um yes so what my understanding is and

1453
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
let's start with um with the second

1454
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,520
point here first that we just invite

1455
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,000
john for the time being um to join our

1456
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,319
meetings and raise any kind of issues um

1457
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,559
that might come up and therefore thereby

1458
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,760
fulfill

1459
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,039
at least kind of informally this

1460
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,079
oversight um role

1461
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:20,280
and

1462
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,240
[Music]

1463
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,079
we also discussed that any kind of

1464
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,960
brain dump john wants to make

1465
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,440
we go through this group as a first step

1466
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,520
and then decide about how to move on

1467
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
next meeting probably

1468
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,160
um and then for the change management

1469
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,240
team um i think we will officially kind

1470
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,680
of resolve this team at this point

1471
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,960
because that was chartered by um arsoc

1472
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,720
but the rpc can start a new team and

1473
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
we are happy to

1474
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,720
send the news all to that team if you

1475
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,279
would like that

1476
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,119
okay

1477
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,760
anything else i think that was

1478
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,599
that matched my uh view of what we had

1479
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,359
talked about thank you okay do you want

1480
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,079
to

1481
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,280
move to the next agenda item

1482
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,079
document approval

1483
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,079
we don't necessarily need to talk about

1484
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,280
this for a long time because there isn't

1485
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,119
any any documents yet

1486
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:23,990
i

1487
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,200
[Music]

1488
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,760
hope we won't see a level of documents

1489
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,440
that would require us to have data

1490
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,440
tracker support in place

1491
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,079
um so i think we can maybe do it uh by

1492
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,520
email

1493
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,680
um

1494
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,599
so um i don't know did you did you

1495
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,280
invite robert to the meeting at the end

1496
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,039
robert is online

1497
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,520
perfect um because like my understanding

1498
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,119
was that actually kind of setting up

1499
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,119
this thing similar to like other groups

1500
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,039
is like probably not a lot of effort and

1501
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
like if we can just have it we probably

1502
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,240
should just do it also for transparency

1503
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,160
reasons in the data tracker

1504
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,839
but

1505
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,200
robert i might want to provide an input

1506
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,520
yes please

1507
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,400
so it is on my plan to add balloting and

1508
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,880
i do think that you're going to need it

1509
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,359
because the uh one of the things that i

1510
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,680
think are going to come through rswg

1511
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,038
that are going to require

1512
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,760
careful analysis for approval are the

1513
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,359
updates to the documents that define the

1514
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:26,520
the grammar and the rendering formats

1515
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,799
what's your um

1516
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,880
view on the level of average required to

1517
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,240
get this tooling done are we talking

1518
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,279
minutes days weeks

1519
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,160
it's not weeks it's

1520
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,520
maybe a day i part we we

1521
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,920
did the bulk of the work when we added

1522
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,440
balloting to the irtf to the i the irsg

1523
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,720
um and i want to the the only reason

1524
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,119
this isn't just um

1525
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,359
half a day's work is i want to refactor

1526
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,960
that a little bit to um

1527
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,440
improve the

1528
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,799
the the quality of the code that is

1529
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,640
supporting the ballots but really this

1530
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,720
is a this is a day or a day or two

1531
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,920
effort

1532
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,400
okay so so that is uh great to hear i

1533
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
think then let's use the data tracker

1534
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,200
since we have it

1535
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,000
um

1536
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
and my feeling is we we could probably

1537
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,760
if we have this in place by 115 that'll

1538
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,520
be soon enough right we don't need it

1539
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,280
any sooner than that i don't expect the

1540
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,240
rswg to have anything to approve for us

1541
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,520
before 115.

1542
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,720
yeah probably not so you have some time

1543
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,359
you can prioritize it accordingly

1544
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,000
thanks robert

1545
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,359
so i mean the other thing um is

1546
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,359
i think also just for the

1547
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,920
um for the purposes of visibility it's

1548
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,440
good to have this in the data tracker

1549
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,200
from the beginning rather rather than

1550
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,599
have some things

1551
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,119
hidden in an email discussion which

1552
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,799
tends to get lost and isn't very visible

1553
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,038
to the community

1554
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,960
yep

1555
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,720
um the other thing is is like how we

1556
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,720
want to handle the balloting in

1557
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,160
process itself

1558
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,599
um and i think we should because like

1559
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,440
there's not many documents to expect so

1560
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,039
i think we should just try to actually

1561
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,119
handle those documents very quickly

1562
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,000
and i would propose um that as soon as

1563
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,240
we get a request we just get like have

1564
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,359
like a

1565
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,200
one week deadline or whatever you can

1566
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,400
discuss that

1567
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,480
um to get the ballots in

1568
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,640
and probably we can also um do this by

1569
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,720
email except there is

1570
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,160
a perceived need for a discussion and

1571
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,079
then we have to quickly schedule

1572
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,680
a call

1573
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,000
um can anybody remind me if the rfc says

1574
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,440
anything about how we're supposed to

1575
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,520
approve do all rsap members need a

1576
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,440
ballot for something to pass or can

1577
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,880
there be

1578
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,319
vacancies on the ballot because people

1579
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,160
take vacations and stuff

1580
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,720
um pete is looking this up first

1581
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,640
but like my memory i agree with one week

1582
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,079
but it might like lead to practical

1583
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,520
difficulties right especially during the

1584
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,119
summer period or something so i think

1585
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,920
all have to balance um

1586
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,160
and i think there's even a deadline

1587
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,920
in the

1588
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,160
draft something like four weeks maybe

1589
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,599
actually

1590
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,599
this consultation as well is that

1591
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,920
separate to this balancing process

1592
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,640
oh right i forgot this yeah oops okay

1593
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,839
then forget what i proposed

1594
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,480
i mean if it sounds like it sounds like

1595
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,960
we should perhaps uh you know the tools

1596
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,640
team should perhaps go through and

1597
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,119
figure out a suggested process and how

1598
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,240
it can be

1599
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,839
reflected into the data tracker and then

1600
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,599
we can check that it makes it matches

1601
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,359
what's in the rfc

1602
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,720
because there might be multiple stages

1603
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,240
if you want to collect collect review

1604
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,839
feedback before paletting for example

1605
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,720
yeah um

1606
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,279
yeah please

1607
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,520
it does not say that all of you need to

1608
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,480
ballot

1609
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,440
um it simply says that the members are

1610
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,039
expected to participate in the

1611
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,440
discussions and and

1612
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,960
and then are

1613
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,839
asked to ballot and if there is still a

1614
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,359
concern outstanding then three people

1615
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,720
voting yes

1616
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,200
approves

1617
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,280
but yeah i think i think um

1618
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
um robert s you're going to look at this

1619
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,799
this document pretty pretty uh

1620
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,679
in detail over the next couple weeks uh

1621
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:22,560
maybe

1622
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,399
propose a way how would you support how

1623
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,120
you would support the process in the rfc

1624
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,920
with tooling and we'll discuss it then

1625
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,679
in a future meeting

1626
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,759
it's not only the tooling it's also for

1627
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,560
example and like i forgot this community

1628
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,120
feedback step but it's also the question

1629
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,799
can we kind of when we get a publication

1630
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,560
process can we just go immediately into

1631
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,238
community feedback or do we need to do

1632
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,278
our reviews first

1633
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,600
where do we send community feedback is

1634
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,759
that a per document decision or do we

1635
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,679
have like a basic set that we usually

1636
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,319
send this to

1637
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,359
so i would propose we use last call

1638
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,198
since that's the mailing list that we

1639
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,439
have i think there is a minimum set

1640
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,359
defined in the irc but we could always

1641
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,439
decide to send it to more lists

1642
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,799
correct correct the minimum

1643
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,600
the minimum is rfc interest

1644
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,120
yeah um but as far as i can tell you or

1645
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,799
is your judgment where descended beyond

1646
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,198
rc interest okay and i would suggest we

1647
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,719
parallelize our review with the

1648
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,560
community review

1649
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,640
so i mean if you look at the isd process

1650
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,238
usually there's first an ad review and

1651
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:30,560
then you go into ietf last call right so

1652
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,839
i'm wondering if we want anything like

1653
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,359
that so

1654
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,640
for the isg

1655
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,719
it makes sense because typically

1656
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,799
the isg hasn't seen the documents before

1657
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,799
they hit the isg an error director might

1658
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,719
have right but here the rsa people are

1659
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,960
supposed to participate in the rswg

1660
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,040
basically continuously right so we

1661
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,319
should already know what's in those

1662
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,198
documents before they get to us

1663
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,760
and so i i think you know parallelizing

1664
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,360
the community last call review

1665
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,560
consultation whatever you want to call

1666
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,480
it and our review

1667
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,640
seems doable and might save some time so

1668
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,360
i

1669
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,960
let me say one more thing and i i think

1670
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,640
i agree with you but so what i did in my

1671
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,560
ad reviews usually is like checking kind

1672
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,800
of some of the formal stuff like is the

1673
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,719
again are the a and a considerations

1674
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,480
correct or whatever because it's good to

1675
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,400
catch these things before community

1676
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,719
review

1677
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,040
correct but as i said right we should we

1678
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,159
should already know what's in those

1679
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,000
documents yeah you but that's not about

1680
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,600
the content it's about kind of formal

1681
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,880
things that are missing somewhere that

1682
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,400
you actually have to like look and read

1683
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,000
at the details but i don't think that

1684
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,239
there might be many of these issues and

1685
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,840
and if these issues come up we can still

1686
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
change what we want to do

1687
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,600
so you're saying you want to do

1688
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,679
an internal rsap

1689
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:40,880
review

1690
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,280
by some rsap members first

1691
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,800
and then go to

1692
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,480
community review i'm not sure if i'm

1693
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,640
proposing that but one way would be to

1694
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,040
kind of assign an rsap shepard or

1695
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,800
whatever and that shepherd then decides

1696
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,480
that the document is ready for external

1697
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,360
review

1698
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,679
yes okay um just this is elliot

1699
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:02,400
um elliot

1700
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,920
can we take pete quickly and then we go

1701
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,920
through the rest of the queue

1702
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,800
so

1703
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,280
this is pete i i just want to read you

1704
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,960
what 9280 says about this because i this

1705
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,960
doesn't quite track with what you're

1706
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,840
saying

1707
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,239
so once consensus is established in the

1708
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,000
rswg

1709
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,320
and that all happens the rsab shall

1710
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,600
issue community uh call for comments

1711
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,360
if substantial comments are received in

1712
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,719
response to community call for comments

1713
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,199
the rsab may return the proposal to the

1714
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,640
rswg

1715
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,640
to consider these comments

1716
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,440
and

1717
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,239
make revisions

1718
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,040
in parallel with the community call for

1719
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,520
comments the rsab itself shall also

1720
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,000
consider the proposal

1721
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,600
if the scope of the revisions made in

1722
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,120
the previous step is substantial an

1723
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,960
additional community call

1724
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,600
will be made

1725
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,760
once the

1726
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,600
rswg chairs confirm that the concerns

1727
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,760
received during the community calls for

1728
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,440
comments have been addressed they shall

1729
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,600
inform the rsab that the document is

1730
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,520
ready for balloting by the rsab

1731
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,199
so in effect

1732
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,440
that sounds like ecker and i make the

1733
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,120
call on whether

1734
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,640
we're done

1735
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,640
so you all can make comments to us

1736
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,560
during that period you can evaluate the

1737
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,480
document the community can make those

1738
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,760
comments we evaluate we're done then you

1739
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,440
go to balloting

1740
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,199
this group is starting the community

1741
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,239
call right

1742
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,960
you start the community call and if

1743
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,640
there's significant changes you can

1744
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,600
start another one right but then we as

1745
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,400
the

1746
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,800
wg chairs make the call that it's ready

1747
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,199
for ballot then you go so this might

1748
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,880
mean that there's a bit more work for

1749
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,719
robert because i don't think any other

1750
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,760
balloting has this ping pong thing uh

1751
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,880
but

1752
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,480
um

1753
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,560
i think the since we have eight minutes

1754
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,560
left i think the proposal is for robert

1755
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,400
and the tools team to look uh take a

1756
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,679
look at the rfc

1757
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,480
propose a uh tool-supported

1758
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,960
balloting approach that that implements

1759
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,760
what the rfc says and and

1760
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,600
presented here for

1761
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,920
consideration and probably also in rswg

1762
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,960
rs

1763
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,920
rswg because they have a role as well

1764
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,360
so eric and colin you've been in the

1765
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,000
queue but not anymore

1766
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,520
yeah i just wanted to add one quick

1767
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,600
comment about the timing

1768
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,679
right which is in terms of the amount of

1769
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,440
time it takes to ballot

1770
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,320
uh

1771
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,360
you know the

1772
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,360
the program actually looked at that and

1773
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,640
i think there were

1774
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,080
there were various versions that

1775
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,640
discussed how long things would take the

1776
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,440
only reason there isn't a specific time

1777
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,760
in in there is because maybe some

1778
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,840
proposals require a bit more

1779
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,760
consultation

1780
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,080
within the streams so if something's

1781
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,320
going to make have a major impact on the

1782
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,880
ietf for instance

1783
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,600
then it may be that the the rsap member

1784
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,840
wants to consult colleagues

1785
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,440
to get views and in fact the

1786
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,120
it's even possible for the streams to

1787
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
establish policies around this

1788
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,960
but let's not abuse the notion of

1789
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,840
reasonable time in terms of how long it

1790
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,600
takes to ballot

1791
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,000
and um also i just want to note that

1792
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,920
there's sort of several rounds of

1793
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,679
potential balloting

1794
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,920
right so the first round

1795
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,280
is you know yes concern whatever and if

1796
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,920
the concerns aren't resolved right

1797
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,600
it's possible

1798
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,080
that that balloting will change

1799
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,080
and that's that's the intent of the

1800
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,640
concern is that concerns get addressed

1801
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,840
and hopefully by the end there are no

1802
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,199
concerns

1803
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,480
um

1804
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,360
but it may take uh several rounds of

1805
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,360
back and forth in order to address that

1806
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,600
again the way this was envisioned was

1807
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,600
that the rsap members shouldn't surprise

1808
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,400
anybody where possible and

1809
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,920
uh that this should come up you know

1810
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,560
during the rswg wherever possible

1811
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,880
um but when that doesn't happen

1812
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,000
um probably some negotiations will occur

1813
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,400
in in order to try and resolve concerns

1814
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,480
and i just want to mention that that

1815
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,440
that level of it it's very similar to a

1816
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,440
discuss in that way

1817
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,120
um that eventually they're meant to be

1818
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,719
cleared but after some period of time

1819
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,800
you just you know you just count heads

1820
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,080
okay we have five minutes and i think we

1821
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,320
want to move on to the next i want to

1822
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,520
give colin a chance if he wants to

1823
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,840
comment

1824
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,199
uh no i i had nothing i just can't

1825
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,960
explain i i actually i think i want to

1826
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,640
propose now that we assign an rsub

1827
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,159
shepherd to every document because it's

1828
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,520
also we need i think we need one

1829
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,960
dedicated person to follow up with the

1830
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,560
comments and just who feels responsible

1831
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,719
to move the document forward

1832
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,800
um but i think you're right that we need

1833
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,320
some kind of protocol um not protocol

1834
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,480
tools back from robert and then we can

1835
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,199
keep

1836
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,719
move on with the discussion so robert

1837
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,960
are you able to write something down or

1838
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,800
do you need more support at this point

1839
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,159
no i don't need more support

1840
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,000
robert had some networking problems

1841
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,480
early i don't know if he's back he

1842
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
he said no right

1843
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,199
i couldn't hear anything okay then we

1844
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,400
just wait for your input thank you

1845
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,199
all right rpc sandy anything

1846
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,440
excellent you're saving us some time

1847
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,719
that is great

1848
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,159
um

1849
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,159
but let me say one thing um please feel

1850
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,679
free when you have any issues to just

1851
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,040
send them to the main list or put them

1852
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,199
directly on the agenda this is really

1853
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,839
just to help you

1854
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,679
is there anything else cindy

1855
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,600
do we have any other business i think

1856
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,679
pete had a point that we can maybe do in

1857
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,040
four minutes

1858
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,560
i hope so

1859
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,360
uh a dumb one but one that has to be

1860
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,679
dealt with ecker and i were preparing

1861
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,679
slides for rswg

1862
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,679
and realized that we

1863
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,520
stuck the note well on as per the

1864
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,360
template and read the note well and went

1865
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,719
oh crap

1866
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,040
um that note well says lots of things

1867
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,000
about the ietf which this group is not

1868
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,520
part of

1869
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,520
i would be happy to get a recommendation

1870
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,440
from you all about what we should say in

1871
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,560
there

1872
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,880
or whether we should rip it out or

1873
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,159
because

1874
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,560
officially we're following the ietf

1875
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,040
anti-harassment policy we're following

1876
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,400
the ietf ipr policy because all

1877
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,199
documents that are drafts submitted are

1878
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,120
going to have to have the appropriate

1879
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,600
copyright templates on them

1880
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,040
someone files a patent in rswg i don't

1881
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,120
know what we're going to do

1882
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,080
but

1883
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,760
we probably should have something at the

1884
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,440
top of the slides

1885
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,199
i don't think either of us care what it

1886
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,040
is but there's

1887
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,640
we would take recommendations on what

1888
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,840
the right thing to do here is

1889
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,920
as you say i think it does apply um but

1890
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,440
i think you just want to remove the word

1891
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,080
itf here and then use the same text but

1892
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,520
it might also be just a question for the

1893
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,360
group itself

1894
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,199
yeah i mean this is a problem we have in

1895
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,760
the the irtf as well and for the

1896
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,679
notewell and the ipr we have a statement

1897
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,000
that the policy applies substituting

1898
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,360
iatf you know irtf i etf throughout but

1899
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,159
i'm not convinced that works very well

1900
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,120
um and i'm hesitant to suggest reopening

1901
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,840
the uh ipr rfcs but reopening them and

1902
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,440
just doing the textual search and

1903
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,800
replace

1904
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,400
uh might not be a terrible thing to

1905
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,480
clarify them but yeah this is something

1906
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,880
we need to work out for the irtf as well

1907
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,840
as the rswpg so

1908
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,120
this is elliott the uh rfc actually

1909
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,280
speaks to this

1910
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,800
um the first sentence of section 3.1.1.2

1911
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,719
says all interested individuals are

1912
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,040
welcome to participate in the rswg

1913
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,199
participants are subject to the

1914
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,360
anti-harassment policies described in

1915
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,159
section 3.2.5

1916
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,120
and those are present in

1917
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,679
you can then see the policy

1918
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,000
stated in section 3.2.5 where it says

1919
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,159
the ietf anti-harassment policy applies

1920
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,840
to the rswg

1921
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,000
and rsap and so that's what you can

1922
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,800
include on your slides

1923
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,400
the same thing with the irtf which is

1924
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,280
the

1925
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,600
the iotf documents say something similar

1926
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,360
and then you go read the anti-harassment

1927
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,880
policy and it says it only applies to

1928
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,280
the ietf

1929
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,360
um and uh similarly for the the ipr

1930
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,360
statements and so on again you know

1931
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,679
the irtf and presumably the rswg

1932
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,440
documents say they apply and then if you

1933
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,400
read the

1934
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,960
actual rfc it only talks about atf so

1935
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,400
there's some clarifications that might

1936
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,880
be needed so i think there are two

1937
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,800
questions what the rfcs want to say and

1938
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,520
what these slides ought to say um

1939
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,239
so

1940
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,679
i'm looking at the slides there appear

1941
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,600
to be three categories of material

1942
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,120
there's the anti-harassment policy which

1943
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,960
i think we've effectively whatever the

1944
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,040
documents like specifically say we've

1945
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,400
patched them so that they say the itf

1946
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,600
and your hospital policy applies so we

1947
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,040
can put that in just fine

1948
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,080
then there is the ipr policies which

1949
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,880
9280 is silent on regrettably and then

1950
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,560
there are any policies that are involved

1951
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,320
preceding the meeting at all like giving

1952
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,920
your like the part about you know

1953
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,040
acknowledging their making a

1954
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,320
photographic record and personal

1955
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,159
information you give the itf and i think

1956
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,600
those should remain the way they are

1957
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,800
because you actually can't come to this

1958
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,000
meeting right now without participating

1959
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,480
in the itf and so like as a practical

1960
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,679
matter that those are the rules

1961
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,960
regardless of whether or not like

1962
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,280
whatever around 280 says so

1963
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,120
my inclination is to

1964
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,880
do some light editing on this and remove

1965
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,639
the ipr section because i personally

1966
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,560
just right now does not apply at all

1967
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,840
because an oversight 9280 but

1968
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,199
nevertheless is the state of play can't

1969
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,120
remove the ipr section because working

1970
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,600
the rswg will happen via internet drafts

1971
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,440
and they are submitted under offline

1972
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,719
like pcp

1973
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:39,920
that may be true but doesn't mean their

1974
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,520
statements in the microphone are subject

1975
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,199
to it i agree this is an oversight i'm

1976
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,840
just trying to do

1977
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,360
it's not only the documents it's like

1978
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,679
any comments made to an air director at

1979
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,080
a microphone or in an itf setting fall

1980
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,440
under the node well and air directors

1981
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,320
will be

1982
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,440
in that room

1983
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,280
so it's it's

1984
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,880
not having the ipr policy apply will

1985
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,960
just make it very confusing

1986
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,400
so are people suggesting i should not

1987
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,880
edit this will slide essentially at all

1988
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,719
i didn't catch that are you suggesting i

1989
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,080
not edit the slide essentially at all

1990
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,520
which certainly is i think

1991
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,960
i would suggest that the full node well

1992
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,400
applies

1993
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,159
why don't we throw this slide as it is

1994
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,000
and then we'll we'll put up an agenda

1995
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,239
item to adjust for the working workers

1996
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,520
if they wish to i think that's the right

1997
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,120
thing to do but i think i also agreed to

1998
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
last like if you are at an itf meeting

1999
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,960
it actually applies and if you have an

2000
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,560
interview which is outside of the itf

2001
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,679
meeting it might be different but i

2002
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,800
think you don't want to tweet that

2003
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,840
differently

2004
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,040
i agree subsequently i'm just trying to

2005
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,520
figure out what the text actually says

2006
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,719
and we're one minute over uh

2007
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,560
thank you all

2008
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,880
yes special thanks to arsoc for your

2009
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,280
service and everybody who's serving in

2010
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,719
future in this setup

2011
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,960
see you at rswg

2012
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,960
dispatch

2013
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,760
