join the queue and we'll go back and

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,079
forth based on the queue as opposed to

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,839
who's physically in the room

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
with that we'll go ahead and get started

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
so we have a pretty

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
this is an official ietf meeting

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
the

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
notewell

42
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,318
that you've been seeing in other

43
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
meetings this week does apply

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
so now somebody that's remote needs to

45
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
mute

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
great thank you

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
so the note well applies a couple other

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
things if you are

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
in the room the

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
ietf

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
is requesting that everybody wear

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
masks unless you're speaking at a

53
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,200
microphone

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
and

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,599
if you get close enough sometimes that

56
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,839
you can keep the masks on even for that

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
the

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
i think that's uh

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
scribe then you're going to take notes

60
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
right theater excellent

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
there is if you join the notepad that's

62
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,760
linked off of data tracker you can

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
contribute to the notes as we go along

64
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,200
uh we find that doing this

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
online helps us get our minutes done in

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,519
a much more timely manner

67
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
i know that i personally am responsible

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
for several sets of late minutes so

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
that way we have a record of at least

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,040
what we have so feel free to contribute

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,159
to the minutes as we go

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,130
the

73
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,680
[Music]

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159

77
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,879
in particular

78
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
there's the be sure to sign up which

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,720
we've already talked about use meat echo

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
to join the mic queue keep your audio

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
and video off if you're not using the

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
on-site if you're using the on-site

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
audio and video off if not using the

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
on-site version

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,439
i don't think that's quite right but

86
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
yeah double negative

87
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,319
yeah

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,280
there's something wrong with that

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,799
sentence

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,560
wear masks i've already talked about

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
remote participants

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,760
uh

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
make sure your audio and video is off

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,879
unless you're sharing or presenting or

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
speaking in the queue feel free to turn

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
on your obviously your audio but

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
definitely your video as well if you

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
wish for the queue

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,478
and use of a headset is strongly

100
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
recommended

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
um

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,519
so here's our agenda for the day

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
uh this is our uh administrative and

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
agenda bashing portion we have a pretty

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
light agenda

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
dieter and i

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
dropped the ball on scheduling our

108
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
virtual interim

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
that we were going to schedule about

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
three or four weeks ago

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
and so we don't have some of the work

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
queued up here for this meeting that we

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
had

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,520
hoped but we do have a few things that

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
we want to go ahead and get moving

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
and then we'll talk about scheduling

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
virtual interims going forward

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
i'm going to

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
preface it with we're we're thinking

120
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,040
about trying to go ahead and have a

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
standing virtual meeting

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
uh every month and that way we can

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
schedule it if we we can cancel it if we

124
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
don't have work to do but we're hoping

125
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
that that'll keep us making some

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,400
progress

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,840
in a more timely manner

128
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,600
um so the

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
is there any agenda bashing any

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960

131
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
shortly on those

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840

a little bit earlier to have a

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
conversation for this this meeting but

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
that last call has been issued

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
i'd really like to remind working group

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840

162
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,520
helpful if people can review and

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,360
comment on the mailing list about the

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
document even if the comment is i think

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
this is ready to be published

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,639
because we need to show

167
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,160
consensus within the working group this

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
is a pretty small working group it

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
always has been a small working group so

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
we need to get that those comments on

171
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
the mailing list in a timely manner

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
uh and then we have two things that are

173
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
waiting on shepard write-ups um

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
the

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
update registries

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,318
there was an update done earlier this

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,880
earlier this week so

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
we agreed that

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
at the last virtual owner and we agreed

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
that the update registries was had

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
passed working group last call and it

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
was ready to pass on to the iesg

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
and dieter did a review of it and he

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,080
asked for a few changes and then the

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
question came up about whether the

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,919
document should be

187
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,319
informational standards track

188
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
the document that it is updating is a

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,199
standards track document

190
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
so we have decided to switch it from

191
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,199
informational to standards track and

192
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,720
we're going to do a very short working

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
group last call on that specific issue

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
before we move it on to the iesg

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
are there any questions or comments on

196
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,199
that particular document and that plan

197
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,360
of action

198
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
nope okay

199
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
uh the next document that we have

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
sitting in our shepard write-up status

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
is the ptp enterprise profile we have

202
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,878
gotten

203
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
approval from the ieee to share the

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
underlying specification for that for

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,479
the purposes of the review of this

206
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,680
document

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,000
we also have um

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,479
updated text

209
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
the there

210
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
there is going to be a terminology issue

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
with this document as we pass it through

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,039
the ietf because it's based on the

213
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
1588 specification

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,919
1588 specification uses

215
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,800
a language that

216
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,479
is

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
will probably be problematic in the

218
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
review

219
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,839
1588 is based on

220
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
the concept of master clocks and slave

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,719
clocks

222
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
1588 has an active par that is

223
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
making progress

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
that will address that issue and so for

225
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
the purposes of forwarding this document

226
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
we will be

227
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
referencing that work

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
um

229
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
and then um

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
and noting that because of the ietf

231
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
document

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
reference

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
is is a representation or a profile of

234
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
the 1588 specification

235
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,600
we will be

236
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,519
using the language that's in the 1588

237
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,000
specific specification with the

238
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
understanding that 1588 is updating that

239
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
language because the the core

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,640
specification is under their their

241
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
change control and our document is a

242
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
profile of that document

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
so with those two issues resolved

244
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,120
we will be progressing that

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,880
so that is any questions on that

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,839
document

247
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
okay

248
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
uh can you

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,839
oh no you can go ahead and come just

250
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,240
stand up

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
hi this is dennis riley from equinix um

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
since i um

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
also am on the 1588 committee and know a

254
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
bit about that um alternative

255
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
terminology

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
draft going forward do i understand

257
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
correctly that the

258
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
the current text still references the

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
old language

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
and we're basically as part of the right

261
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
write up going to say once the

262
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
alternative terminology

263
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,959
amendment

264
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
gets approved

265
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,519
um we'll just change it

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,600
we're not committing to go back and and

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,680
update the document what we're saying is

268
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
that

269
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
uh

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
we're using the the language that exists

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
in the document that

272
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
is currently published we understand

273
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,079
that that language is being updated

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,040
and

275
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
we

276
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
advise people that are implementing this

277
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
to refer to the work of the 1588 to see

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
what the updated language would be

279
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
okay but the text of the draft won't we

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
don't anticipate changing that

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
well i my hope is is that this is going

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
to be published before before

283
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
that

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
before that par is completed

285
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,680
okay

286
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,279
so i mean

287
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,920
we could hold it up but i've i mean this

288
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
document has been held up for a long

289
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,399
time for

290
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
for administrative and

291
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
i mean not not for this issue it's been

292
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
held up for a long time just because we

293
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,160
haven't gotten our act together and

294
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
moved it on okay um

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,880
um i'm just asking so i understand um

296
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
what the implications are going forward

297
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
thank you very much right that's that's

298
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
the plan right now the the thing is is

299
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,160
that depending on how fast the 1588

300
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
stuff gets through and how fast this

301
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
document gets through if

302
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,360
if

303
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
if the timing works out right now the

304
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
timing looks like this will be done

305
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
before that will be done

306
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
so that's the plan right now

307
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
if this gets delayed

308
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
and if the 1588 work picks up speed and

309
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
moves right on through the process

310
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,880
then we can update this document

311
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
and and it is it's even possible to

312
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
update this document

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,240
you know we can update it as at a later

314
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
rfc but you know we would need somebody

315
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
to do the work so i'm not committing to

316
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,639
do that work yet

317
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
all right

318
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
any additional questions on the

319
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,120
enterprise profile work

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
um

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,399
so with that

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
um

323
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
moving back to

324
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
the agenda then the next topic is the

325
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
ntp v5 use cases and requirements

326
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
document

327
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
um james i know you're online did you

328
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,160
want to say anything about that document

329
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
uh yeah i don't actually have a huge

330
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,240
amount to say other than i've published

331
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
a zero zero for the working group and

332
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
really the only change that's been

333
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
included in it is

334
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
uh some editorial uh changes and mints

335
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,639
that paul gear had submitted

336
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
i think in terms of uh what i plan on

337
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
doing now is that i've got about a half

338
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
dozen uh issues and things i think need

339
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,959
to go in

340
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
uh into it such as making references to

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
other documents and clearing up some

342
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,680
bits and pieces

343
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,639
um

344
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
it would be good if the working group

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
could have a review out and

346
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
pick it to bits again and then i think

347
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
in the following interim meetings we'll

348
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,120
i'll have further updates and if there's

349
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
any any normative language that's

350
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,279
particularly sticking we can get

351
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,200
consensus calls from those meetings

352
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,440
okay thank you james

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
are there any uh questions or comments

354
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
on the ntp v5 use cases and requirements

355
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,639
document

356
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
this title speaking uh i have a question

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
there's this security requirements

358
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
document from the tick tock working

359
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
group

360
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
and um

361
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,199
i

362
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,079
just wonder if did you consider the

363
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,519
sweat model which is described in the

364
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,160
in this document

365
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
when you

366
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
formulated your section five of your

367
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
document document

368
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,880
uh

369
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
i did i haven't looked at it yet i

370
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
wasn't aware of it could you send me a

371
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,199
link or something and i can include it

372
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,319
yes that's rc 7384

373
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
yeah that was the requirements document

374
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
that was done uh prior to the

375
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
development of nts and so that would be

376
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
a good one to take a look at

377
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
any other questions or comments on

378
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
on the use cases and requirements

379
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
document

380
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,199
okay

381
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,040
we have already covered the registry

382
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
update draft

383
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
rich you don't have anything else on

384
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
that right we've covered everything we

385
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,199
need on that yep

386
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
um so then we have a list of items where

387
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,399
we haven't had any updates yet

388
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,120
the first one is rough time we had

389
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
optimistically thought we would do a

390
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,759
hackathon effort on rough time

391
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
at this ietf but that didn't get pulled

392
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
together in time we've had no real

393
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
updates to the document does anybody

394
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
have anything

395
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
i'm not even

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,120
is any are any oops

397
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
um

398
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,319
the

399
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
if there's no

400
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,639
i don't believe

401
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
are there any comments or questions on

402
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,638
rough time

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,279
i do think we're interested in getting

404
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
some implementation experiments

405
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
experience on that

406
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,600
we have

407
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,440
a little bit of time to plan for

408
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,519
potential hackathon effort

409
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,839
in conjunction with the ietf 115

410
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
and so we'll take a look for that

411
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,639
the next topic that we've had no updates

412
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
on is ntp v5

413
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
i believe in last

414
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
chatting with marislav the thought was

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,680
that

416
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,279
once we had

417
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
adopted the use case and requirements

418
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
document

419
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
we could

420
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
consider adopting

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
his draft for ntp v5

422
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
marislav do you have any comments on

423
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,160
that document or your plans for

424
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,399
that uh yeah

425
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
i think there was some discussion on the

426
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
mailing list about meeting those

427
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,040
requirements and since

428
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
they

429
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,360
don't seem to have changed significantly

430
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,119
maybe

431
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
we can look at it

432
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,199
again

433
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
i think

434
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,160
most people seem to agree that

435
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,599
the draft

436
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
would meet those requirements but there

437
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,039
are some

438
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,799
issues

439
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
which i

440
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,039
already forgot

441
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,919
that would need to be explained

442
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,600
what

443
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
is exactly meant

444
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
and if this works

445
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
okay uh james go ahead

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
i think i did some analysis based off of

447
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
what doug had provided and i think there

448
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,880
was only three

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
two or three things that were

450
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
outstanding where the requirements

451
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
didn't line up with

452
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,280
uh the draft your draft but i think that

453
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
was against the previous version so

454
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
maybe it would be an idea to just go

455
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,400
through and

456
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
recheck it

457
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
revalidate that and we can we can talk

458
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
about that on the list

459
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,559
okay

460
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
um

461
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
miroslav do you think it's worth doing

462
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
the call for adoption now or would you

463
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,480
rather wait a little longer

464
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
i'm not sure

465
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,600
what do you think it's best

466
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,760
um

467
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,559
i think it probably go ahead and

468
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,600
i think we should go ahead and do the

469
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
call for adoption i mean we've had it

470
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
sitting there for a while

471
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
i'm sort of glancing at the id to see if

472
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
he's giving me a different indication no

473
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
okay

474
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,960
something from

475
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
here

476
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,679
oh no no no

477
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,960
no we don't need anything i think we

478
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
were just

479
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
i mean this is ntp v5 so it i don't see

480
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,799
that we need

481
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,240
i think we should go ahead and get it in

482
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,720
there i think people i think if they

483
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
have the right they use the requirements

484
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
document side by side with the actual

485
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
protocol specification then they'll be

486
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
able to

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,080
do a better

488
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,240
analysis of how the requirements are

489
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
translating into reality so

490
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
go ahead james

491
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,240
so i've dug up uh my old spreadsheet and

492
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
there is five things that are

493
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
outstanding two are

494
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,919
uh unknowns ossification and the three

495
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,240
that were not yet met were

496
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
uh minimizing abuse capability no

497
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
notifications and

498
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,919
uh connection reestablishment

499
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,440
with that i don't think these are

500
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
insurmountable as

501
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,440
do the call for adoption um and we could

502
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
we can work out these

503
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,240
later

504
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
um and use consensus calls to get them

505
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
over the line

506
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
okay i think we'll go ahead and proceed

507
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
with the call for adoption of miroslav's

508
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
document for ntp v5

509
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
and that'll give us something concrete

510
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,840
to work towards

511
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,639
um

512
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
the

513
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,280
ntp over ptp document

514
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
uh

515
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
is

516
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
has been around for a little while

517
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
miroslav do you want to comment on what

518
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,679
the next steps for that are

519
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
i think this one could go

520
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
to the call for adoption

521
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
and there will

522
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
um

523
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
be somewhat needed uh

524
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,559
recently

525
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
i saw some

526
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,880
issues that could be

527
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
related to the

528
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
sequence id in the ptp packet

529
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
and

530
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
the current draft

531
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,440
says it should be always zero but that

532
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,320
might be an issue with some

533
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,039
specific drivers so that would need to

534
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,240
be addressed i think

535
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
okay

536
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,559
i think to get

537
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
uh better eyes on this we should

538
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
probably go ahead and do the call for

539
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,559
adoption on this one as well

540
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
is there anybody who disagrees with that

541
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,120
okay

542
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
uh so the last

543
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,320
uh

544
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
work with no updates is nts for ptp

545
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,840
um

546
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
the status of that work is we had two

547
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
different uh proposals on the table

548
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,159
and those the

549
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
uh primary

550
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,640
advocates of each of those two proposals

551
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
were going to get together and see if

552
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
they could merge those into a single

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
approach

554
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,000
that has not been done yet and um

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
so i think we're

556
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
we're kind of waiting on seeing how the

557
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
primary

558
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
advocates for that work

559
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
end up falling

560
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,080
how that ends up falling out

561
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,520
in the meantime one of the authors is

562
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
finishing up

563
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
a graduate degree so

564
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
this could take a little bit of time

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
um

566
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,559
is there there's i don't see any of the

567
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
primary authors online is is there

568
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,559
anybody here who

569
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,559
can speak to the status of that effort

570
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,840
no

571
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,799
okay

572
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
so that brings us to the end of our

573
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
agenda

574
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,159
so do we have any other updates any out

575
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,280
any other

576
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
business that we wish to

577
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,760
bring up

578
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,679
go ahead marislav

579
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
yeah i would like to ask

580
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
and this might be a bit

581
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,120
controversial for ntp v5 if

582
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,880
if it would make sense to support

583
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
the new time scale

584
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
local time

585
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,840
i've seen some users

586
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,320
using modified ntp

587
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,960
and instead of utc they use local time

588
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
and this

589
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
greatly simplifies the

590
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
client's logic

591
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,600
in some

592
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
small embedded

593
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,559
computers and i was wondering if this is

594
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,360
something that

595
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
should be supported

596
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,559
in ntp 5 or not

597
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
yes

598
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,840
some ideas

599
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
anybody want to

600
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,520
touch that one

601
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,360
uh go ahead james

602
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
uh i would say let's take this one to

603
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
the list it would be good to understand

604
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,600
more about the russian

605
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,480
okay

606
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,799
uh

607
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
dennis

608
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,320
so i think it's definitely something

609
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
that

610
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,880
um we should talk about

611
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,960
it's it's worth discussion discussing

612
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,679
i think we need to understand

613
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,039
all

614
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,400
the different use cases that might be

615
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,360
involved um

616
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,559
i can certainly understand for instance

617
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
wanting to run a bunch of clocks off mtv

618
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,679
ntp and have those clocks show the local

619
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
time but there's more than one way to do

620
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,559
that

621
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,440
um

622
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,919
and i want to elaborate right now but um

623
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,279
it's definitely worth discussing in the

624
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,520
context of ntbb5 things like

625
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
do we never

626
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,480
do we ever want to

627
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
transmit the time on the wire in a

628
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
different time scale or is it sufficient

629
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,960
to just include some fields that tell

630
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
end devices

631
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,080
what the local time is

632
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
um

633
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,640
there are a lot of things we can do it's

634
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,440
worth discussing

635
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
i guess that's it

636
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,120
yeah um

637
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,880
i saw somebody pop into the queue and

638
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
then back out is there anybody else that

639
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,919
wanted to comment on this topic

640
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,520
oh okay

641
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,279
so

642
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,360
miroslav if you could start an email

643
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
thread

644
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
on the ntp mailing list with the subject

645
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,480
line that clearly caught people's

646
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,919
attention that this is what we were

647
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
talking about you know something like

648
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,440
alternative time scale for ntp

649
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,120
um

650
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,360
then we could have the discussion there

651
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,918
is that okay

652
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
okay thanks

653
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
all right

654
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,840
any other business

655
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
okay so to uh

656
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
wrap up

657
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
we do plan as i mentioned earlier we

658
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,840
plan to try to do

659
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,400
a virtual interim once a month

660
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
moving forward

661
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,600
i think we need to look towards a rough

662
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,960
time

663
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
hackathon effort

664
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
in november

665
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
um

666
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
and

667
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
based on how the next few months worth

668
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,960
of

669
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,440
of um

670
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
virtual meetings go

671
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,080
we will decide whether or not to request

672
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,039
agenda time for ietf 115 or not

673
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,559
i think one of the keys is that this

674
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
agenda time is pretty valuable

675
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
and so i know that i personally feel

676
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,159
really guilty about having a 30-minute

677
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,039
meeting

678
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,679
in a two-hour time slot here

679
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,720
so

680
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
um

681
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,880
any other business

682
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
with that everybody have a lovely day

683
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
thank you

684
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,918
oh wait hold on a second

685
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,840
i don't know that we have the right

686
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,200
people in the room to answer the

687
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
question is do people want to meet at

688
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
115

689
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
and i guess the ques my concern is

690
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
there's a number of regular participants

691
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
who are not here

692
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
so i'd rather ask that question i feel

693
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,120
like we

694
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
we didn't tee up enough conversations to

695
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
attack attract the people that normally

696
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,159
participate

697
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
uh and then the other thing that that

698
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,559
happened was we scheduled i didn't even

699
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,399
think of the conflict

700
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,360
but

701
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
we are exactly

702
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
conflicting with the ieee 1588 plenary

703
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,240
which happens once a month at 10 a.m on

704
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,919
wednesdays

705
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,480
and um so and a couple of some of our

706
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,840
virtual participants are also

707
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,360
there so um

708
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
if i paid more attention to the it's

709
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,039
only like once a month it just so

710
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,480
happens you know what's the chances

711
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
um

712
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
so that that was a a schedule conflict

713
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
that was unfortunate

714
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,399
um

715
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
so with that are the is there any other

716
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,440
business

717
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,679
and we as as i said we'll decide about

718
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,240
115 in a couple months once once we see

719
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,039
if we're getting a fair amount of work

720
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,360
towards some

721
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
progress on these drafts

722
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,279
thank you everybody and have a good day

723
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,760
oh

724
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,200
um

725
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,080
20 versus 24-bit

726
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,918
actual like code inconsistency

727
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,918
might um weird

728
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
uh

729
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,120
