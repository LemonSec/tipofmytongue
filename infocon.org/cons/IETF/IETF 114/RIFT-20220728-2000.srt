welcome to the rift working group in IHF

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,760
114

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,620

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
processes and policies I'll just read

34
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,940
that line everything else

35
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,379
just re

36
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,780
you should be already familiar with it

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,019
already

38
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
some reminders

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,300

also please use the on-site tool even if

42
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,019
you don't plan to speak at the mic

43
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,200
that is the the way to to sign the blue

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,659
sheet today these days

45
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,599
you can do that you can to use the

46
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,879
answer to either

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,000
either follow the link in the agenda or

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,019
scan the QR code

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,620
so Jeff do you want to take

50
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,420
from here so

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,580
agenda for today we are going to provide

52
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,260
quick update also with regards to

53
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,140
rechartering and work you would like to

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,540
progress and then Jordan is going to

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,040
talk about updates to the base spec uh

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,580
and Delta VPN KB registry I think we

57
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,739
reached good consensus with Ayanna Fox

58
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,939
here

59
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,840
and the assistant recharging discussion

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,439
website

61
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,040
so uh

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
Alvar thanks for your review it came

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,239
back so we are working on it

64
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,519
applicability statement is still pending

65
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
uh it is review

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,639
young models yesterday submitted to isg

67
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,000
KV registry as we said British consensus

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,160
with Ayana and now we need Shepherd

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,600
right up and uh Rift segment routing has

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
been adopted as a new working group

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,520
document

72
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,820
so um then the next presentation is from

73
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,340
Jordan head let me just download the

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,179
material

75
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,280
foreign

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,039
okay uh

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,740
so pretty big change or at least there

78
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,300
will be pretty big upcoming changes for

79
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,160
the uh the base spec

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,699
um next slide

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,460
so with alvaro's feedback that came back

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,440
um here's you know some of the stuff

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
that's going to come up as um

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,460
the major feedback would be some of the

85
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,560
ASCII diagrams didn't exactly they

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,060
weren't parallel with their SVG

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,500
counterparts um

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,840
now that there aren't requirements for

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,820
things to be exact but they need to be

90
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
at least comparable so that both

91
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,800
are both formats of the document have

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,259
you know roughly the same experience

93
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,060
um things like textual references and

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,979
diagrams and so forth

95
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,520
um other clarifying changes to yeah

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,860
next slide

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,800
uh just a little bit of a visualization

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,020
for those that are interested so um what

99
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,199
I mean by not parallel so the SVG on the

100
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,360
left you know pretty cool and so forth

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,759
but the um the two ASCII versions on the

102
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,880
right the the top is the before and

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,919
the bottom one is is after it you know

104
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,020
more clearly reflects the point of you

105
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,539
know the in this case intertography

106
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,539
inner top of fabric uh rings on the

107
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,780
Fabrics um again the svgs are kind of

108
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,419
more of a should than a should

109
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,360
um but again it's about uh it's an

110
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,699
accessibility thing right the

111
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,560
need to be able to read relatively

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,360
similarly uh next slide

113
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,160
um kind of the same thing right just

114
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,479
there's just some inconsistent labeling

115
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
stuff like that um

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,160
see the SVG on the left in the uh ASCII

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,979
version on the right is

118
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,400
a little more parallel uh

119
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
um yeah one thing that came to mind just

120
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,060
now is that

121
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,979
um

122
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,039
the svgs are of course nicer and and

123
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,680
easier to understand uh if I was reading

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,580
the document

125
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,919
I don't know if we can put a note maybe

126
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,479
especially at the beginning of that

127
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,620
first section

128
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,500
say you know go look at the PDF uh type

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,060
thing because most people are going to

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,340
go look at the HTML version or something

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,080
and they might not get the

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,479
the benefit of looking at and all the

133
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,120
and all the nice pictures

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
yeah I know

135
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,599
um this was when we were first doing the

136
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,180
svgs it came into a whole it was

137
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,919
a whole thing figuring out what was

138
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,419
allowed what wasn't you know grayscale

139
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,280
versus color and so forth we're not

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
actually allowed well

141
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,919
we were uh advised not to

142
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,699
reference specific formats in the text

143
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,800
at all at least that's what I saw

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,560
it ties back to Geneva Convention sort

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,180
of things it's pretty interesting as far

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,680
as accessibility and readability in

147
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,419
certain parts of the world may not have

148
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,160
access to something that could render

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,660
HTML properly things like that but um

150
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,379
yeah so wanted to but

151
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,220
um

152
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,599
okay next slide

153
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
um just kind of other stuff uh there I

154
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,879
know you mentioned the um we should

155
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,440
request early allocation for the

156
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
multicast addresses and the UDP ports

157
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,940
um we'll

158
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,319
I'll make a note to the chairs or I'll

159
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,580
send email to the chairs when we push

160
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,560
version 16.

161
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,379
um you know be on that various editorial

162
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,760
things readability uh Clarity aspects um

163
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,700
some reference fixes and

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,380
I still eat responses so there'll be a

165
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,599
couple of things that will have a little

166
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,679
bit of a discussion about the vast

167
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,240
majority of feedback is

168
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
super straightforward

169
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,760
next slide

170
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,800
um and there's some things unrelated

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
e-review that I kind of noticed

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,580
um so well first off uh

173
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,800
I'll be added as the sixco author

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,360
um thanks for helping me weed through

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
that it'll require a minor Shepherd

176
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,500
update

177
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,200
um but ads mentioned that that's a

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,940
pretty straightforward thing

179
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,440
um

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,160
did some fixes for minor fixes for the

181
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
thrift schema with regard to what's

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
already reflected in the KV draft they

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,019
just

184
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,180
a little bit out of date there

185
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,180
um other SVG fixes just you know

186
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,640
size scale things some of the in the

187
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
previous versions they were they scaled

188
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,260
really really poorly and it was it was

189
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,360
um and

190
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,760
other kind of SVG XML optimization and

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,860
that had to do with there's actually a

192
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,720
three Meg uh

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,140
limit on the draft upload tool that um

194
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,940
cause all sorts of fun problems we had

195
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,680
to render the pdf version and the pdf

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
version doesn't render the svgs very

197
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
well

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
but anyway so that now everything should

199
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,000
kind of fall into and they'll get the

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,760
full benefit like the HTML version

201
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
um I'm going to well we we have a get

202
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,399
issue open with them

203
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,680
but hopefully there won't be pushback so

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,899
I might bug you depending upon things

205
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,720
but um

206
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,300
uh okay next slide I think that's

207
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,700
yeah that's it other questions before

208
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,560
move on

209
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,579
it's pretty straightforward

210
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,160
I don't see a queue so we just continue

211
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,880
the next one

212
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
okay

213
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,500
um just gonna provide a brief update on

214
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
auto flood reflection

215
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
um next slide

216
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
so

217
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,440
just a quick refresher um for those

218
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
aren't familiar it's um

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,700
it's an experimental draft out of LSR

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,560
but the short version of it is

221
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
um so you know there are lots of reasons

222
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,399
to use you know flat single area igps

223
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,140
but they come with drawbacks you know

224
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,540
flooding State convergence right every

225
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,279
node's got I know

226
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,200
hold that state and then compute that

227
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,339
state

228
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,560
so there's a link to the actual flood

229
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,940
reflection draft

230
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,200
um but we'll kind of circle and with

231
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,519
Rift here in a second next slide

232
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,320
um so flood reflection like Rift is very

233
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,240
well suited for cloth apologies um so

234
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,760
Rift will take care of the underlay

235
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,800
um and then the auto FR extensions will

236
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,019
use you know Rift CTP and

237
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,180
the LIE exchanges to build a flood

238
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,160
reflection topology on top of that so

239
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,880
next slide

240
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,720
so where does it actually fit in so

241
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,300
flood reflection requires loopback

242
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,620
addresses

243
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,440
uh system IDs for Isis Network entity

244
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
titles which just makes the single

245
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,940
address and then cluster ID to actually

246
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,360
segment the flood reflection domains

247
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,000
um and so uh Auto FR has to actually

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,740
build and derive those variables using

249
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,720
the distributed State we get in the rift

250
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
so next slide

251
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
so what that really kind of looks like

252
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
is so Z rip CTP will you know it'll

253
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,720
drive each level it'll build the Riff

254
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,600
fabric next slide

255
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,899
uh the the FSM will help derive all of

256
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,940
the flood reflection roles and variables

257
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,760
and you know basically take the what

258
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,380
would be configuration data and then

259
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,300
next slide

260
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,000
and then finally you end up with Isis

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,040
flood reflection on top of everything so

262
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,660
the adjacences has come up you have the

263
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,639
flood Reflections apology and

264
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,500
there you go you basically plug in

265
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,720
everything you have a whole fabric

266
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,240
um okay next slide

267
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,579
so as far as the actual uh work in the

268
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,079
draft so

269
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,560
uh there were some uh concerns with how

270
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
you know

271
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,760
the iso address derivation wasn't very

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,260
clear where it came from unless you went

273
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,120
in and looked at the thrift model it's

274
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,860
there but it should be kind of aligned

275
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,899
in the text as well

276
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,740
um

277
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,980
the kind of did a new section

278
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,500
refactoring of sections for all of the

279
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,480
extensions required

280
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
to Rift so it's like Auto FR works so

281
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
that would be you know the finite State

282
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,560
machine no tie advertisements and kind

283
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,060
of any applicable schema updates

284
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,660
basically prior to kind of refactoring

285
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,519
it felt a little disjointed you have to

286
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,839
bounce around the draft to figure out

287
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,600
what was what was doing what so more

288
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,339
readable now next slide

289
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,839
okay uh we added a flood reflector

290
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,160
preference value which means we need to

291
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,860
update the election procedures to factor

292
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,040
that in and then

293
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,459
the key value ties are more of a

294
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,899
editorial stuff so a little bit of

295
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,820
normative language and kind of

296
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,160
we've since reworked the game graph just

297
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,079
a little bit so we've got the request

298
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,760
criteria aligned

299
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,779
okay so next slide

300
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,740
okay just a little bit of a you know

301
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,300
visual fluff if you will as to how

302
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,980
what's clarified

303
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,480
um so we

304
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,339
those are the functions that are tied to

305
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,440
what are actually in the draft in the

306
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,699
appendix that kind of show you know

307
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,740
here's how we derive it and these are

308
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,120
the you know the individual functions

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,500
that build the parts of the address that

310
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,079
we need so it's that image isn't there

311
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,199
but it's described in text now versus

312
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,579
not

313
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,420
next slide

314
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,540
um right so like I said what what it was

315
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,100
before was with things being so

316
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,959
disjointed um

317
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,000
put everything in a single section and

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,639
said you know here's the

319
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,779
flood reflective version the cluster ID

320
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,720
and the preference values and

321
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,820
um there were a little there's a little

322
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,079
bit of a functional change with that

323
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,959
that wasn't described before to kind of

324
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,680
factor in for interoperability with

325
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,820
nodes that do run it nodes that don't

326
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,220
run it nodes that do support it but

327
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,139
don't want to run it so

328
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,800
next slide

329
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,320
so quick look at the actual reflector

330
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,660
election previously it was just High Sid

331
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,720
low acid second highest second lowest uh

332
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
that's basically to prevent

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,459
you know any single node coming in from

334
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,019
flipping the entire Fabric and killing

335
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,120
all the adjacencies

336
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,680
so we

337
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
it's the same concept all we do is

338
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,860
factor in preference now so it's the

339
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,480
same thing but with highest preference

340
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,300
value and it will cycle through if

341
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,019
you have enough flood reflectors but um

342
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,860
okay next slide

343
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,540
um like I said for key value ties lots

344
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,100
of normative stuff basically we made it

345
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,779
say that you know you don't have to

346
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,480
carry everything but you probably should

347
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,259
um

348
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,839
and then the like I said the actual

349
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,259
request component of it is aligned with

350
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,040
um

351
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
what the key value draft says

352
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,579
next slide

353
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,480
um so that's that's really it uh we are

354
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,040
requesting working group adoption for

355
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,980
that one but we'll add in some

356
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,820
multi-plane considerations I know that's

357
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,040
kind of on a back burner for

358
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,620
that's really just any questions about

359
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,399
autofr

360
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,540
all right so and the option

361
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,240
um it would need to to

362
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,959
probably need the the charter update to

363
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,940
adopt it yeah well that's fair enough

364
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,040
yeah yeah we'll talk about it at the end

365
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,620
thank you

366
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,320
okay

367
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,240
Auto evpn

368
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,019
um

369
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,740
similar to Auto FR but you know build a

370
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,139
European topologies on that but just a

371
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,820
quick update with this one

372
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,399
next slide

373
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,639
uh so kind of similar to the auto F on

374
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,620
these things were um

375
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,360
you know we use this the temple product

376
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
FR and then we notice it problems so the

377
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,459
similar structural changes made things a

378
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,199
lot more clear and readable

379
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,059
um so again it was just feeling

380
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,280
disjointed previously and you know

381
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,099
jumping around the documents never good

382
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,819
um

383
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,119
similar stuff to the auto F4 where the

384
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,559
key value ties as well some Norm to

385
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,299
language things and you know Ayana

386
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,039
things were tightened there was a little

387
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,060
bit of a model change in that

388
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,520
[Music]

389
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,179
um

390
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,280
certain piece well we'll we'll come to

391
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,059
it

392
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,580
uh and then you know editorial and knits

393
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,020
and things like that so next slide

394
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,760
okay um so again just kind of kind of

395
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,500
aligns with what we did with autofr so

396
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,860
the the actual extensions just kind of

397
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,720
more contained where they should be uh

398
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,760
as well as the actual Behavior Uh this

399
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,679
was never really spelled out before um

400
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,299
and that they

401
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,320
uh version fabric ID the auto evpn model

402
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,059
itself

403
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,799
actually has to be advertised in a no

404
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,840
tie at least once in each Direction so

405
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,840
we can again it has to do with interop

406
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,000
and then there were kind of relevance

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,179
complementary scheme updates for that

408
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,200
um yep next slide

409
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,039
okay so with the kit with the key value

410
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,240
ties

411
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,200
um the auto evpn the the Telemetry model

412
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,919
we use to push Upstate Upstream

413
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,539
um had a couple of things in the thrift

414
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,480
model that have now since moved uh

415
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,620
with common

416
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,900
model overall so you know

417
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,059
be used outside of it so it's kind of

418
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,340
just a it's more of a cleanup thing but

419
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,960
it's an important one

420
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,740
um

421
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,360
be

422
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,720
the structure of the that bit in common

423
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,580
Thrift also changes just a little bit

424
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,200
but again that just aligns with the

425
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
values that we're going to request from

426
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,440
Ayanna for

427
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,440
well-known oui and experimental key

428
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,059
types

429
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,860
um again normative language stuff right

430
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,900
don't don't have to do these things but

431
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,039
should

432
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,700
and

433
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,160
um the actual request of it light up

434
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,059
next slide

435
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,960
okay same thing here

436
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,820
um we are still kind of work on some of

437
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,020
the data center interconnect stuff so

438
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,640
it'll basically be a different Auto VPN

439
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,419
model to you know get track

440
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,679
um more multi-plane considerations and

441
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,179
we've got a lot of this stuff built in

442
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,860
already but there's some other

443
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,020
implications we need to work on

444
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,720
um and then some actual operational

445
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
deployment considerations

446
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,960
um next slide and I think that's it

447
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,940
okay

448
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,720
questions there

449
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,380
questions comments

450
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,980
okay we'll move on to the next one then

451
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,600
I miss this one will be fast

452
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,140
so key value structure just need a

453
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,179
little bit of

454
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,580
restructuring so uh next slide

455
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,559
the only slide

456
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,539
um nothing terribly exciting but it's

457
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,100
kind of worthy of an update

458
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,360
um

459
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,340
going through the shepherd View for the

460
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,440
Yang model made me realize that uh this

461
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,559
would not do well so I refactored it to

462
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,880
take into consideration all of the

463
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
Ayanna stuff you know expert review

464
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,320
requirements guidance for them you know

465
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,720
registry structure as well

466
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,419
um so like Jeff said the shepherd

467
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,880
write-up's already in progress there but

468
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
um next slide

469
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,880
so this may be a little bit of a

470
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,200
question for ad depends on what they

471
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
want to do I I sent an email initially

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,740
saying you know

473
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,679
or the Ayanna had reached out to me they

474
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,360
did an early review actually before this

475
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,620
and kind of said well you know you're

476
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,179
you're requesting a registry from

477
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,559
something that isn't there yet there's

478
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,179
no top level Rift category yet because

479
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,220
it's requested in the base spec

480
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,940
[Music]

481
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,720
um

482
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
I was thinking about already just you

483
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,320
know we'll move that request into this

484
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,179
draft but I

485
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,620
changed my mind I don't know if there's

486
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,059
any benefit to it we can just leave it

487
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,679
in the main spec if it's not going to

488
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,880
speed anything up again

489
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,600
yeah

490
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,600
um so the

491
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,840
right sorry I saw your email but I was a

492
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,340
little bit confused because

493
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,120
yes the register doesn't exist they

494
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,740
um they have been doing Ayanna has been

495
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,700
doing

496
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,320
recently I think they started maybe this

497
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
ITF reviewing documents that they see on

498
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
agendas

499
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,700
uh so they probably have never reviewed

500
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,760
the base spec right yeah right so they

501
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,280
don't know that that is coming so yeah

502
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,919
you know they so no I you should just

503
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,380
assume that that exists because in any

504
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,580
case we're going to publish this after

505
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,620
the base spec yeah yeah so by that time

506
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,240
yeah it should be there yeah and I I

507
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,860
talk to you think oh maybe maybe this

508
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,080
move along faster video split in hairs

509
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,780
right so leave it as is I'll correct the

510
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,880
email

511
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,480
the uh but there is I actually have to

512
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,760
specify the rift registry that I'm

513
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,580
requesting out of so

514
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,940
um very brief update to version two but

515
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,100
literally sends yep to me

516
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,320
um Tony P Juniper so that's more

517
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,840
question to Alvaro so do you prefer us

518
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,539
to stick the hole into one huge registry

519
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,600
king of Rift or should we break off the

520
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
rift base spec registry and then the key

521
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,320
values registries

522
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,100
foreign page

523
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,280
for Rift and in there there will be

524
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,580
multiple razors yeah no no problem

525
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,720
okay no and uh that's that's it so um

526
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,740
no that's all I have

527
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,400
okay I think uh thank you that's all the

528
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,240
updates we have uh we just

529
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,140
and zip through the presentations now

530
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,820
it's coming to the

531
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,240
before we go to the next agenda and do

532
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,940
you have any comments questions from

533
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,360
anyone

534
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,700
Tony

535
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,880
uh Tony P again so just as update the

536
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,919
community so Jordan's pushing the newest

537
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,780
version of the draft up because you know

538
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,700
we're basically breaking tools all the

539
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,280
time size wise

540
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,940
um

541
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,360
reviews going on and I am updating

542
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,240
Bruno's open source uh implementation to

543
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
the newest spec which I already did but

544
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
there's one thing that Bruno was

545
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
supposed supposed to do but he's in

546
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
communicanto for a moment so

547
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,980
um uh that will be done within the next

548
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,140
week or two and test it against you know

549
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,240
Juniper implementation so the open

550
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,500
source implementation should be

551
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,419
completely up to date within a week or

552
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,700
two on the newer schema etc etc

553
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,600
thanks

554
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,880
foreign

555
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,240
discussion

556
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,159
So currently Charter has a base spec

557
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,559
applicability setting young model

558
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,860
all documents are in advanced State and

559
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,080
progressing really well

560
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,419
right so we have adopted another number

561
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,240
of items that kind of happen the charter

562
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,659
half not so we would like to update

563
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,020
Charter to explicitly include all the

564
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,720
work on key value registry

565
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,020
and all the work

566
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,000
where

567
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,980
Rift is used really for bootstrapping

568
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,340
stuff so otvpn

569
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,779
flood reflection

570
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,820
so segment routing is uh adopted but

571
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,760
again not exactly in the chapter so I

572
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,400
would like to include it uh multicast

573
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,559
work has been stranded for quite some

574
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,980
time but we plan to restart working

575
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,679
working group potentially after next ATF

576
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,080
and you would like to include the new

577
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,900
Charter as well so it's there when we

578
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,240
start so we don't have any off Charter

579
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,659
work for the couple of accumulative

580
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,140
Tony

581
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,260
yeah so the especially the multicast

582
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,600
um I mean the whole multicast was stuck

583
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,580
on this last issue of the tree joint at

584
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,159
the top right and that was before the

585
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,320
whole Auto VPN autoflot reflection would

586
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,900
actually delivers a completely

587
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,860
distributed stable election at the top

588
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,840
for you know whatever one two three

589
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,220
roots that possibly can be used to

590
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,500
resolve this multicast dilemma in which

591
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,500
the multicast at the end was stuck and

592
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,159
uh I think it's worth a push

593
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,080
if it doesn't you know it's impossible

594
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,380
to solve well I mean no other igp

595
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,659
managed to solve it reasonably if we

596
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,240
manage to actually get these multicast

597
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,980
working and merge it at the top this

598
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,440
will be a pretty big pop in terms of

599
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,059
protocol design

600
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,919
so I just encourage you know more than

601
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,539
happy to have a look and help with the

602
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,580
stuff as well to give you know the one

603
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,260
last look whether we can merge all these

604
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,880
trees that we already figured out at the

605
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,140
very top and get the whole solution

606
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,640
working

607
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
yeah I think there's a unique

608
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,000
opportunity because of characteristics

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,520
of protocol it doesn't only distribution

610
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,799
ability it also allows some

611
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,900
bootstrapping which other protocols

612
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,020
don't do so well so yeah that's the idea

613
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,380
uh

614
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,200
any comments uh Alvarado what do you

615
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,260
think

616
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:21,179
oh sorry you're here uh yeah it would be

617
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,539
really nice if uh others in the working

618
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,659
group uh had opinions uh because you

619
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,480
know it's important to to

620
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,039
um you know get reviews and people to

621
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,919
look at the drafts and everything else

622
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,480
other than that yeah this should looks

623
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,899
good to me

624
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,840
great so we'll send to the list

625
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,700
proposals for update Charter start the

626
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,480
discussion and potentially go on so next

627
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,580
idea we plan to have an updated chart

628
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,000
anyway

629
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,340
and we don't have any more items to

630
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,419
discuss so if no questions here we can

631
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,340
give you back 30 minutes you can spend

632
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,100
something else or maybe think about

633
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,320
multicast in Rift thank you so much

634
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,539
everyone for joining us

635
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,419
