thanks for your patience

6
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
all right i'm gonna go ahead and start

7
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
talking while greg is getting ready to

8
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
share the slides

9
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
to give a little bit of background

10
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
we

11
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
have a

12
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
education mentoring and outreach

13
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,799
directorate some of you are familiar

14
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,560
with it and some of you are

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
are new

16
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
this directorate uh

17
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
has a fairly wide remit at the moment um

18
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,799
and so we wanted to have a open meeting

19
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
uh it was going to be a side meeting and

20
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
then we wanted to allow remote

21
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
participation so we

22
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,279
made it in this particular context so

23
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,479
hopefully everybody can

24
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
figure out where the meeting is

25
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
i do know there's an issue with which

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,120
button you need to push on data tracker

27
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
but it is on data tracker and it is

28
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
available via meet echo

29
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
and anybody that doesn't know that

30
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,520
doesn't know because they're not on me

31
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
echo now but i sent it out to a couple

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
people that asked me individually

33
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880

emo durr and having multiple sessions

88
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,280
during the week and

89
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
not quite being a full

90
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
working group i think and

91
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
me using old

92
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
software

93
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
well no so now the issue we have is uh i

94
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
haven't properly set up my browser on

95
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
that laptop but i know it's set up

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
correctly on this laptop so we are on

97
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
top of things yeah but just one second

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
and i'll start doing the slides you want

99
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
to talk a little bit about the plan

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
before i get the slides up yeah sure um

101
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,639
uh i'm happy to talk through that well

102
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,840
first of all i think we need to say that

103
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
this session is being recorded and

104
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
the note well applies

105
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
so

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
it's super important if you haven't had

107
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
a chance to read it recently i like to

108
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
read at least three times a year just to

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
remind myself

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
uh and things like the uh

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
anti-harassment policy and privacy

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199

113
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
uh that apply to all itf contributions

114
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759

117
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,159
forth so

118
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,958
uh

119
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,760
yeah

120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
take take a moment to read that if you

121
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,479
haven't lately um it's good stuff um

122
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
yeah so uh with that we can talk a

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
little bit about um the overall plan and

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
just uh how we got to here

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
the um

126
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
this group and others have uh worked to

127
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
sort of create an outline of the things

128
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
that we're hoping to get done in this

129
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
in this year

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
and it was the first time i think that

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
we put together

132
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
a shared vision like that so it took a

133
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
little while to get together but now we

134
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,839
have one and i know work has already

135
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,279
begun on

136
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
some components of that

137
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
and as soon as

138
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
karen shares we'll be able to share it

139
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120

173
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
as a quick reminder i wanted to go

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,279
over the emo door plan but greg has

175
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,640
already pretty much done that since

176
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
we're 10 minutes in i think we might

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,279
move on that i did want to um

178
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
just in highlighting this if you look at

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
the plan itself

180
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
maria is working with a group of people

181
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
that are doing some quick start grind

182
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,079
guide activities and so that uh activity

183
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
is partially underway

184
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,920
uh greg is doing a number of the things

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
that are currently listed under

186
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,640
informational materials so if you're

187
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,959
interested in that

188
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
you can speak to him about that

189
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,959
as rich already mentioned rich salsa and

190
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,640
i do the

191
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
working group chairs forum

192
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
we are interested in

193
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
any ideas for topics that should be held

194
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,160
in there and we're also interested in

195
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
any people that are willing to help work

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
and organize that

197
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
um

198
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
online training um

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
this is some training that is being

200
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
produced and greg is working on that and

201
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
i have to admit greg i was working on

202
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
getting my thing up and i don't know if

203
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,120
you spoke about it in any details i did

204
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
not yet excellent uh and then um

205
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
then there's the ietf newcomers program

206
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,480
and we're going to talk a little bit

207
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
about what we did here and what we're

208
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,279
planning for the future um

209
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,600
and michelle and i are working on that

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,079
uh and then we have uh deep dives

211
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,720
tutorials technical presentations and

212
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
right now with the

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
exception of the work by the iesg to

214
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
produce some deep dives

215
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
our tutorial work is uh paused at the

216
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,639
moment so that's also something if

217
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
you're interested in pursuing that would

218
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
be great

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
um

220
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
so at this point in the agenda

221
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
um update on chairs training greg

222
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,320
can i ask a quick question first

223
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
absolutely so

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,760
and maybe you want to answer this as you

225
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
go through other stuff but obviously

226
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,519
greg is you know a paid

227
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,839
uh llc employee

228
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,160
how much of this stuff is

229
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
staff supported stuff with volunteer

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
help versus volunteers have to just kind

231
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
of take this on

232
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
blah blah blah blah blah

233
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,959
some of that is called out in the plan i

234
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
mean if you see

235
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
greg or ams staff listed there then

236
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
obviously that is supported uh if you

237
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,519
see it being led by

238
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,920
uh or you know worked on by us

239
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,639
chances are it has it's not right but i

240
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
think part of what we're looking for uh

241
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,160
is help in identifying

242
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
where it would be best to put those

243
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
resources

244
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
okay so

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
could you be careful because the

246
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
microphone

247
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
sorry uh would you like to speak robert

248
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
asking if you could be careful to be

249
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
close to the microphone you were

250
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,920
speaking yes

251
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
we will turn into the into the mic yes

252
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
we'll we'll do a better job thank you

253
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
robert

254
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,079
um

255
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,959
so it really varies but um i think if

256
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,920
there are

257
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
if there are good ideas that seem

258
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
implementable and we can scope the

259
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
resourcing then there is some resourcing

260
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
available but um i think for 2022 we've

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
you know you'll see the plan and i think

262
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
what we're

263
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
for additional stuff we probably ought

264
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
to think about what we might want to do

265
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
in 2023 and how we should get that

266
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
resource and part of the reason i even

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
asked the question which might apply to

268
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
other folks is

269
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
there's stuff that i would be willing to

270
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
help but not

271
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
have others sort of depend on my help

272
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
existing at all times

273
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
um and if it's a purely volunteer thing

274
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
if i'm not doing the work someone else

275
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
is getting screwed

276
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
whereas if i'm not doing the work and

277
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,040
there's staff involved at least

278
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
someone's getting paid

279
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
which is better right

280
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
um i i really see a lot of improvement i

281
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
think we're we're doing a better job of

282
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
utilizing

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,399
uh

284
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,079
paid resources to help us get the kinds

285
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
of things done that we want to do and we

286
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
and and greg's going to talk about the

287
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
working group chairs training stuff and

288
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,079
and that's a really good example of that

289
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,480
in my mind can i just add one absolutely

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
so one of the things that this first

291
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
round of planning um actually was about

292
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,360
was figuring out

293
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
given a limited set of resources where

294
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
did folks want to apply those and where

295
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
was their energy to get things done when

296
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
there weren't resources available so

297
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,040
that's exactly the question that we

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
tried to get an approximate answer to

299
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
during the couple of months that we were

300
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
going through the planning and i'm sure

301
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,800
we'll do a better job of it next year

302
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
um

303
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
so with that actually greg uh now we're

304
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
ready for the update on chairs training

305
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
uh yeah fantastic so as as uh we just

306
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
noted um

307
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
this is an area where um

308
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
uh

309
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
it was pretty clear that outside energy

310
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,079
and expertise was needed um

311
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
to accomplish what was hoped being hoped

312
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
to

313
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,480
be accomplished

314
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
and we also had the experience of our

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
first run at this um

316
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,759
last year

317
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,519
uh so

318
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,279
um yeah so just a quick update we're

319
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
we've started uh conversations with the

320
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,160
same uh folks that

321
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,519
developed and delivered the training

322
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
last year there's um

323
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,639
a group of uh

324
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
community members that are most of them

325
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,839
are chairs or

326
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,079
uh past chairs or

327
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,360
and especially there are a few new

328
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
chairs that are involved

329
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,560
um

330
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
to provide guidance to the

331
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,160
subject matter expertise to the to the

332
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,240
development and delivery of the training

333
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,519
and um

334
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,519
so that we just had our kickoff call on

335
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
that uh last week and um we're on track

336
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,120
to

337
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,639
follow basically the same schedule that

338
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,600
we did

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,160
uh last year per plan uh with some um

340
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,759
slight changes so

341
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,120
uh one of the things that we really

342
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,399
learned last year is that people found

343
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,480
the interaction among chairs

344
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
that the sessions offered to be really

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
really valuable so instead of trying to

346
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,560
cover all this material we're focusing

347
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,279
on

348
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
the material that was most highly

349
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,639
rated

350
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
and to have a longer interactive session

351
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,959
so

352
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
tweak the

353
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
curriculum if you will to really focus

354
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
on interactivity um uh for i think we

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
have

356
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
four it's either four or six i need to

357
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
go back and look

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
um

359
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
multi-hour like two hour longer session

360
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,959
so people the ideas that people get

361
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,480
together

362
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
have a chance to interact and then

363
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,959
build relationships that will or

364
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,400
strengthen relationships that will help

365
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,679
them

366
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
continue on even after the the training

367
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
opportunity and then the other mode is

368
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,760
a shorter delivery of more informational

369
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
uh

370
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
uh

371
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
type of content

372
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
where people

373
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
uh have said they need to you know

374
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,360
they'd like to know how get some more

375
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
information about how to do a particular

376
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,160
thing better uh and so those would be

377
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
shorter you know like

378
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
online learning modules but hopefully

379
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
um uh the idea is to tailor them in a

380
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,039
way that make them

381
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
uh relevant and interesting enough so

382
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,559
that people actually want to do them

383
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
it's not a like a compliance training

384
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
video that you have to go through and

385
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
uh uh grudgingly do um they're

386
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
they're interesting so that's that's

387
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
where we are we just kicked off we're on

388
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,640
schedule

389
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,440
expect to deliver october november

390
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,919
and uh along the way we'll have a

391
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
same kind of evaluation and dashboarding

392
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,679
so we know what's working what's not

393
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
working so we can build on that for any

394
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
future training decided to do

395
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,720
sorry that was longer than i thought

396
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
any questions

397
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
yeah

398
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
yeah

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
yeah you uh so mary asks if it's the

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,440
same company and the short answer is yes

401
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
any other any other questions any remote

402
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
questions nope

403
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,760
okay great um

404
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
so the next thing is and this is what

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
we've already covered is the plan

406
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
is newcomers and i divided this into

407
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
newcomers at ietf just to give you some

408
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
idea of what we're what we did at this

409
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
ietf meeting

410
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
and

411
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,039
then i'm going to talk a little bit

412
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,559
about what our next steps are for the

413
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
various newcomer activities

414
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,840
um

415
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
the

416
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
first thing and sort of related to what

417
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
what you were mentioning about uh

418
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
staffing we we've had uh

419
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
increasing amounts of secretariat

420
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
support over the last couple times and

421
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,280
michelle has joined the team and we also

422
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
have jenny

423
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
who's been working with us on the

424
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
newcomer stuff

425
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,600
and we have a series of meetings

426
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
in advance

427
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,080
to

428
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
review what we've done in the past

429
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160
decide what we're going to do this time

430
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
and then execute them and send out all

431
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
the emails and those kinds of things

432
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
so the activities that we have are

433
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
the newcomers overview and i just lumped

434
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,679
these all together because they're

435
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,039
related

436
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
it what was originally the newcomers

437
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
tutorial has evolved into a series of

438
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,919
videos that are

439
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,000
online

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,919
a couple of q a sessions that we've been

441
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,840
doing in advance

442
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
and then the in-person tutorial that we

443
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
provided on sunday

444
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
this time we updated the in-person

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
tutorial but we did not get the videos

446
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,919
updated so we have some work to do there

447
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,520
but that's the

448
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
uh tutorial information on getting

449
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
started in the ietf

450
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
the next set of activities are

451
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
networking activities which are really

452
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,000
about

453
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
getting people to meet each other and

454
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
talk to each other

455
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,919
we had a quick connections on sunday

456
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
evening that was quite successful

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and we have

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
the monday night dinner that the

459
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
secretariat organizes was also quite

460
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
successful last night

461
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
and

462
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,600
we are going for one virtual coffee

463
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,280
break this time i believe it was earlier

464
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,600
today and i didn't actually make it so

465
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
um

466
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,559
in gather so we're still trying to

467
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,000
figure out

468
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,320
when we were all virtual we we

469
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
pretty we had a better idea of how to

470
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,200
handle

471
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
remote attendees

472
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
on the social or hallway track part

473
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,520
but we're really struggling with good

474
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,240
ideas on what to do

475
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
uh

476
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
to incorporate newcomer activities for

477
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
virtual attendees

478
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
so

479
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,120
i think that is a tough one

480
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,559
um the guides program team ran a guides

481
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,880
program this time i last i heard there

482
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,120
was 11 or 11 matches for that um

483
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
and that is

484
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
the uh

485
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
you know program where you can sign up

486
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
in advance and get matched with somebody

487
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
and then the final thing we will have

488
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
will be some feedback sessions there'll

489
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,720
be one

490
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
on site on thursday and then we're going

491
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
to have a remote one in a week or two

492
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
which is for any of the newcomers but

493
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
it also gives a better opportunity for

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,480
the remote remote folks to participate

495
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,039
um

496
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,320
in addition to this set of activities

497
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,280
there is a iet there's a webpage the

498
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
newcomers page

499
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
that gets updated with all of the

500
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
activities and there's a series of

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,679
emails that go out and that's all done

502
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,640
by the secretariat

503
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
so that was basically our program for

504
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,440
this ietf

505
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
so

506
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,720
next steps for newcomers and

507
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
oh on go ahead

508
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,240
in the queue you are

509
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,039
yes

510
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,799
andrew campbell speaking i i just

511
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,200

526
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320

528
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,600
i mean we meet every two weeks for like

529
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
10 weeks before which means go home rest

530
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,120
for a month and then we start planning

531
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
for the next one just so people can see

532
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,840
it and see the the nice table

533
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
i don't know if there's any objections

534
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
to sharing that

535
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,480
i i

536
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
uh

537
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
i was going to

538
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,400
just put a

539
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
uh i don't know if

540
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
i don't think there's anything

541
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
sir

542
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
are we ready to share this or

543
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
i don't think there's any secret

544
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
well there's nothing secret in here but

545
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,280
there might you know there might be like

546
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
you know misspellings or well yeah in

547
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
that document there are a series of like

548
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
tasks that have to be done as far as

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,760
when emails go out reminders that go out

550
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,170
so it's a lot of um

551
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,400
[Music]

552
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
basically check marks for the

553
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,440
secretariat staff to make sure that we

554
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
don't forget to do particular things and

555
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,799
then there is a very

556
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
a small calendar of the newcomer

557
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,600
activities um

558
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,919
what is remote and what is on site

559
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,799
and then we do have some um

560
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,279
participation numbers in a table that

561
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,679
we're going to track more closely uh

562
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,360
from now on

563
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,440
for all the different newcomer um

564
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,799
activities

565
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,320
uh so hopefully we'll have some uh

566
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,279
concrete data from now going forward to

567
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
be able to compare and see how we're

568
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,760
doing

569
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
um that's what's in that document that

570
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
rich is referring to

571
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
so this is robert maybe

572
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
when something like that is

573
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,320
shareable um you know i suggest sending

574
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
it to the

575
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
the

576
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
team luster program list

577
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,279
um when you're thinking about what to do

578
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,120
in sessions like this one remember that

579
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,039
the recording is going to be available

580
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,240
on youtube

581
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,159
and choose what content you share

582
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,880
appropriately

583
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,520
okay robert i could barely hear you did

584
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,279
i understand that you think it is

585
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,799
appropriate to share or not

586
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,080
um to be careful with it

587
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
i'm surprised that you're having trouble

588
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,960
hearing me is this better

589
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
you fade in and then get reasonably loud

590
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,480
and then fade out

591
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
yeah

592
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
must be doing something underneath me at

593
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,000
this point then because i'm

594
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,120
right up against my microphone

595
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,240
i will type what i said into the stream

596
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,360
you can read it there

597
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,600
yeah it's mostly a volume problem by the

598
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,959
way robert yeah but i just

599
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,960
regarding one of the data points

600
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,279
that we talked about even earlier was we

601
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,200
wanted to understand a little bit better

602
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
about newcomers behavior especially for

603
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,480
virtual ones that are they here only for

604
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
a single session are they attending

605
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
multiple itf

606
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
meetings that could also help us to like

607
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
you know trigger

608
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
how to bring them into the itf community

609
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,799
a little bit better because that's the

610
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,320
feedback somehow i got with the

611
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,640
newcomers that i was dealing with that

612
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
they were attending only a single

613
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,159
session and i was slowly trying to say

614
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,360
that get involved in more activities but

615
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,799
that's just like you know one or two

616
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,559
cases that i am aware of i wanted to

617
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,520
know what's

618
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
happening otherwise

619
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,679
uh with a lot of people because i was

620
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,039
tracking number of people who were

621
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,840
joining from my region and they really

622
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,799
did shoot up a virtual ones

623
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,760
from india and i wanted to retain that

624
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
and one thing that came up was that

625
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,000
people were like you know

626
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
finding it hard to attend multiple

627
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,080
groups in a remote setting and i wanted

628
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
to know like more concrete numbers on

629
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
that from other regions and otherwise if

630
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,039
that information could be made available

631
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
i think it would be a pretty good uh

632
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,120
info for this group as well

633
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,000
thank you

634
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,919
yeah i do remember we had some of those

635
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,159
conversations and i think um

636
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
we're looking at how to get better data

637
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
um

638
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
so thank you

639
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
pete yeah i was just wondering with

640
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
regard to like the coffee breaks and the

641
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
dinner and such

642
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
what is the aim to get

643
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,360
sort of the newcomers in their own

644
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
community to be able to have

645
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,919
buddies among the newcomers to get them

646
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,840
to meet

647
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,120
leadership uh

648
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,960
what's

649
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,559
i was the purpose

650
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,320
to me the purpose is for them to meet um

651
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
to meet each other and to meet a few

652
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,480
friendly faces at the ietf one of the

653
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
challenges with asking the leadership to

654
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
do too many things during ietf week is

655
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,039
the leadership is very busy

656
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,399
so this is

657
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,240
um

658
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,559
you know

659
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
you know a few like i know rich and i

660
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,279
have done a number of these coffee

661
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,120
breaks virtually and and you know just

662
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
whoever shows and actually when they've

663
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
been on the schedule

664
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
especially virtually face to face it's

665
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
been harder but virtually like sometimes

666
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,679
some of the leadership will show up for

667
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,960
that but um

668
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
and if i could have my two cents i think

669
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,679
that

670
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,559
the um the quick connections is is great

671
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
to connect newcomers to working group

672
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,840
chairs and people that know something

673
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
about the itf at the very beginning of

674
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,279
the week and the intent of the monday

675
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,200
night newcomers dinner it was newcomers

676
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,120
only really yeah so it's really about

677
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,679
bonding like a freshman class of itfurs

678
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,760
and getting them to form some bonds and

679
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,480
then

680
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,159
i think that the coffee breaks are sort

681
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,120
of like you've been here for a couple

682
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,559
days you have a quick question is there

683
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,320
something that we can help you with so

684
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,919
those the different roles that i see

685
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,559
those things playing

686
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,159
okay

687
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,919
thank you

688
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,919
um

689
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,799
so i did um

690
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
okay so we have

691
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,200
robert was saying that remember the

692
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
session will be available later choose

693
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
what you display appropriately

694
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,320
um

695
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,440
so i don't think there's anything

696
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
inappropriate in that document it's just

697
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,600
we did it as an internal document

698
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
as a help to ourselves and not

699
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
necessarily something that we planned to

700
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
post on a website

701
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,880
but it does

702
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
i have provided the link if you want to

703
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,399
go in and take a quick look especially

704
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,919
if you're interested in helping because

705
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,799
you know

706
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
you'll have some idea of what what

707
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,399
you're getting yourself into

708
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,440
um

709
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,200
so

710
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,640
uh

711
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,960
the next steps like i said we're

712
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
cleaning up and getting even more

713
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
organized i think we've

714
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
we continue to learn that the more that

715
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,000
we can get done in advance about you

716
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
know understanding what goes on the web

717
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,279
page what goes in the emails that need

718
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
to go out when the emails need to go out

719
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
and the more that we can have that

720
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
pre-stage which is which is really what

721
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,159
michelle and jenny uh have been doing

722
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,120
uh

723
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,279
has is really helpful

724
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,399
so for

725
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,559
ietf 115 there's a couple things i

726
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,840
wanted to highlight we will have a

727
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,679
review of 114

728
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,640
uh when we start our meetings up

729
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
and and in that we look at what do we

730
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
think worked well

731
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,279
uh what wasn't really that effective are

732
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
there any new ideas that we want to try

733
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
so now is a really good time if anybody

734
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
has any new ideas

735
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
to uh you know drop them on the mailing

736
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
list or something like that

737
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,200
and we'll come up with the plan for 115.

738
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,000
um

739
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the

740
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,080
you know the idea here is is that it

741
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,919
it's an evolving program so what it is

742
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,279
this year is not what it's going to be

743
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,880
next year i don't see us throwing

744
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
everything out and starting from scratch

745
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
i see us evolving it and making

746
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
improvements as we go

747
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,080
we do know that we need to work on uh

748
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
the survey and there's already some

749
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,919
drafting work been done on that in our

750
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,559
last series of meetings

751
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,559
we want to look at what are our success

752
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,919
measures and how do we measure that

753
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,960
success uh one of the interesting

754
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
things we've been discussing a little

755
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
bit about is that

756
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
you know is success somebody coming and

757
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
participating in newcomer programs or is

758
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,840
success somebody coming to the ietf and

759
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
being successful in the work that they

760
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
want to do

761
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,360
so

762
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
um you know a good number of newcomers

763
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,440
come to the ietf and they have support

764
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,880
from their institution and they have

765
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,159
support from colleagues that they

766
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,200
already know

767
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,799
and they may not need to participate in

768
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,480
newcomer programs whereas other people

769
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,159
come to the ietf and they're not at all

770
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,360
familiar

771
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,600
and they they really like that support

772
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
and so

773
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
i think we have to be really careful

774
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,480
with the metrics that we define and i

775
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
think we've struggled with that for a

776
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,799
while so um so we still have that set of

777
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,000
activities

778
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,120
um we are looking at extending the ietf

779
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
guides program we're planning to have a

780
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
brainstorm

781
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
on that in the near future we're going

782
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,679
to have it on

783
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,919
when are we having it is it the 15th do

784
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,360
you remember the date um we're gonna

785
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,399
actually

786
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,320
we're gonna reschedule it

787
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
in august you're right it's going to be

788
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,519
rescheduled for date in august and it

789
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,279
will be announced on imo durst anybody

790
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,039
that's interested in

791
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,880
coming to a session specifically on

792
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,279
brainstorming around the ietf guides

793
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,519
program

794
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,840
it's how can we better support virtual

795
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,279
attendees and how can we make it a

796
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,279
program that

797
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,640
is not tied so specifically to meetings

798
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
and other things as well but that's

799
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,679
that's really what drove us to this

800
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
point

801
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
and so with that

802
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,679
i'm looking to michelle is there

803
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,640
anything else we want to say

804
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,100
um

805
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,240
[Music]

806
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,399
i don't think at this time we're just

807
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,559
really dissecting

808
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,519
everything that's happening at 114

809
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,640
and

810
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
really

811
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
noting what worked well and what didn't

812
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,799
and any improvements that we can make

813
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,440
and i've been talking to a lot of

814
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,000
newcomers at this meeting and i'm going

815
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,919
to be following up just to gather

816
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,440
feedback and

817
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
um

818
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
i'm happy for anybody to talk to me

819
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,080
about their experience and um

820
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
what what was missing because that's

821
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
really what we're trying to figure out

822
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,519
also and like karen said

823
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,120
we're trying to figure out those

824
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
measures of success and we're trying to

825
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,480
be very careful

826
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
and we're going to incorporate what we

827
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,000
come up with in future surveys to really

828
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,919
focus in on what information we're

829
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,200
trying to

830
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,799
collect and measure

831
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,039
so

832
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,440
andrew

833
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,120
hi it's uh andrew camping um

834
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
i'm conscious that a while ago jay from

835
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,840
one of the previous surveys one of the

836
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,760
stats that really jumped out at me was

837
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,919
the number of first-time participants

838
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,159
that we never see again

839
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,360
um

840
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
so they come once and then

841
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,600
for whatever reason uh

842
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,399
that

843
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
you might infer that way maybe it wasn't

844
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,240
a good experience or achieve whatever

845
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,679
they wanted but

846
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,159
do do we or will we ask

847
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,519
are you gonna

848
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,559
come again and if so why and if not why

849
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,559
not something as simple as that just to

850
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
get a sense of

851
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,280
because they made the effort of coming

852
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,960
once

853
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
it'd be a shame if we continue without

854
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,719
such a high attrition rate because that

855
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
feels really bad

856
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,960
so we're definitely talking about that

857
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
exact um

858
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
questioning we just have to really

859
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,239
figure out how we want to ask it

860
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,480
yeah but we're definitely talking about

861
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
that

862
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,679
okay

863
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
uh

864
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,800
any other questions or comments on the

865
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,919
newcomers program

866
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,879
nick is joining the queue

867
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,839
go ahead nick

868
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,159
i was curious if um

869
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,800
newcomers included uh just newcomers to

870
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,480
an ietf meeting or newcomers to ietf

871
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,720
mailing lists or idf participation in

872
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,240
general it seems like it will be

873
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,079
different

874
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,359
there would there be different success

875
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,640
measures and different needs

876
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,520
so

877
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,640
uh

878
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
as you were saying that i i realized one

879
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,839
of the other things that i had wanted to

880
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,839
mention that was on our

881
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,320
give a think about list is

882
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
how we define newcomers

883
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,119
uh

884
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,400
and in you know years ago newcomers were

885
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,160
it's the fir your first time coming to a

886
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,240
physical newcomer meeting and then we

887
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,640
changed it to five or fewer meetings and

888
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,359
now we think it's a even more general

889
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,960
definition than that and we don't know

890
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,640
what that definition is yet

891
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,240
yeah that's i wanted to add that as well

892
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,040
um

893
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
and thank you nick for the question

894
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
because there's some interesting work by

895
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,320
the soda stream project which is

896
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,480
analyzing a lot of data from mailing

897
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,520
lists uh archives which are open

898
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
and for example one of the conclusions

899
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
that they came with

900
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
was that people who

901
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
joined the mailing list and then very

902
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,320
soon after they joined the mailing list

903
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,400
had an interaction with someone who was

904
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
more experienced tended to stick around

905
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,160
and of course we don't know if

906
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,079
they had the interaction with the more

907
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,359
experienced

908
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,640
participant because their initial

909
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,079
intervention was

910
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
more

911
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
interesting to experience participants

912
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,400
or you know what the the cause

913
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,440
uh the flow the flow there is um but but

914
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,720
also just to point out that also um

915
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,480
yeah the the

916
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,000
um

917
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
current um

918
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,760
uh setup is is seems to be um

919
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,040
meeting specific and i know there's

920
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,040
thinking about that and also even the

921
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
there's been discussion about the term

922
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,839
of newcomer because people who

923
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,200
self-identify as very experienced

924
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,119
technologists may not

925
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
be attracted to things that are labeled

926
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,680
as uh for newcomers so

927
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,160
uh yeah just the i know the conversation

928
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,320
that karen and folks are having is

929
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,640
pretty nuanced about stuff yep

930
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
yeah and uh

931
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,960
just for another weirdness i happen to

932
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
be sitting in a room today where the

933
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,920
chair had a newcomers uh

934
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,200
uh ribbon on their badge because

935
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,480
he's been around

936
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
for a long time in the community and we

937
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,560
know him from different circles

938
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
but he never came to meetings

939
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
um and to a certain extent it would

940
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,119
probably be useful in some circumstances

941
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,480
for him to do newcomer stuff but most it

942
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,839
wasn't and so dividing down to yeah

943
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,280
people who've been participating on the

944
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,119
list and know us in different

945
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,640
circumstances

946
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,119
but haven't been to meetings are a class

947
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,680
that we want to sort of bring in once

948
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,240
they hit the list not just

949
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,799
now years after the the case

950
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,839
yeah i i guess absolutely that's what i

951
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,000
was thinking is that

952
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,280
right i know there are going to be some

953
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
yeah experienced people who who show up

954
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,720
at a meeting and but they're already

955
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
they're they're already ready to go

956
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,119
because they they have a lot of

957
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,560
connections maybe they need some things

958
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,280
about how how the meeting is run um but

959
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,040
i'm concerned more about that

960
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
that sort of pipeline effective there

961
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,760
are lots of people who come to our

962
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,240
mailing list one time

963
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,839
have a terrible experience and then

964
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,320
leave and um and then that person is not

965
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
going to ever attend an in-person

966
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
meeting um

967
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,200
so it might be a different sort of

968
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,119
programs but um

969
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,160
there

970
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,920
might be things we want to do to

971
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
increase that pipeline at the set of

972
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,599
mailing lists or online level

973
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,119
yeah i think we're definitely interested

974
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:43,760
in

975
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,400
ideas on how to improve people's first

976
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,760
experiences in the ietf

977
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
so

978
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,599
so is there anything else on the

979
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,960
newcomer program we wish to discuss

980
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,920
john john go ahead

981
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,400
uh greg and to the state you've gotten

982
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
an earful about this as as if some

983
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,359
others participants and directorate

984
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,960
but i think that one of the most

985
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
important things we can do

986
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,839
is that when somebody shows up on a

987
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,240
mailing list or trying to write a draft

988
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,959
and uh

989
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,560
and

990
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,839
and

991
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,160
intends to constructively participate

992
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,440
that we don't have people making

993
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,839
assumptions about who they are and what

994
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
their motives are and uh

995
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
and why they're doing those things and

996
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,079
then turning around and generally

997
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
beating them up without listening off

998
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
list

999
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,760
in many respects that not a

1000
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
problem for this directorate but it's

1001
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
certainly not a problem for anybody else

1002
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
either and it's definitely a problem if

1003
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
we are

1004
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,520
trying to

1005
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,320
recruit newcomers and recruit those

1006
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,880
people and anybody they might talk with

1007
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
and uh i think there are some very

1008
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,800
significant steps we need to be taking

1009
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,000
there that we are clearly not including

1010
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
not making it harder to figure out the

1011
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,079
contact with those issues and not making

1012
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,920
the people the contact blow them off

1013
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,760
sorry that's my rant for today

1014
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
no thank you john i know we have uh

1015
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
teed up a conversation with you on this

1016
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,160
subject so

1017
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,520
there was one thing i wanted to go back

1018
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,359
to real briefly on the you know changing

1019
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,280
the

1020
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,480
meaning of

1021
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
newcomers i mean it's just like the sort

1022
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
of some of the challenges that we see

1023
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
here with the

1024
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,800
you know the tooling when we decide

1025
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,640
we're doing one thing and then we change

1026
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,240
it sometimes that has a whole bunch of

1027
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,000
unintended consequences so one of the

1028
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,520
things is is that

1029
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,960
uh you know

1030
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,560
there the through the registration

1031
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,960
system is where we identify newcomers

1032
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,720
and it's run you know it's set up and

1033
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,319
done a certain way

1034
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,040
and if we change it we the registration

1035
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
system has to be changed or the tags or

1036
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,400
whatever you know i don't know all the

1037
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,880
details of it but but these are things

1038
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
where you know we can't just snap our

1039
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,720
fingers and say okay this is the new

1040
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,079
the new thing

1041
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,440
um

1042
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,359
so we need to

1043
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,200
think it through and and try not to make

1044
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
too many changes too frequently but i do

1045
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
think that this is one we're definitely

1046
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
interested in in looking at moving

1047
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,200
forward

1048
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,119
all right

1049
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,440
anything else on newcomers

1050
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
all right so the next thing that we had

1051
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,200
teed up was an idea that uh

1052
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,640
that um

1053
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,359
andrew had sent um

1054
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,200
andrew sent you his slides and not me

1055
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,720
right

1056
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,079
yeah that's a really can you just send

1057
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,880
me your slides

1058
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,200
um so

1059
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,040
while he's uh

1060
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
while he's doing this i'm just gonna um

1061
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
skip over to a few things that we'll

1062
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,280
we'll talk to at the end one is

1063
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,520
we do have open meetings like virtual

1064
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,040
meetings

1065
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
roughly every six weeks

1066
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,880
and they are announced on the emoji

1067
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,560
mailing list and they're listed in

1068
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,240
upcoming meetings and so that's one way

1069
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,720
that you can participate the second way

1070
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,560
and i'm a lot of you i believe are

1071
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,920
already this way

1072
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,079
you can join mailing the mailing list

1073
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
and

1074
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,000
uh

1075
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,280
so

1076
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,119
oh look at that slides from andrew

1077
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,359
um

1078
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,560
and so

1079
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
part of what we're encouraging here is

1080
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,839
if people go back and look at the agenda

1081
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,560
and look at the um

1082
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
uh

1083
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
i i shouldn't talk you should talk but

1084
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
i'll do this

1085
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,640
karen is focused on getting his slides

1086
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,599
up so andrew can be prepared um

1087
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,720
uh

1088
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,839
or present

1089
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,160
um

1090
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,839
i i don't i don't think that they're i

1091
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,520
was just looking at our agenda i don't i

1092
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,000
i think that there aren't any other

1093
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
items to cover and i just did want to

1094
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,359
note that we're um

1095
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,280
scheduled to end at 6 15 i think and so

1096
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
uh

1097
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,480
if we haven't covered something here uh

1098
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,680
and you aren't yet signed up for the

1099
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
emoji list as karen said please sign up

1100
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,839
for the emoji list that's a good way to

1101
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,319
stay in touch and

1102
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,720
if we don't cover something here now uh

1103
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,560
we can definitely take up conversations

1104
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,359
on

1105
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,560
on the list

1106
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,319
or uh

1107
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,079
the next um

1108
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,920
it's kind of a virtual interim but not

1109
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,880
really

1110
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
um yeah

1111
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
uh it's not officially maybe it is

1112
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,760
officially virtual interim for emoter

1113
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,000
yeah so anyway so

1114
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
if you have good ideas feel please feel

1115
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,760
free to share them

1116
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,920
uh on the list and then we can discuss

1117
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
them at the meeting

1118
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,079
and with that you have slides

1119
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,400
perfect timing

1120
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
can i change them from here or do

1121
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,079
okay fine

1122
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,560
right so this uh just by the way a bit

1123
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,040
of context uh this is that we discussed

1124
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,240
briefly at the last virtual meeting

1125
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
um so there's a bit of duplication with

1126
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,599
that but i figured that since some of

1127
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,280
the people here weren't there it'd be

1128
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
useful just to

1129
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,480
refresh memories

1130
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,359
um uh and run through it so it's a

1131
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,920
proposed outreach pilot

1132
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,440
um this is

1133
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,839
driven by uh i think i i certainly have

1134
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,000
a view that the voice of end users is

1135
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,920
not very strong in in the ietf community

1136
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,359
or it could be stronger perhaps there's

1137
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
a better way of putting it and this is

1138
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
one activity of maybe several that will

1139
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
help

1140
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
that to improve that and also to

1141
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,920
diversify

1142
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,800
the

1143
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
make makeup of the community

1144
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,599
so next slide please

1145
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,560
so the the intent is to

1146
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,200
effectively diversify the participation

1147
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,760
beyond the tech sector in particular

1148
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,440
with specific emphasis um on civil

1149
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,040
society and on sort of enterprises in

1150
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,960
sectors other than the tech sector it

1151
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,560
doesn't have to be exclusively limited

1152
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,880
to that but that will be the primary

1153
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,359
sort two focus areas

1154
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,319
um and the objective would be to get the

1155
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
i think rich use uh to coin this phrase

1156
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,079
the itf

1157
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,200
curious

1158
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,280
um to

1159
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,359
come along to

1160
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,119
london um

1161
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,440
not to actually come to the main meeting

1162
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
but to come to an event that'll be

1163
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,520
effectively co-located with the main

1164
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,560
meeting

1165
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,440
to

1166
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,040
engage a bit

1167
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,680
um and use that as a way to try and

1168
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,119
encourage them to engage more afterwards

1169
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,960
okay so just be using the fact that

1170
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,480
we're going to be in

1171
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,640
london and take advantage of having some

1172
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,119
of the community there to try and just

1173
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,760
get them to make the next step

1174
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
and answering a question which

1175
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,240
was was posed i can't remember by whom

1176
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,520
at their last virtual interim

1177
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,560
i propose that we focus principally on

1178
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,000
people like directors of policy and ctos

1179
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,160
in those organizations

1180
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,319
not because they will necessarily

1181
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,760
personally be the future participants

1182
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
but they will if they're persuaded that

1183
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,200
there's a business case if you like for

1184
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,359
their organization to be involved they

1185
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,680
can then task people in their teams to

1186
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,000
then actually do the the follow-up work

1187
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,280
so

1188
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
it will hopefully save the time of their

1189
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
people

1190
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,640
having to write a business case if

1191
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,880
they're effectively the their leaders

1192
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
make the decision it will be a good idea

1193
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
um so they just tell them to do it

1194
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,720
rather than have to be persuaded

1195
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,400
afterwards

1196
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
um and my assumption for what it's worth

1197
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,480
is uh because it f115s in london that

1198
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
it's most likely to be attractive as a

1199
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,720
session to people who are in europe

1200
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,040
not that it'd be limited to that but but

1201
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,560
but on the other hand if the pilot is

1202
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,119
successful then going forward if it was

1203
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,640
something which was done regularly then

1204
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,800
over time it would

1205
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,839
diversify on a geographic basis as well

1206
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,680
as on the sectorial

1207
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,240
basis the the participation

1208
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,879
and next slide please

1209
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,240
uh so for clarity the objective is to

1210
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,319
broader broaden participation in the itf

1211
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,440
not necessarily in itf meetings um just

1212
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,880
to be really clear perhaps picking up on

1213
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,000
the conversation that we were just

1214
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,200
having

1215
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,040
but it might be that the future

1216
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,720
engagement by those organizations might

1217
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,319
be on mailing lists

1218
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,559
um or by authoring documents or it could

1219
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,920
be at meetings or it could be any

1220
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,280
combination

1221
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,960
of those things but

1222
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
if an

1223
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
in mailing lists organizat

1224
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,319
that i think that will be a reasonable

1225
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,440
success

1226
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,800
um if they

1227
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,079
even if they don't come to meetings i

1228
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,000
don't think that's important as long as

1229
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,920
they're there there's more engagement

1230
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,760
the structure i'm proposing is a half

1231
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,079
day uh workshop

1232
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,319
uh as i say co-located at the same

1233
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,960
location as ietf 115 just because

1234
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
that'll make the logistics a lot easier

1235
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,720
for everyone

1236
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,160
um

1237
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,599
probably starting at lunchtime and

1238
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,520
running through to to the evening so

1239
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,319
half day um doing it at lunchtime so

1240
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,119
that people that coming from countries

1241
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,359
in europe but not not the uk they've got

1242
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,960
a chance to actually get there

1243
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
um and then they can

1244
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,240
leave at the end rather than necessarily

1245
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,800
having to stay

1246
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,359
commit to a a stay

1247
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,800
overnight

1248
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,640
um

1249
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,319
but with remote access for those people

1250
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,319
that don't necessarily want to travel

1251
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,839
that will be a bonus if we can do remote

1252
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,440
access as well next slide please

1253
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,160
and apologies

1254
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
for the small font i put this together a

1255
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,880
bit quickly um just before the meeting

1256
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,240
um so as a sort of proposed structure

1257
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,839
that and this is only a just as a

1258
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,160
a working suggestion

1259
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,040
um

1260
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,599
basically to start by explaining what

1261
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,200
the ietf is um and not just the itf

1262
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,680
itself but the various associated bodies

1263
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,319
the

1264
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,480
irtf iesg etc how that all works

1265
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,319
how it fits in with other standards

1266
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,079
bodies how the governance of the whole

1267
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,520
thing works and so just to explain the

1268
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,720
mechanics

1269
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,839
because for those of us that perhaps

1270
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,760
when you come to it new it's all very

1271
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,880
strange

1272
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,079
um

1273
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,480
so just explaining that up front will i

1274
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,839
think reduce

1275
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,760
the complexities to people that want to

1276
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,440
engage

1277
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,079
in it and and my suggestion is that uh

1278
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,000
jason and or jay would be the ideal

1279
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,480
people to maybe lead that session

1280
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,280
because

1281
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,800
they probably know that pretty well i

1282
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
would hope

1283
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,839
um

1284
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,520
then to bring in

1285
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,119
i think be useful to get a sense of so

1286
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,319
what does the ietf do

1287
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,839
and i think it'd be really good to bring

1288
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,440
in the area directors to each explain in

1289
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,000
very high level terms what their area

1290
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,119
does

1291
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,599
maybe with a view to saying focus not

1292
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:14,960
try and explain everything because that

1293
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,280
will take probably a day for each one

1294
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,520
but say pick one or two

1295
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,200
working groups

1296
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,800
that they think will be

1297
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,640
more easy to understand and more

1298
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
directly relevant to the target

1299
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,559
community than just say what they're

1300
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,720
currently working on that is relevant to

1301
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,640
that target community

1302
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,240
um

1303
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,000
rather than everything that they do

1304
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,240
which is a long long conversation and a

1305
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,680
lot of the stuff let's be honest is

1306
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,119
quite obscure

1307
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,359
um and wouldn't be very understandable

1308
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,839
so just pick the exciting stuff

1309
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,720
uh basically uh so to give 10 minutes

1310
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280
plus five minutes q a for each area

1311
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
and so

1312
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,880
using the fact that we're on site with

1313
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,720
the meeting to bring the area directors

1314
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,720
into the room physically uh in person

1315
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,280
uh then move on to explain how to engage

1316
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
with the itf because obviously that's

1317
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,440
the primary objective of this so

1318
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,720
you know through the mailing lists

1319
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,480
through the meetings interim meetings

1320
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,960
drafts etcetera etcetera so just bring

1321
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,160
that to life

1322
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,040
how they can do stuff with the community

1323
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,960
um and that and then finish off with a

1324
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,720
plenary um and q a and some networking

1325
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,119
and um i don't think i've got a next

1326
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,400
slide but just in case i have

1327
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,640
oh i did have a next slide right

1328
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,720
excellent i'm glad i said that

1329
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
so um

1330
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,680
and then finally i've had some

1331
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,839
very informal discussions with potential

1332
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,359
participants

1333
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,440
so some business bodies some civil

1334
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
society groups

1335
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
just literally to say

1336
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,440
explain the concept and say if we were

1337
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,240
to do this would you come

1338
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,079
so not committing the fact that it will

1339
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,599
happen but just say hypothetically if

1340
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,040
this sort of thing were to happen would

1341
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
you be sufficiently interested to come

1342
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,640
would you recommend this to your members

1343
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,280
to come etc etc and so far um

1344
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,720
everyone that i've spoken to has said

1345
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,800
yes that they would

1346
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
um and i have pressed them a bit to make

1347
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,160
sure they're just not being polite and

1348
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,680
they actually do mean that they would

1349
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,640
come

1350
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,680
and they assure me that that's the case

1351
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,280
but um two final points one is

1352
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,040
london's not that very far away

1353
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,200
time-wise so worry to do this it's going

1354
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,359
to take some time to actually spread the

1355
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,280
word and get people to get it in their

1356
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,640
diary

1357
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,480
so we would need to make a decision

1358
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,720
sooner rather than later whether we want

1359
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,400
this to happen

1360
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,720
i'm happy to really lead on getting

1361
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,119
people to commit to come

1362
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,599
but really need some help from the sort

1363
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,920
of the ihf team in terms of

1364
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,520
making sure that there is a room that

1365
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,440
this is going to happen in uh that we

1366
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,280
can get the area directors to come along

1367
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,040
and you know basically all the really

1368
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,400
complicated logistics um is you know i

1369
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
can get bums on seats but there need to

1370
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,720
be seats and people to talk to them and

1371
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,839
all the

1372
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,319
organizational stuff so it needs an

1373
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,160
early decision uh sooner rather than

1374
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,920
later whether this it feels like the

1375
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,359
right thing to be doing

1376
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,920
and i'll stop there

1377
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,440
something that just popped in my head

1378
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,839
that's probably pretty critical

1379
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:20,720
um

1380
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,359
as you were talking about having the 80s

1381
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,640
come in to talk

1382
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,359
you know the itf week is an is a crazy

1383
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,800
week for them

1384
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,839
um

1385
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,319
and i think we're gonna have to do some

1386
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,240
careful planning

1387
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,520
with finding time slots um that would

1388
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,359
work um

1389
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,599
and just that's probably if that's

1390
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,680
really important to have them there

1391
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,200
that's probably something that has to be

1392
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,119
considered

1393
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,920
very very soon

1394
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,359
thanks um i would just

1395
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,480
oh sorry

1396
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,640
go ahead mary

1397
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,920
yeah because i actually want to add

1398
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,200
something i think there's actually zero

1399
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
chance to get like most of the area

1400
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
actors and in there we just discussed

1401
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,839
um some kind of retreat like things that

1402
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,720
we

1403
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,160
that the iap thinks that they could

1404
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,079
attach to a meeting but for the ihd this

1405
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,760
is kind of impossible so i don't think

1406
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,599
um

1407
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,200
if you want especially if you want to

1408
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,520
have this in like this large scope that

1409
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,400
is absolutely impossible i think

1410
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,280
um

1411
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,440
also i i really

1412
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,040
want to say that there's a big

1413
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,480
difference between

1414
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,160
policy makers um and industry

1415
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,920
and i think they they not only need

1416
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,200
different information they also need

1417
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,559
different treatment

1418
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,640
and when it's about policy makers i

1419
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,240
think the ib needs to be involved and i

1420
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,520
think we should we should rely on isoc

1421
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,960
because icelock has already these

1422
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,680
relations to the policy makers that we

1423
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,520
should rely on and there's also like a

1424
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,160
whole lot of sensitivity here i mean i

1425
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,599
understand that you mainly want to

1426
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,359
explain how the ihf works to these

1427
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,960
people and that is a very important task

1428
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,640
and we should definitely do that

1429
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,480
um but when you when you actually give

1430
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,000
policy makers

1431
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,480
um the chance to to come and have this

1432
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,000
special forum

1433
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,119
um

1434
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040
we also have to prepare to be prepared

1435
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
for all kind kind of questions which

1436
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
might be very sensitive

1437
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,839
um

1438
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,319
and uh and so i think we should not like

1439
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,240
do this easily

1440
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,680
um

1441
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,720
yeah i think that's my point

1442
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,119
i know one more point i actually

1443
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,720
have it on my list

1444
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,040
to talk to isoc about providing some

1445
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,880
kind of forum

1446
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,359
maybe in a much smaller sense to have an

1447
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,400
exchange with policymakers

1448
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,079
and just to um

1449
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,400
be fair andrew did reach out to me and

1450
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,160
ask icehawk's opinion on this and i just

1451
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,799
haven't gotten back to him yet so

1452
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,319
um

1453
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,440
there's a lot of

1454
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,520
so i do think that there is

1455
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,200
some opportunity there but we'll have to

1456
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,960
talk about it further and obviously

1457
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,720
we're in no position to commit at this

1458
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,959
point

1459
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,280
um i just want to chime in and say i

1460
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,400
think mira's point about uh the uh area

1461
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,160
directors is a good one i mean i've seen

1462
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,599
some of the scheduling conversations

1463
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,520
it's so hard that said i love this idea

1464
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,839
um i think this would piggyback on some

1465
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,920
outreach efforts that i'm interested in

1466
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,200
from you know fundraising and

1467
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,040
recruitment i also think it would be

1468
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,000
really

1469
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,839
good in helping us

1470
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,200
understand how to talk to different

1471
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,440
audiences

1472
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,559
and you know i agree the policy maker

1473
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,720
conversations are different but those

1474
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,440
who work for industry and then work in

1475
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,559
policy i think can straddle that line

1476
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,400
and i think there is a really

1477
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,079
interesting opportunity for engagement

1478
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,400
there so i do agree there's a lot of

1479
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,040
logistical complications um

1480
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,799
that said if you are looking for an

1481
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,640
internal champion i will be one with you

1482
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,799
i i just wanted to say

1483
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,599
don't hang your hat too much on just

1484
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,480
having isg people there there are

1485
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,319
sufficient numbers of us

1486
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,119
ex

1487
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,640
and sufficiently gray-haired people to

1488
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,280
do this kind of stuff and not interfere

1489
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,119
with their whole week which i think with

1490
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,520
ads you're inevitably gonna do

1491
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,440
um so there's lots of people who can do

1492
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,599
this

1493
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,920
uh and then i think we have drew

1494
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,280
yeah i

1495
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,760
just want to echo one more point i think

1496
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,400
especially with enterprise if we have

1497
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,720
folks from the enterprise also come in

1498
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,880
and say why do they participate

1499
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,119
that would be very helpful because when

1500
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,440
we go and like you know preach from our

1501
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,280
side that like itf is this great

1502
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,760
organization i think why is the most

1503
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,119
important question that why should

1504
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,160
enterprise

1505
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,280
even care

1506
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,359
and for that instead of focusing too

1507
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,319
much on what itf does and how

1508
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,079
sorry what is still important like how

1509
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,240
it functions is not the most important

1510
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,079
thing it's like why should they

1511
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,760
participate and if we can have some case

1512
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,720
studies

1513
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,240
on like you know

1514
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,000
like even listen directly from

1515
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,359
enterprise folks which are currently

1516
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,440
there we know that we have very few but

1517
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,760
there are they are here and we could

1518
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,400
maybe use them as are like you know the

1519
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,559
main champions rather than ads

1520
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,000
uh i know we cut the cue uh but mira did

1521
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,160
you have one thing you wanted to say

1522
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,839
yeah i want to emphasize this again that

1523
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,680
i think like policymakers and and

1524
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,839
industry elite is is a very different

1525
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,119
audience and we should not put them

1526
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,040
together because they need different um

1527
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,880
uh information

1528
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,799
and i think um

1529
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,240
lee berkeley and andrew were more

1530
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,760
talking about

1531
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,079
um enterprise or industry

1532
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,839
and so that's a different business um

1533
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,040
and

1534
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,410
um

1535
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,799
[Music]

1536
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,640
sorry it's already late

1537
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,559
i lost i lost my thought it was

1538
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,720
something else uh so like i think the

1539
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,799
challenge here is actually to

1540
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,680
for for policy makers we also um

1541
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,319
should like uh rely on isoc's context

1542
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,599
right so this is like something that is

1543
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,359
more straightforward for me um but i

1544
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,960
think the challenge is not like

1545
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,400
organizing this workshop the chinese

1546
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,599
actually get the right people into the

1547
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,079
workshop

1548
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,240
everyone wants to say one

1549
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,200
okay andrew please yes so just on on the

1550
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,880
policymakers

1551
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,319
i should say my background is as a

1552
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,160
policy maker uh in in industry so

1553
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,000
in case i wasn't clear that the intent

1554
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,559
is here is ideally to have pairs of

1555
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,640
people so the sort of cto and the

1556
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,720
director of policy together

1557
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,640
because the cto clearly should be more

1558
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,440
familiar with the technical aspects up

1559
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,799
to a point

1560
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,880
the policy director will have a much

1561
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,799
better understanding of how that relates

1562
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,720
to what their business is trying to

1563
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,119
achieve and the point is to have the two

1564
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,160
together uh wherever possible

1565
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,000
um okay so you're not talking about

1566
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,240
governmental representatives no no this

1567
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,119
is

1568
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,359
policy directors in india you know

1569
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,880
that's fine but like you also had like

1570
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
civil society on there and like i would

1571
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,520
put them rather in the bucket together

1572
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,280
with um with governmental

1573
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,359
representatives um from the kind of

1574
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,880
information they might be looking for

1575
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,400
okay so the sort of people i spoke to in

1576
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,200
civil society some of them have uh

1577
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,079
policy directors and and also ctos

1578
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,640
within civil society groups

1579
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,200
um so again

1580
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,799
we're and that's not true of all of them

1581
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,400
by the way some of them don't have ctos

1582
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,240
but those that do i think it'd be much

1583
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,240
more effective to have have both

1584
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,160
together they'll get more out of a

1585
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,599
discussion

1586
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,720
but

1587
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,200
than either coming in isolation so maybe

1588
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,480
we should actually look through the list

1589
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,319
of people more concretely that you've

1590
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,160
been in touch with i think that would be

1591
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,200
very useful

1592
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,440
yeah i actually i think there's a lot of

1593
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,960
agreement about the potential uh value

1594
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,960
of the kind of outreach but maybe just

1595
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,400
not the

1596
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,680
exact

1597
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,160
proposed format

1598
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,680
so i didn't hear anybody say no you

1599
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,960
shouldn't do this

1600
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,319
but just not maybe not in this format um

1601
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,640
and it also feels like there's an energy

1602
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,079
around the table or around the virtual

1603
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,280
table to

1604
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,720
i saw

1605
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,440
some comments in the chat maybe there's

1606
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,359
a conversation that can continue and um

1607
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,280
i know time is short for 1 15 but

1608
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,960
i don't know karen what you think about

1609
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,200
that

1610
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,880
well i think if we're going to do it for

1611
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,319
115 we

1612
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,839
we need to have some additional

1613
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,200
conversations and we need to get those

1614
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,119
scheduled very soon uh so uh

1615
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,240
i i

1616
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,559
i would start with suggesting the group

1617
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,839
of people that are really interested in

1618
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,319
helping to drive that to define this and

1619
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,599
drive it

1620
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,520
if you could

1621
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,200
perhaps identify yourselves to greg and

1622
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,160
i afterwards and then we can

1623
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,079
see see what the possibilities are and

1624
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,680
then i think we are going to need to get

1625
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,240
leadership sign off on this uh we're

1626
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,240
we're going to need to and resourcing

1627
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,359
sign off

1628
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,200
yeah if it involves any idea of

1629
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
leadership or idea of resources for sure

1630
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,079
yeah so uh it's it's it's not a i think

1631
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:02,960
that

1632
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,760
there is a lot of energy and

1633
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,599
there's some good ideas here we need to

1634
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,079
figure out how to move forward with them

1635
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,440
uh part of what we're trying to do with

1636
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,039
emo door is to define things as little

1637
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,440
projects that can pretty much work

1638
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,760
you know they can

1639
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,520
can get critical mass and move forward

1640
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,599
so um lee are you willing to work on

1641
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,520
this i'm going to put you on the spot

1642
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,079
yes absolutely okay

1643
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,490
and he'll be my right hand man

1644
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,760
[Laughter]

1645
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,599
all right so it's uh

1646
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,119
6 17 and so um i was going to ask amir i

1647
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,960
don't know if you wanted we we went over

1648
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,160
the plan and i said that there were

1649
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,599
quick some quick start guides and that

1650
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,359
you were working on coordinating a bunch

1651
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,720
of us did you want to say anything more

1652
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,640
or is that enough

1653
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,839

turnout and a really positive discussion

1657

1659
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,480
