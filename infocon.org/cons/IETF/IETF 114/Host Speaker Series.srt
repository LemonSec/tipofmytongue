long pandemic

uh where we all spend way too much on

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
looking at video screens

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,240
um

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,560

instrumental uh in in everything that we

um i also want to thank uh everyone each

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,599
and every one of you for all the hard

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,239
work over the years in making internet

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
delivery what it has been right if you

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,319
really take a step back and think about

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
this march 13th which was a friday of

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
2020 we all went home

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
okay and the network in a day needed to

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
adapt to a scenario that none of us

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
really expected right who would have

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
thought that in our lifetimes we all

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
would go home jump on teams and zooms

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
and you know what whatever other video

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
communication

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
that you're using

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
and stay there for two years straight

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
and really be able to adapt and grow

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
uh and add additional subscribers to the

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
network while we were doing this uh

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
truly unprecedented uh and it really

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
speaks to the robustness of the

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
engineering work and and and and work

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
that we've done together as an industry

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,200
and i mean industry in the broader sense

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
of the world uh in order to uh harden

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
the internet delivery to the point where

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
in this country uh we were one of the um

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,640
the only countries in the world where we

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
did not need to go to netflix to ask

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
them to downgrade their video delivery

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,080
europe other parts of the world not here

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,120
and i take

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
quite a bit of pride in that i really do

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,720
is having the opportunity to lead the

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,599
team

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,560
as we've done that uh and i had a great

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
discussion earlier with stuart at apple

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
who commented about the uh improvements

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
that we've done in latency throughout

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
all of this uh and that i think again

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
that speaks volume to the technical

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,439
leadership

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,400
that you know comes from this

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
organization and many thanks for that

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,599
okay

108
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
let's start talking about our actual uh

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
roadmap so

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
first and foremost for the folks who are

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
not familiar with comcast or you know

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
maybe familiar but don't quite

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
understand how big our network is it's

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,079
really big

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,839
it's really really big

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
when you really look at the network

117
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
end-to-end over a million

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
miles of fiber and clocks plant spread

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,199
across the entire u.s

120
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,880
39 states in the district of columbia

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
where we service our customers

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
throughout that footprint

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
in terms of the delivery

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
how many transactions are we actually

125
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
carrying through and i think that that

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
is uh such i'm trying to you know

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
balance between all these screens uh so

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
that you could still see the screen and

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
i could uh you know not uh you know get

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
out of uh view for the lens

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
um

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
1.3 trillion dns lookups every day

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
1.3 trillion

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
capacity literally doubling on the

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
access network every two and a half

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
years so think about it this way comcast

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
has been in the high speed uh

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,600
business since uh late uh the late 90s

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
right and every two and a half years we

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,000
need to double what it took us to build

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,320
30 years

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
pretty pretty amazing

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
and um when you look at

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
the

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
investment that we continuously put into

146
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
the network in 2021 alone and i'll talk

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
about the stats of 2021 and one of our

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
next slides we've invested over four

149
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,960
billion dollars into the network

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
and over 20 billion dollars over the uh

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,039
you know the uh the horizon since uh

152
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,000
2017 and this year we're continuously um

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in uh continuing with our investment in

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
the network uh because capacity

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
continues to grow our customer needs

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
continue to evolve uh and my team's job

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
is to make sure that the network will

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
always be infinitely scalable and will

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
be able to never endure business growth

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
okay

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,880
so let's go into uh uh what 2021 was and

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
it's funny the summarized 2021 were

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
almost uh in august of uh 2022

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
uh but it's i thought it would be

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
interesting to kind of take a step back

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
and look at you know where we come from

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
before we talk about where we head into

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
as

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
much as we saw

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
internet growth in 2020 and we saw

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
explosive internet growth and added

172
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
millions of subscribers to our network

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
which we're very happy to do

174
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
um

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
in 2021 we continue to grow um uh usage

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
okay both downstream and upstream so

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
downstream continued to uh increase at

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
peak at 11

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
upstream increased by five percent

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
um what's really interesting in all of

181
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,520
that is that while

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
capacity continues to grow the customer

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
needs are still very much asymmetrical

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
okay there's a lot of

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
buzz around symmetry distance symmetry

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
that like but the reality of it is that

187
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
at the height of kovid

188
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
um and you see it you know here uh in

189
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,479
terms of the uh uh the the ratios at the

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
height of kovid we saw downstream to

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
upstream ratio be at 12.4

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
okay

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
in the second half of 21 as we kind of

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
all were coming out of our

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
sheltering in place that went back up to

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
over 14 to 1 which is where it was prior

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
to the pandemic okay and so the reality

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
of it is that the network is still

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,879
very much

200
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
a downstream delivery network

201
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
okay it's not to say that upstream is

202
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
not important it is

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
and we've seen some pretty significant

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
obviously traffic increases on the

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
upstream driven by video

206
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
telecommunications

207
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,280
but

208
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
um it's still very much driven by

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
downstream consumption primarily

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
entertainment services that's not a

211
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,599
surprise right and as you see those ott

212
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,639
services continue to proliferate um i

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
just so uh

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,680
a research note today tivo is saying

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
that the average consumer has nine

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,319
different

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,840
streaming services

218
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
uh unfortunately there's only 24 hours

219
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
in a day right so you know you just you

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
know there's a you know you reach a

221
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
substitutive effect in terms of what

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,559
they actually watch uh but those are the

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
growth rate that we uh you know we we

224
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,919
needed to accommodate and continue to

225
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
accommodate from a subscriber's

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
standpoint

227
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,000
um and then you know last but not least

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
um while video conferencing share of

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
peak network traffic

230
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
um

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,399
literally doubled during the pandemic

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,000
okay doubled one day uh it's still only

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
five percent actually less than five

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
percent of the total bits carried on the

235
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,519
network

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
okay now if this guy has anything to do

237
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,839
with it you know they'll uh you know

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
they'll uh you know we'll all be

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
broadcasting at 8k out of our home

240
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,920
but you know the reality is that you

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
know for the uh you know for the

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
current uh subscriber uh trajectory it's

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,240
you just put that into a perspective

244
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
okay

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,959
let's talk about you know what it means

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
to the network and what i try to show

247
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
here is both kind of the physical

248
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
topology but also the spectral topology

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
of what the comcast network uh uh

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
represents so 60 million homes the vast

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
majority of the network which i'll start

252
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
you know down below uh is rated at 750

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
megahertz of of spectral capacity okay

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,279
of which

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,080
the small part of which you see down

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
below on the left-hand side

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
between 5 and 42 megahertz is dedicated

258
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
to upstream

259
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
everything else is dedicated to

260
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,680
downstream and is really shared by the

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
various formats of docsis over cable

262
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
delivery

263
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,600
and traditional video channel deliveries

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
while all of our lineup does is carried

265
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
in ip we still deliver uh uh

266
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
channels to traditional set of boxes are

267
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,839
quant based

268
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,480
okay

269
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
um in terms of uh the physical plant you

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
know what what it looks like for

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
high-speed data delivery uh

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
traditionally we relied on separate pipe

273
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
delivery the cmts or the cable modem

274
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
termination system uh that delivers the

275
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
doxy signals uh to our high-speed data

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,399
subscribers and then all t the alt uh

277
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,000
the optical

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
equivalent of a cmts

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
that you know delivers uh services to

280
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,920
our fiber to the home subscribers okay

281
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
the vast majority of delivery is over

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
docsis but we do have parts of the

283
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
network that are fed with fiber

284
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,839
and what you see here is a typical cable

285
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
architecture which relies on analog

286
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,640
fiber

287
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
from the cmts which resides in a local

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
data center

289
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
typically closer to the subscriber

290
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,800
because of the analog optics limitations

291
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,480
feeding an analog node um uh the reason

292
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,079
for that is historical it's the

293
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
technology that existed when uh the

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
two-way cable plant was built uh and

295
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
then we used amplifiers to basically

296
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
amplify and extend the rf reach all the

297
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
way down to the home uh what you're

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
seeing here in cable lingo is something

299
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
called n plus five the node plus five

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
uh amplifiers on this cascade okay and

301
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
this is kind of a

302
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
what a traditional cable network

303
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,279
looks like

304
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
not just for comcast but you know among

305
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
our other cable brethrens

306
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,519
and the challenge with this is really

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
twofold right number one is

308
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,279
notice that while the network is

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,000
asymmetric uh there's obviously a very

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
small sliver of capacity that is

311
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
available to be sent upstream

312
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
those are not easy

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
things to fix because they're really

314
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
limited by

315
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,399
rated devices in the network that are

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,959
able to pass or not pass frequencies in

317
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,120
order to change the number of lanes that

318
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
are dedicated uh to uh uh to upstream

319
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
and downstream delivery okay

320
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,639
um we've spent a lot of time in and

321
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
great innovation led by dan rice who is

322
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,760
sitting right here on a platform called

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
octave which was rushed to market during

324
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,200
the pandemic and is really the first

325
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,639
time where we've implemented ai and ml

326
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
in live in real time across our network

327
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
in order to optimize the bit delivery to

328
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
the individual customers right because

329
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
network conditions vary across the board

330
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
uh the signal down to my house may be

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,240
impaired by lte interference so maybe

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
have you know i have a connector that

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
needs to be tightened up which is

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
sending

335
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,600
noise upstream and that may be impacting

336
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
the efficiency of the bits that i may be

337
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
able to deliver to home and so octave

338
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
which is the platform that we built is

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
able to make those decisions in real

340
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
time with real-time polling and so the

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
bit delivery down to dan rice's home may

342
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
be better than it is for me but we both

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,160
are getting the service that is

344
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
optimized to the then current network

345
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,920
conditions

346
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
okay um and and what we've done is we've

347
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
taken a smart network and we made it

348
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
brilliant and by doing that we were able

349
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
to generate another 45 percent of

350
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
capacity at the time that we needed it

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
the most by reliant on pure software

352
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,920
innovation uh so really exciting times

353
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,720
even doing pandemic okay

354
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
now the challenge that we have is analog

355
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,600
optics uh in a world of you know

356
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
everything digital uh a cmts which is an

357
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,279
appliance-based um architecture in a

358
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,959
world that is all web scale and web

359
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,760
speed how do we evolve uh the

360
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
architecture uh to uh to be able to

361
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
authorize the network challenge and

362
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
about five years ago i got this amazing

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
opportunity to really take this on at

364
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,120
comcast and lead this virtualization

365
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
transition

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
across the board so why don't we go to

367
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,240
the next slide please

368
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
and what you're seeing here is the

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,880
continuous uh evolution uh and

370
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
innovation on the access network and i'm

371
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
gonna start with the spectrum and you'll

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
see that uh what we're doing is we're

373
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,560
doing two things number one is we're

374
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
increasing the size of the pipe okay to

375
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,519
either one gigahertz or 1.2 gigahertz

376
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,120
why are we doing this because the

377
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
customer needs continue to evolve right

378
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,880
you know how do we continue to have the

379
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
pipe that is there whether the capacity

380
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
is needed today or whether it's going to

381
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
be needed 10 years from now right

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
those are very large lengthy uh upgrades

383
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
that we uh we need to go through

384
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
the second piece is that notice that

385
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
we're increasing the amount of capacity

386
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
that is dedicated to upstream by

387
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
executing on something called mid-split

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,440
okay uh there's an another split called

389
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
high split which extends the upstream

390
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
frequencies all the way up to 204

391
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
megahertz the reason why we chose a

392
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,880
mid-split is you see that garband that

393
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,079
white space uh in between uh it's there

394
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
you know so that we could continue to

395
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,639
deliver

396
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,480
video services to cable cards and other

397
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
retail devices uninterrupted

398
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,160
okay

399
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
um and it's really important for us that

400
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
as the network progresses we're not

401
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
interrupting uh or disrupting the

402
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,279
customer delivery uh from a service

403
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
standpoint even on legacy video quan

404
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
video not just legacy

405
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
um what we're also doing is that we're

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,480
virtualizing the entire delivery system

407
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
and so we have launched several years

408
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
ago what we call our virtual cmps

409
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,000
uh by disaggregating and separating the

410
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
hardware from the software we're able to

411
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,639
innovate in web scaling web speeds uh

412
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
we're running on intel-based platforms

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
instead of proprietary

414
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
appliances um you know put that in

415
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
perspective we're on our second

416
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
generation of that platform about to

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,079
transition to the third generation of

418
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
that platform um all riding on intel's

419
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,360
moore's law coattail

420
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
you know with uh

421
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,079
effectively

422
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,839
enabling to double the density and

423
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
capacity uh writing moore's law rather

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
than you know reliant on proprietary

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,720
chipset applications

426
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
um we're

427
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,440
transitioning to brand new digital um

428
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,920
fiber capabilities which enable us to

429
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
extend the distance um you know on the

430
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
physical plant which enables us to

431
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,839
invest

432
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,199
more

433
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
into what we call the critical

434
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
infrastructure how do we make sure that

435
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,000
we have backup power backup cooling back

436
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
up everything uh in a uh in a world

437
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,440
where the power grid is suffering from

438
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,199
the weather events that we uh you know

439
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,120
we all experience every day uh if you

440
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
walked outside you know today or

441
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
yesterday rather you'd understand what

442
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
i'm talking about

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
and then

444
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,839
the

445
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
amplifiers on the network are upgraded

446
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,120
in order to pass these additional

447
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
upstream capabilities to fully take

448
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
advantage of these speeds this is

449
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,119
something that we're doing

450
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,679
across our network right now

451
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,559
and working very hard because one it

452
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,400
enables us to literally triple the

453
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
amount of upstream capacity that we're

454
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,439
able to deliver

455
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,039
significantly increase

456
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
speeds in the upstream

457
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
and really drive

458
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
a lot more usage

459
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,280
if and when customers are going to

460
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
demand those

461
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
additional upstream services

462
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
driven by gaming or you know vr or

463
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
whatever it is that uh you know will

464
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,120
come

465
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,400
okay

466
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,520
um if we go to the next slide please

467
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
uh we're not done

468
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
right and when we say we're not done is

469
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,000
uh that's really a stepping stone into

470
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
evolving our network into what we call

471
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
boxes 4.0 uh in this case it's the full

472
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,880
duplex uh version of docsis 4.0 uh

473
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
there's an extended spectrum

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
optionality to

475
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
the docsis 4.0 spec

476
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,919
and what docsis 4.0 enables us to do is

477
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,919
deliver multiple gigabit symmetrical

478
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,120
services

479
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
on the same crossover network that we're

480
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
putting in place uh with our you know

481
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
our network rebuild

482
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,840
okay

483
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
and what's really exciting about this is

484
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
you know take a step back for the first

485
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,039
time we talked about the asymmetry and

486
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,600
the frequency dedication

487
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,760
or separation rather between upstream

488
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
and downstream and how much of the plant

489
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
is dedicated to downstream

490
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
what fdx

491
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,080
doxx4.fdx enables us to do is with

492
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
advancement in compute we're able to

493
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
overlay

494
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
i need you to mute

495
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
it's the story of my life the muting

496
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
you're mute

497
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
there you go um

498
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
so what uh

499
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
nope

500
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,120
no you're not a mute

501
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,360
[Laughter]

502
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,200
this

503
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,080
it's okay no problem um

504
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
it's uh it's it's it's the story of our

505
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
lives really over the last two and a

506
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
half years but that's why it's so great

507
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
to be here with you we could that we

508
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,240
could control that um so what

509
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,880
docsis4.ofdx does is enables to overlay

510
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
upstream and downstream frequencies

511
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
right on top of the other uh with uh

512
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
echo cancellation innovation which we're

513
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
working to uh develop and build uh into

514
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,559
the plant uh and be able to service

515
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
those multiple gigabit symmetrical

516
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
services on this

517
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
while still maintaining and you see it

518
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
you know down below all of the

519
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
subscribers that have equipment that is

520
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
not compatible with access 4.0 okay so

521
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
the mid-split modems will continue to

522
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,679
function the legacy video delivery will

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
continue to function and all of that

524
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,720
will be able to do on our coaxial cable

525
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
i had the privilege of demoing this

526
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
technology at cablelabs back in april

527
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,280
we were able to demonstrate nine

528
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,080
gigabits down in five gigabits up

529
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,799
uh on this uh under service uh and

530
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
what's really cool about this is with

531
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
the virtualization innovation uh that

532
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
you know we've uh worked on for the past

533
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
four or five years

534
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,360
we're able to do this is a software

535
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,159
download on the virtualized platform

536
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,600
okay

537
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,840
electronic upgrades to the nodes and the

538
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,799
amps and now you have a coaxial cable

539
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
plant where we're able to deliver

540
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
multiple gigabit symmetrical services

541
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
without needing to dig up everyone's

542
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,559
front yards and everyone's sidewalks and

543
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
an eight hour fiber installation and

544
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
everything else that

545
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
some of our fiber veterans are dealing

546
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
with

547
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
that's the innovation that is the

548
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
comcast commitment

549
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,200
uh to continuous

550
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
investment in the network in our

551
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
technology and into products and

552
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,919
services that our customers uh continue

553
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,720
to demand of us as technology continues

554
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
to evolve

555
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
super exciting uh to see it happening uh

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,320
but we're not done there uh let's go to

557
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
the next slide please

558
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
i talked earlier about um

559
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
the low latency delivery and what we do

560
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
what we've done

561
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
in terms of active queue management

562
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
during the height of the pandemic and

563
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,039
how and again then rice's team here

564
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,480
really helped us to uh optimize the cmts

565
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
delivery configurations so that we don't

566
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
just take care of capacity and we don't

567
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
just take care of speed yes we deliver

568
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
gigabit services to more customers than

569
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
anyone else

570
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,840
anyone

571
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,960
else speed is one element uh the actual

572
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
effectiveness of the bit delivery is as

573
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
critical

574
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
and we have some pretty pioneering work

575
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,600
that is already underway uh in terms of

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
docsis 3.1 low latency implementation

577
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
both on the network and on the wi-fi

578
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,799
side of things so that we could deliver

579
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,840
end-to-end low-latency

580
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,960
docsis delivery sub 10 milliseconds

581
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
across our entire network

582
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
and be able to do that in in great scale

583
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
so pretty exciting innovative work still

584
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,080
ahead of us i haven't even talked about

585
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
how the same virtualized platform

586
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
effectively

587
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
abstracts the wire delivery and so i

588
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
mentioned earlier the fiber to the home

589
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
delivery that we have

590
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,400
and we with the virtualized platform and

591
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,080
the distributed access architecture that

592
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,480
we put in place we're able to deliver

593
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,159
those multiple gigabit symmetrical

594
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
surfaces on whether the fiber is coaxial

595
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,720
or whether the fiber is fiber

596
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,640
or whether the wire is fiber

597
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
because again the customers don't care

598
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
whether there's clocks in the black

599
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,120
wire or whether there is um a glass in

600
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,039
the black wire they want to make sure

601
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,720
that the products and services that they

602
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,559
rely on uh they continue to uh to deploy

603
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,280
uh with the virtualized architecture

604
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
with the digital connection

605
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
uh what i

606
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
am emotionally excited about

607
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
is the real-time visibility and the

608
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,360
real-time traceability that we have to

609
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
the service end-to-end it's a digital

610
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,640
connection

611
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
it's now doesn't rely on polling

612
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,000
technology anymore it actually streams

613
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,360
the real-time customer experience across

614
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,240
this network uh in real time so that we

615
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,039
could

616
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
act on it you know i mentioned the

617
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,280
octave um

618
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
ai engine that we built uh for bit

619
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,440
optimization

620
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
imagine if you will the same thing for

621
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,520
fiber connectivity imagine the same

622
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,159
thing for rf impairments on the network

623
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,000
that may or may not be disrupting

624
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
customers

625
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
imagine if you will service

626
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
interruptions where we're able to detect

627
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
in five seconds uh instead of you know

628
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
polling technology which is ultimately

629
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,000
limited by at the cpu and the appliance

630
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
and so on and so forth and so

631
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,400
this architecture beyond the fact that

632
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
it's going to be faster beyond the fact

633
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
that it's going to deliver low latency

634
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,240
like no other uh is truly extensive it's

635
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
truly

636
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
broadly deployed uh you know we don't

637
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
dig this side of the street or that side

638
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,279
of the street all of our customers are

639
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,440
able to experience gigabit speeds today

640
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
and they'll be able to experience even

641
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,559
better in the future

642
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,600
so

643
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,919
that's my uh my story for the uh for the

644
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
path of 10g

645
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
um and i'll pause here and i'm happy to

646
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
take any questions that you uh you may

647
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
have whether it's uh here in a room and

648
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
let me start in a room uh and then uh

649
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
you know we could uh you know uh jump in

650
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,480
and take any virtual questions let's do

651
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,799
it go ahead

652
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
okay that's better

653
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,919
i don't have a question i just came up

654
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,200
to thank you

655
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
for your presentation

656
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
to thank comcast for its ongoing support

657
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
of the ietf

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
to thank all the comcast engineers like

659
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
jason livengood and others that i work

660
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
with for

661
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
the amazing work you do

662
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
being on the forefront

663
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,200
of creating new technology and i'm not

664
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
going to name other names but there are

665
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,679
other isps and operators who are not

666
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,559
here

667
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,360
who are very clearly playing catch up

668
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
and five years from now they'll be

669
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,279
finally figuring out what you're doing

670
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
and realizing why they're falling behind

671
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,279
so wonderful work that you're doing well

672
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,760
it means a lot coming from you

673
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
personally um it means a lot you know

674
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
for me

675
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,279
uh is having the opportunity to lead

676
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,799
this team through this transition

677
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,840
because

678
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
this is not easy

679
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,320
okay this is not uh and when you're in

680
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,799
the sphere of technology you know guess

681
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,720
what you know the first year and a half

682
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
of working through the the virtualized

683
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
platform

684
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
we did not sleep honestly

685
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
um because uh because you know it looks

686
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,799
great on powerpoint

687
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
right but when you try and put this in

688
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
front of paying subscribers you run into

689
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
you know any possible corner case you

690
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
may uh run into and obstructing hardware

691
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,400
from software uh you know really um

692
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,679
is uh

693
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,320
is easy to say on powerpoint it's not

694
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,120
easy to do in practice uh but with all

695
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
the lessons learned um i'm so proud to

696
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
see what the team was able to accomplish

697
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,919
um and you see that with the millions of

698
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,760
subscribers that are on this uh platform

699
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,840
right now so it really means the world

700
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
to us it really does thank you

701
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
thank you and i just realized poor

702
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
microphone etiquette i didn't say who i

703
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
am uh this is stuart cheshire from apple

704
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,840
thank you thank

705
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,480
you and we have one uh in the queue uh

706
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,919
yoshido asks if we are providing ipv6 to

707
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
customers yet and if so um what sort of

708
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,200
size prefix length do we provide that's

709
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
a shoe in for you because you know

710
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
you've launched ipv6

711
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,279
the answer is yes we do and uh generally

712
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,159
uh 56 or 60 uh yeah

713
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,320
and and and i would say what's really

714
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
what really makes the comcast network

715
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
unique is not only are we providing ipv6

716
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
we're providing ipv6 multicast on the

717
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,120
video side which uh you know um

718
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
it's quite the complication from a

719
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
delivery standpoint

720
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,679
uh it is a very very unique uh comcast

721
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,640
case

722
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
uh because uh

723
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
you know when you look at uh some of the

724
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
third-party applications you know at the

725
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
the nos level it's uh it's not a

726
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
requirement that is uh

727
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,960
very broadly adopted uh you know across

728
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,760
the uh the industry at large

729
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,520
we had to do it because of the way our

730
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,559
video delivery pipeline is

731
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,440
any other questions

732
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,480
so uh my name is amir brijandi so sorry

733
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,919
go right up to the mic so the stream can

734
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
hear you uh can you hear me perfect yeah

735
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
so amir virginia so um i so you actually

736
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,520
did a very good like interesting job and

737
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
like you know congratulations are you

738
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,760
looking to expand this sort of work like

739
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,279
you know to other parts of the network

740
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,360
because this is one small i mean it's

741
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,799
not a small section but it's one part of

742
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
the network so

743
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,000
wow

744
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
small

745
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,159
i i heard it

746
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
so

747
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,399
um the short answer is yes but let me

748
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,480
give you the long answer too okay

749
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
um we don't do technology for the sake

750
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,840
of technology

751
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,919
we don't right you know as much as you

752
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,520
know engineers like to do that that is

753
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,080
not uh that is a means to an end in the

754
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
end here is a customer experience it's

755
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
reliability it's the scalability or

756
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
continuous scalability

757
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,120
and continuous growth of the network

758
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,000
okay

759
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
uh when you look at the

760
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
other side of the network

761
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,279
um

762
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,919
the smaller side of the network uh the

763
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,240
core network um is uh i'm just joking um

764
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
the the

765
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,919
uh

766
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,760
when you look at the core delivery right

767
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
the core delivery today uh very much uh

768
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,840
relies on

769
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,720
appliances up and down uh the delivery

770
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
for various historical reasons right uh

771
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
you know this is being a vendor-led

772
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,760
vendor-driven

773
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
industry that had very little incentive

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,360
to innovate

775
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,799
disrupt

776
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,679
okay

777
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,440
um and you know it served

778
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
extraordinarily well

779
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
and continues to serve extraordinarily

780
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
well uh but i look at some of the work

781
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,440
that for example 18t has done uh in

782
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,480
terms of of uh

783
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,520
virtualizing their core network um and

784
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
driving uh both uh asic and nos

785
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
diversity uh onto the core network i

786
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
look at the progressions uh in photonics

787
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,480
across uh the transport layer

788
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,399
and when you see innovations like zero

789
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,720
optics and others you begin to uh to

790
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
come in and how those get paired with

791
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
the aggregation routers um and

792
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,600
you know

793
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,360
the two coming together

794
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
i think that there's tremendous

795
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,120
opportunity in the core network

796
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,200
we are actively looking at you know what

797
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,279
the right

798
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,480
technology decisions are for us

799
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,399
but again to me

800
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,559
beyond the technology choices and beyond

801
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,960
the hardware and software abstraction

802
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,320
to me it's the real-time visibility uh

803
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,440
and how for example we rely on gnmi in

804
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
great scale right not just at the access

805
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
layer not just at the you know close to

806
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
the customer but really up and down uh

807
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,240
and be able to rely on on real-time

808
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,520
streaming real-time alarming and

809
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,240
real-time telemetry to start to really

810
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,039
drive ai at a grand scale across all of

811
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,039
that uh and that's something that we are

812
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,000
looking into and a lot more to come so

813
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
can i add the second question yeah yeah

814
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,720
yeah

815
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,320
so um first of all i didn't mean to say

816
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,919
so i just said like one portion of the

817
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,360
network maybe that would be hurt my

818
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
feelings it's too much i'm sorry

819
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
just allocate that english as a second

820
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
language so um

821
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
but uh so you actually bring a very good

822
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
point of like you know ai so industry is

823
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,399
talking about self-healing networks for

824
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,240
a while all that stuff that comes into

825
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
picture is that something that do you

826
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,840
think would

827
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,039
eventually i mean

828
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,399
and everyone's talking about it for the

829
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,480
last like you know six seven years so

830
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,159
where do you see in your opinion where

831
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
that would you think the self-healing

832
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,360
network would we will see that in the

833
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,919
next couple of years or it's a ten-year

834
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,039
so so i will tell you uh that again with

835
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,080
the octave example as it is right now

836
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,519
right we are

837
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
uh effectively modulating around network

838
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
impairments as we speak millions of

839
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
times a day today okay

840
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,799
um and nuts on the uh you know the

841
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,120
access network uh without going into too

842
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,159
many details uh at this point

843
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,720
we have a platform that we call net iq

844
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,960
uh which uh you know operates uh you

845
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
could check it out online we actually

846
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,519
have a you know a couple postings or not

847
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,279
that does that on the core but we're

848
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,360
just getting started the real power here

849
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,799
is how do you connect all of them

850
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,799
together because

851
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
you know picture if you will you know

852
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,640
the following um

853
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,519
i have four boys uh two were in college

854
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,360
doing the pandemic and came back home

855
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,480
because

856
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,000
you know that they closed it and then

857
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
two are still in school

858
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
uh and 15 seconds after the internet

859
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,519
goes offline

860
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,760
one of them at a minimum is in my home

861
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,919
office by letting me know that the

862
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,600
internet is down

863
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
they're like internet probes it's great

864
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
okay

865
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,919
um

866
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,039
and and now the real question becomes

867
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
where in your network is the impairment

868
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,840
where in the one point you know

869
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,440
something million

870
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,279
miles of cable okay fiber or clocks the

871
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,640
impairment is

872
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,600
okay

873
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,840
and the problem is you're dealing with

874
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
kind of you know vertical appliances is

875
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
that they don't care across very well

876
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,760
right

877
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,200
but if for example the issue was i had a

878
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,000
big

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
um local metro area fiber cut

880
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,240
okay um if you everyone i'm sure is

881
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,159
called their cable company to try and

882
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,360
get service and the first thing the

883
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,600
unhold message tells you is reboot your

884
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
modem

885
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
okay well you could reboot your model a

886
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,440
thousand times if there's a fiber cut to

887
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
your area that's not going to help

888
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,440
right and so how do we de-duplicate the

889
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,799
alarms because think about the alarms

890
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,399
that when it just went off in our

891
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
network the cable modems were streaming

892
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,600
that they lost connection okay the smart

893
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,559
network the amplifiers the nodes uh and

894
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,039
uh the vcnps said

895
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,320
we're not getting traffic it's not

896
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,000
coming through okay

897
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,039
the local network said well i lost

898
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,320
something northbound um and now it's how

899
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,640
do you shoot the fiber uh in order with

900
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
an otdr in order to pinpoint exactly

901
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,760
where the fiber

902
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,679
disconnect is and that's what we're

903
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,440
working on right now how do you tie all

904
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,080
of these indicators together uh into a

905
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
coherent

906
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
alarm that only pinpoints where the

907
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
breakage point is

908
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
but also then

909
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,399
has the intelligence to message to our

910
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,600
customers

911
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,919
what their expectations are

912
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,600
okay and so it's not just about the

913
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
self-healingness of this is what do you

914
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
tell the end customer okay don't reboot

915
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,079
your modem there's a fiber cut in your

916
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,199
area

917
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,359
fiber crews are aware of the issue and

918
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,679
are working to restore service the eta

919
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,399
is four hours

920
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,639
and that ultimately is is what the

921
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,719
network goal is

922
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,800
right because that's what our customers

923
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
expect of us

924
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
and that's what we're working on thank

925
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,119
you so much

926
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,159
any other questions

927
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,079
i got that one already yeah next

928
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,960
question yeah please

929
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,199
uh hello i'm robert jackson so i have a

930
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,440
question do you have numbers of your tcp

931
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,839
versus udp traffic percentages lately

932
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,599
and is it affecting your

933
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,159
engineering of the network in any way

934
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,839
i don't think we uh

935
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,520
yeah i don't think we've uh shared any

936
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,359
of those stats but yeah we're watching

937
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,119
closely you know what's happening with

938
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,200
the quick and uh all these kinds of

939
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
things i don't think yet it's changed

940
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
the way that we do engineering yeah

941
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,760
you know all ip

942
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,480
that's exactly right

943
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,119
okay any uh any other questions from

944
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,119
anyone

945
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
any other questions online

946
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
i don't see any more online is there

947
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,800
another one

948
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
yeah oh sorry i

949
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
i don't see the same screen

950
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,160
uh maybe the person that's online can uh

951
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,040
we lost the media echo here uh maybe the

952
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
person online can uh ask your question

953
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
go off mute

954
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
sharon

955
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,359
yes hi this is sharon

956
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,000
um i'm thinking about

957
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,599
a very large upstream application with

958
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,040
connected cars

959
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,000
hitting

960
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,720
a

961
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,599
access network uh wall

962
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,440
with cellular

963
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,280
is there any thought of

964
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
combining docsis with wireless lan in

965
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
order to

966
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,760
free up this jam

967
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,079
any plans any thought about it

968
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,400
thank you

969
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,240
um

970
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
so uh sean it's a it's a good question

971
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,079
um let me let me answer it this way okay

972
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,280
comcast is not a wireless company we do

973
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
offer cellular services but they're

974
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,920
through an nvno with verizon we do have

975
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
a very very large wi-fi

976
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
network uh in fact it's the largest in

977
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,320
the us uh which we use for you know both

978
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
you know customer benefits but also as a

979
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,640
way to offload um uh solar minutes um

980
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,160
and uh you know help with the economics

981
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
of the nvnl

982
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,359
as such and really driven by that

983
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,560
obviously

984
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,079
you know what's right for the comcast

985
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
network you know may be different than

986
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,200
companies like uh rogers that is

987
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,079
actually a wireless carrier uh and has

988
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,320
you know a tighter integration and so

989
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
sean i really think that the answer to

990
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
your question is probably but it really

991
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,599
depends on the actual um operator and

992
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,040
the the unique services that they

993
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
provide

994
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,119
okay

995
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
any other questions

996
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
yes

997
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
last one and then uh

998
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
and then we'll wrap up yeah we'll wrap

999
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
up sorry not a question about a comment

1000
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,760
uh jason tucker from comcast

1001
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
following up on ipv6 question from

1002
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,280
earlier

1003
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
not only are we delivering ipv6 to

1004
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,040
customers but we were doing it at a

1005
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,280
large scale like 10 years ago so ipv6 is

1006
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
it's really integral to what we do at a

1007
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,880
lot of levels yeah totally and has been

1008
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,599
and and you're you're 100 right um and

1009
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,119
jason thank you

1010
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,160
um

1011
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,599
i would say you know last comment on

1012
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,880
this uh on the ipv6 uh pieces

1013
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,040
um

1014
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
it's so ingrained to everything that we

1015
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
do from a network standpoint we could

1016
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,079
not scale at some point we were the

1017
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,440
largest consumer of ipv4 addresses uh

1018
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,520
and and we literally hit a wall so you

1019
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,599
know this has been a uh

1020
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,280
instrumental for us you know to your

1021
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
point for many many years yes last one

1022
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
and then they kicked me out hi paul

1023
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
curtis sienna um

1024
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
in talking about the monitoring and

1025
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,359
troubleshooting you mentioned gnmi i

1026
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,599
guess i'm curious to the extent you're

1027
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,400
using

1028
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,280
gnmi just for monitoring also for all

1029
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
network management and if there's

1030
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
anything you can say about your progress

1031
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,480
there where you guys are at and rolling

1032
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,839
that out

1033
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,280
yeah so

1034
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
um

1035
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,320
i'm trying to think what i could say i

1036
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,960
could say that um i could say this um

1037
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,440
we're very excited about the fact that

1038
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,079
it is a common standard uh even though

1039
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,560
every vendor siena has a you know

1040
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,839
different implementation of gnmi right

1041
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,240
um you know same for the nokia person

1042
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
you know back there and and so on and so

1043
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
forth okay and so part of an operator

1044
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,640
challenge is what pieces of it can you

1045
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,720
take that you could fairly standardize

1046
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,240
that you could then feed across you know

1047
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
this average ecosystem that you could

1048
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,480
actually act and and operationalize

1049
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
because at the end of the day you know

1050
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
think about the the ops people that at 2

1051
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,160
a.m need to get an alarm and do

1052
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,400
something with it okay

1053
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
and that's where you know the challenge

1054
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,400
has been i want to say that uh in parts

1055
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,839
of the network we're further along in

1056
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,079
some parts of the network we have um you

1057
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,760
know we're just big in the beginning

1058
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,400
stages of this um but again it's

1059
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,960
exciting uh to be able to uh to leverage

1060
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
a uh you know a common spec across these

1061
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,079
as we're uh maturing uh the actual

1062
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,200
delivery

1063
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
does that make sense

1064
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
thank you

1065
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
okay great well thank you very much a

1066
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
lot appreciate it thank you for having

1067
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
me

1068
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
thank you for coming here and again

1069
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,200
thank you for uh for your uh thought and

1070
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,119
technology leadership we we could not

1071
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,440
have done any of this without the great

1072
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,880
work that you're doing across the

1073
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,520
industry so thank you

1074
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
thank you so

1075
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:39,839
so much

1076
