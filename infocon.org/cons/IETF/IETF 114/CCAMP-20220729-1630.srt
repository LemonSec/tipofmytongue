43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,919

participants

46
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
so uh there are some tips for the uh

47
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
on-site you know our participants

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,199
uh

49
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
first we have to make sure to sign into

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440

51
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
with echo and also use the mid anchor to

52
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
join the mic q

53
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
and especially please keep audio and the

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
video off if not used on site version

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
and the last one is very important

56
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,639
because it is relevant to our health so

57
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,759
uh please

58
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,639
wear

59
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
masks

60
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
unless when you're speaking at the mic

61
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
and

62
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,440
so the remote participants we also uh

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
have to make sure your audio and the

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
radio

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
are off unless you are speaking you are

66
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
you know chilling or presenting

67
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,440
something

68
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,919
uh to avoid you know our internet

69
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,639
bandwidth competition and also we

70
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
recommend to use a kind of you know

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,520
headset you know to to make you are much

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
clearer

73
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,199
next

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
and there are some

75
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
information about this meeting like

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,639
agenda in the mid echo you can just you

77
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,520
know open the links

78
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,919
next

79
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
so and there is also some contact and

80
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
guidelines i think this is more like a

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
kind of supplement supplement to the you

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
know load wheel

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
this thing's more described in the bcp

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
54

85
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
in sudbury uh

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
it says that anyway we should you know

87
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
be polite

88
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,880
and you know respect each other at all

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
times i think this is quite very

90
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
important no personal attack

91
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,160
we can only just focus on the you know

92
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
uh technical stuff

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
next

94
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,720
and for session this time we have only

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
one session with two hours

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
actually i don't think the time is you

97
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
know are friendlier for the especially

98
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
for the mode participant for the asian

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
people but also it's not friendly for

100
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,160
the you know uh

101
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
in in-person participants because this

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,919
is friday afternoon maybe some you know

103
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,759
in person participants may leave for

104
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
home at this time

105
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,199
okay

106
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
next

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
so this agenda

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
so this time we have my um you know our

109
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
plantation

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,440
uh presentations

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,919
so uh this year a kind of you know a

112
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,400
visa agenda so let's follow the agenda

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
and let's have a you know an efficient

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,120
discussion

115
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,360
so uh

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
administrative actually uh we are using

117
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
the mid echo i think we know how to use

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,800
it

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
yeah next

120
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
so uh for the meet takers i think you

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
know how men can help us

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,639
but i'm not sure or sky is key or not it

123
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,280
seems oscar you know uh

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
is not

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
in the

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
meeting

127
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
so uh anyway if anyone you know i could

128
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
you know capture something slow on my uh

129
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,319
tour

130
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
that will be a much appreciated but

131
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
anyway i asked how many to help the

132
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
children

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
blushes

134
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,039
so uh anyway

135
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
this will be uh automatically uh created

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
based on your you know mid echo

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
information not information

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
uh so no need to do anything

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
and for the ipr process

140
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
though this is quite very important

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,880
reminder about the ipr process so

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
usually you know prior to moving to the

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
next step in the working group process

144
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
uh the the chairs we are sending the ipr

145
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,240
polling and then uh which requires the

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
authors and the contributors of a draft

147
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
to respond to ipr polling as soon as

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
possible

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
otherwise it may delay your draft to

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
move forward quickly

151
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
next

152
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,800
so uh another reminder about the main

153
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
list

154
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,240
we always you know are encouraged

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
working group to use the many list as

156
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
much as possible and we can

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
for example discuss any open issues to

158
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
some drafts and also we can introduce

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
some new drafts and to attract more you

160
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
know interest from the working group and

161
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,120
also we could you know uh introduce or

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
discuss some potential on new topics

163
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,320
after our seacam

164
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
and also uh be aware that working group

165
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,080
consensus is determined on the main list

166
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
even though if we you know get some

167
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
consensus in during the meeting but we

168
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
still need to bring to the uh list for

169
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,839
confirmation

170
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
next

171
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,079
okay it's for you daniele

172
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
okay let's see if it works

173
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,200
so a brief update

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
on the document on

175
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
the status of the documents of the

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
working group actually we have two

177
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,519
documents in the isg processing

178
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
the

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
applicability of gmp ls to ot on rtn

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
beyond 100 gigabits

181
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
and which which has been there for a

182
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
while now and the recently

183
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
pushed

184
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,079
young model for flexibility the topology

185
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
i would like to thank sadrian once again

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
for uh

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,760
volunteering to be the shepherd for this

188
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,439
for both of the documents actually

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,519
we have five working group documents uh

190
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,720
on agenda

191
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
we have the microwave topology young

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,079
model

193
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,519
uh the

194
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
young model for otn slicing

195
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,380
the young model for layer 1

196
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,839
[Music]

197
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
service models

198
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,560
um

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
the

200
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
it's all young models basically the

201
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
optical impairment topology and the rfc

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
1993 visa

203
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,480
then

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
we

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
we are running the apr polling for the

206
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
layer one types and the otna topology

207
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
young

208
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
if i'm not mistaken we received all the

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
replies uh for the layer one types

210
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
but we are still missing uh two or three

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
of them for dft and topology so

212
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
please um answer

213
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
to the to the polling as soon as

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
possible so that we can start

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
the working group last call we would

216
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,440
like to to run a joint last call for for

217
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,079
both of the documents

218
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:08,959
then

219
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,800
we have

220
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,680
the otn the tunnel model

221
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,560
these this one has been updated

222
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
with consistent description on

223
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,279
terminologies tree diagram and graphic

224
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
and graphics

225
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
it's technically stable

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,399
uh

227
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,720
i mean uh the authors said that they are

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
trying to keep in alignment with with

229
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
the generic

230
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
uh model actually this is this is one of

231
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
the many documents that have

232
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
dependencies on the

233
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
itft document from fronties

234
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
we have also the transport ndi

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
applicability stick statement this is a

236
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,959
document that already went through the

237
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
working group last call

238
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,680
all the comments have been been

239
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,519
addressed

240
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,480
this is a pretty long and extensive

241
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
document we tried

242
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
to

243
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,440
reduce a little bit we uh we reviewed it

244
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
uh trying to

245
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,040
cut some uh some fat and just leave with

246
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,079
the meat

247
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,519
around the bones

248
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,200
uh i don't know if uh italo or dan

249
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
have some updates on the progresses on

250
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
the progresses of uh

251
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,480
of the diet of the document

252
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
please

253
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
or or done if if you can hear us

254
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,040
okay please

255
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
i don't know i don't see that so well we

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
have looked at your suggestions and we

257
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,839
are going to review the document and

258
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,959
update

259
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
based on on your suggestions

260
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
but we still need to do the work

261
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
okay okay

262
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
i mean at least

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
you're fine with them that's a really

264
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
good starting point

265
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
moving on to the other documents these

266
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,839
ones

267
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
are

268
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
so we have the client signal young model

269
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
uh there is a number of pending issues

270
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,959
resilience port layer

271
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,240
etc uh the the authors are working on

272
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
that then we have a set of uh

273
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,199
documents which is uh moving a little

274
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
bit slow but i mean i i fully understand

275
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
that because we have a fairly reduced

276
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
number

277
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
of authors

278
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
which is working on many documents in

279
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
parallel and

280
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
it's of course some of them

281
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,839
are

282
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
are progressed with the low priorities

283
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
we are speaking here about the

284
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,279
um dwdm interface lmp extensions

285
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,760
but if i'm not mistaken this is already

286
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
applicable also to the dwdm interface

287
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
parameter young model

288
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
then we have the

289
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,920
flexi

290
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,959
the young model for flex internet which

291
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
was recently adopted

292
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
there was a quite quite good support but

293
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
after the adoption

294
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
no big changes uh uh

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
uh on

296
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
on the documents so a little bit more

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,440
more discussion and the more review from

298
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,079
from from the entire working group

299
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
would be would be great

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,639
then we have two documents the basically

301
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
the tunnel model for wson and for

302
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,120
flexigreeta these are both

303
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,519
pretty stable documents they've been out

304
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,800
for a while

305
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,120
both of them are blocked by the itf te

306
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,680
model uh

307
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,399
we were considering to merge the the two

308
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,759
documents since

309
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,680
both of them uh

310
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
have uh

311
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
common layer zero attributes so i mean

312
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,160
this is something that we would like to

313
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
to to discuss

314
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,000
to to to reduce uh

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
the effort from from the sg from the

316
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
reviewers to

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
analyze a single document instead

318
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,399
instead of two

319
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,160
finally we have liaisons and

320
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,320
communication we have two of them one

321
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,199
from

322
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
the etsy isg

323
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
uh

324
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,440
this is a a follow-up

325
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,199
on the a

326
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
young modeling for sdn sbi

327
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
this is mostly focused on microwave if

328
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
if i'm not mistaken

329
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,600
and this uh the deletion is to announce

330
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
the next uh

331
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,320
round of applause test

332
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,880
arranged by etsy you can find the uh

333
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
the link

334
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
to the

335
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
to the liaison here but you can find it

336
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,480
also on on the mailing list this was

337
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
just for information we have also

338
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
another liaison which which we received

339
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,480
a couple of days ago so pretty fresh i

340
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
i i just scanned through through it

341
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
uh this is uh a liaison an invitation to

342
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,240
update the information the imt 2022 and

343
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
beyond roadmap so if if you're

344
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
interested you can find a link

345
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,839
to that as well here and on the main

346
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,159

347
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
if there is

348
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,280
no comment i would

349
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,439
move to the first presentation

350
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
which is the uh

351
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
young data model for microwave topology

352
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
if i'm not mistaken scott is presenting

353
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
it

354
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
hello can you hear me all right out

355
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
there in yes

356
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
chair land okay great well welcome

357
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
everyone to the um

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,720
yang session for c camp it seems to be

359
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
something that's very popular these days

360
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
what i'm here to do is just to present

361
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
very uh very quickly a update on where

362
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
we are with the microwave topology yang

363
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,039
it's work that's been going on for a

364
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
while we have a team the team that's up

365
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
on there that are the authors of the

366
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,679
of this update

367
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,000
to the draft are ones that we

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
participate in conference calls like

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
every two weeks

370
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
so if you're interested in this work we

371
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
do have a lot of conversations so please

372
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
join those if you go to the next slide

373
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
please

374
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,360
so the status is very simple we've uh

375
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
we've taken the work that we were doing

376
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
before and we've migrated it all to

377
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
github we're using the uh the github

378
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,559
templates from i think it's martin

379
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,960
thompson and so we're using that to

380
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
track our issues so if you're interested

381
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
in this go there and you can

382
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
see where we are and see the latest

383
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,559
drafts

384
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,640
we had minor changes very minor changes

385
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
to the yang module

386
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
we've completed the

387
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
topology model figures fixed and

388
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,799
validated things we've added some

389
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,200
instance data and this is from then

390
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
from daniella she did she did a great

391
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
job on producing some some more examples

392
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
so that you can see instance data and

393
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,200
how it how it is used and we validated

394
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
that using tools like in yanglin so if

395
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,919
you go to next slide

396
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
the so what do we have for issues so if

397
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,799
you're interested in some of the issues

398
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,320
that we're currently still working

399
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,679
through and there's some tweaks around

400
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,840
bandwidth utilization and there's a

401
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,240
pointer to the issue and an issue around

402
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
operational mode and this is something

403
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
where

404
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
we're trying to decide how to model the

405
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,559
operational mode and trying to decide if

406
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
we need to update the 8561

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
to support a different way of of

408
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
supporting uh operational mode so if

409
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
you're interested in that

410
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
i have a private draft that i've started

411
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
it's not public yet at all there's no

412
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
zero zero or anything yet

413
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,559
but there is a um

414
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
github for that as well if you're

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
interested in looking what we're

416
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,719
thinking of doing there next slide

417
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
the liaison that um daniella just to

418
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,840
talk about is this etsy liaison from the

419
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
microwave working group this is this

420
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
provides a little more background on it

421
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
and if you're interested in this i like

422
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
this type of work because they're using

423
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
the yang that the it the ietf creates

424
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
they're using it in plug fests and

425
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,120
actually validating that it works and

426
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,919
finding issues and reporting back and

427
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,840
those are all very useful things so

428
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
there is a new an

429
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
invitation here on what they're going to

430
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,840
be doing next year so if you're

431
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,280
interested in this kind of work

432
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
especially around topology or around

433
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
configuration microwave that's what this

434
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
is about

435
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
you can find more work there and find

436
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
background there so go next slide please

437
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
we're going to try to get the draft we

438
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,200
want to get all of our issues done and

439
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
and get all that stuff done and try to

440
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
get a last call by next ietf

441
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
next slide i think that's it

442
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,360
is it the big thank you slide or is it

443
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
the big empty slide i don't know what's

444
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
next

445
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
none of them

446
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
none of them okay so it's uh so we have

447
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
adrian in the queue and adrian's in the

448
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
room

449
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,000
thank you

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
so much we're in the room but we've only

451
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
got one functioning microphone between

452
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,520
us hi this is adrian

453
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
uh i'm standing here looking at scott

454
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,159
which is kind of surreal for an online

455
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
meeting

456
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,159
um so thank you for uh re-spinning this

457
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,480
this draft uh um

458
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,039
and i i know you do all the work in

459
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
github and and so on could you do me a

460
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
favor and try to keep it alive going

461
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
forward as um

462
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
because it's really hard as you say when

463
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
when people outside

464
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
are picking up this stuff to use

465
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,400
and they can't quite tell whether we've

466
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
abandoned microwave or not i've been

467
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,080
fielding questions on that

468
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,559
oh thank you very much for that yes uh

469
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,200
one thing that we're trying to do is

470
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,840
do a lot more with our with our meetings

471
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,280
and and

472
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,159
publicize this using the github tooling

473
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
but something that uh we should do more

474
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,320
of is when we have a meeting we do put

475
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
the minutes in github but we should do a

476
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,919
better job of putting it out on the

477
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,520
mailing list as well that would help

478
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,880
people see

479
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
that the work is still progressing

480
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,559
especially if we're trying to get to

481
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,120
last call by next meeting we need to

482
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,520
start doing these last two issues and

483
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
make sure that the mailing list sees the

484
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,000
work as well that's a really good input

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,520
appreciate that

486
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,280
anything else i don't see anyone else

487
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,159
request for ties requesting the floor go

488
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
ahead

489
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
so i have can you hear me

490
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
yes

491
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,600
okay i just have one you know open

492
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
question for discussion so so far

493
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,559
actually there are two drafts about

494
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
young models for microville one is uh

495
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
this draft about microwave topology

496
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
another one is i've seen

497
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,799
85 61 about the young mod for microwave

498
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,600
interface so i'm wondering

499
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,559
yeah i'm wondering if if it needs a

500
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,280
draft to define young models for

501
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,559
forthano stuff like otn tunnel or you

502
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,840
know double sun tunnel

503
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
well that's uh

504
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
i'm going to answer it the way a good

505
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
chair would answer that if there if you

506
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
feel that there's work that's necessary

507
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,159
in that area please submit a individual

508
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,039
draft and then we'll look at

509
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,520
at doing that work i i think that

510
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
there's the the work to be a little more

511
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
serious in my answer the way that we're

512
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
trying to do this work is

513
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,720
we're trying to do it in a very modular

514
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,360
way so that if people want to have

515
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
things that run over top of this it's

516
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
easy to to

517
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,679
create augmentations that will then you

518
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
do the other the the new functionality

519
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
so hopefully that answers the question

520
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,679
in a sensible way thanks

521
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,720
okay thank you yeah

522
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,159
all right thanks everyone

523
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,679
thank you scott

524
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,600
well actually i didn't have the feeling

525
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,039
that this work was uh was stopped

526
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,799
probably because i was following

527
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
following the the minutes on on github

528
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,559
etc but

529
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,840
adriana raised a very good point

530
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,039
um sending a link to the list would

531
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,480
would be definitely helpful

532
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
well my my response to that is just

533
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,679
because i'm on the floor and nobody's

534
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,200
requested it yet

535
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
i think that it is very useful

536
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
to remind people to do this sort of

537
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,240
thing to continue the discussion on the

538
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
mailing list is even if you're using

539
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
github to make sure that the entire

540
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,120
working group

541
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,559
knows what's going on so thank you

542
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,840
yeah definitely

543
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,879
next one

544
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
hello

545
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
um danielle you wanted me to control it

546
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
or you can help me control the slide

547
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
i can do that for you

548
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,679
okay perfect um so hi everyone um my

549
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,120
name is iowa and i'm here presenting the

550
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
second dra revision of the

551
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,000
draft for

552
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
the framework and data model for otn

553
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
slicing um we have the co-authors and

554
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,880
the contributors on next slides

555
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,960
okay so since the

556
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
last revisioning um

557
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
becoming the working group of draft

558
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,880
we have updated both uh the text

559
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
as well as the yam data model for otn

560
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
slicing um so on the

561
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
text side

562
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
the the main change

563
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
is that we added a section

564
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
that describes

565
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,559
the realization of ogn slices with the

566
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,440
network resource petition um

567
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,919
along with other cosmetic updates

568
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,440
um for the young models

569
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
so basically um there is a

570
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,039
young model for the northbound of the

571
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,600
otn slice controller

572
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,960
which we made a shift from

573
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
originally a stand-alone young model

574
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
by

575
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
into a

576
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
an augmented model based on the um

577
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
the model

578
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
defined in the teeth working group

579
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,279
of network slicing and bi yang

580
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,480
and

581
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,320
then we

582
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,840
introduced

583
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,880
the uh

584
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,799
the constructs um that are common for um

585
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,720
transport and network sizing

586
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,799
and then we move along with the

587
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,720
definition of the models um so you could

588
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
see on the right

589
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
uh the model relationship

590
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
for the northbound interface

591
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
being uh network slicing

592
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
yang at the bottom

593
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,960
then we introduced a transphonetic slice

594
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,159
and then next will be the otn slice

595
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,640
which contains otn technology specific

596
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
attributes

597
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
um so on the

598
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,559
mpi basically the southbound of the ogn

599
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,000
slice controller

600
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,880
we

601
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,000
renamed

602
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,440
what was called idf otn slice

603
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
into ietf otn slice mpi

604
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,520
for the obvious reason that we wanted to

605
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,640
preserve the name of ietf4tn slice for

606
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,240
the mpi for the mbi

607
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
next

608
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,120
uh

609
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,279
now or at the end

610
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,039
do you prefer to take questions now or

611
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,480
at the end

612
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,600
um yeah we can we can take questions

613
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,399
okay

614
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,360
so

615
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,919
my question here is he here you use the

616
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,559
the itf transport network slicer because

617
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,279
uh

618
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,240
i guess here you it's it's a common

619
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,480
layer between otn and other transporter

620
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,039
layers like for example optical i guess

621
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,440
or i don't know ethernet or whatever we

622
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
can

623
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,240
okay so um

624
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,159
the transported network

625
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,600
a common layer

626
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
that applies for all uh transport

627
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,799
network technologies including otn uh

628
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,360
optical and uh microwave possibly right

629
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,600
so i mean

630
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,279
i

631
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,000
like it has already been done for the

632
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,240
common types like the layer zero types

633
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
layer one types etc

634
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,760
probably it would make sense to

635
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
extract it from here and have it in a

636
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,240
dedicated document because uh i mean one

637
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
day if we want to

638
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,279
build a specific i don't know

639
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,880
uh wdm slice or a microwave slice

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,360
having uh that the common transporter

641
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
network slicer defined inside the dltn

642
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
document

643
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,760
is is a little bit ambiguous i i would

644
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
say so

645
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,919
uh

646
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,320
i mean this is just my preference i'm

647
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,520
not uh

648
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,320
uh i'm not asking you to do that i'm

649
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,200
asking the the the working group

650
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,279
if uh what's what's his opinion uh here

651
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,320
we

652
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,440
we we can take it to the least uh uh but

653
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
i mean i just wanted to raise uh

654
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,559
to raise this point if that's a common

655
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,240
uh

656
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
module i would uh i would remove it from

657
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,240
the otn slicing document and make it uh

658
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
and make it calmer

659
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760
yeah

660
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,679
sure um chairs that's a good uh

661
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,600
suggestion i i we

662
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,159
we definitely can

663
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,720
discuss that and then basically

664
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
can move it to a common model that

665
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
applies to all

666
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,679
transport technologies

667
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,600
sorry sorry to interrupt you dhruv is

668
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
that a reply to this question to this

669
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
comment

670
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,600
specific to what you just said

671
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
okay

672
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,600
please go ahead

673
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
sorry

674
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,120
yeah i think what is currently happening

675
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,440
is the idea of otn slice that is

676
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
currently not defined

677
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,240
uh

678
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,919
there is a section but that section is

679
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,559
currently empty and what we basically

680
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
have in this document is the itf

681
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
transport network slice so what

682
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
confusion is happening is the document

683
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,960
is called otn but

684
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
the yang model that is currently the

685
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
main focus is the idea of transport

686
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,200
network slice so i've urged the authors

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,279
to think a little bit more and come up

688
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,799
with a good strategy like you know maybe

689
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
we may even have to rename the document

690
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,840
if that comes to it

691
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,279
that's an option yeah we can we can

692
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,799
dedicate this document to the

693
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,600
transporter network slice and have in a

694
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,039
separate one

695
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,320
otn specific augmentation that's that's

696
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,399
fine as well

697
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,240
yeah i see surgery in the cubicle

698
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,640
surgery

699
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
a short answer yes

700
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,880
he's right it's partially right

701
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
in the sense that from nbi uh

702
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
prospective you're right

703
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,600
so there is nothing uh specific for tien

704
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,840
but the document is considering also the

705
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,720
mpi extension for that point

706
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,679
it is specific for otn so

707
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,480
this is why we have not changed nothing

708
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
for the moment but surely

709
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
the

710
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
suggestion from from transport

711
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,960
uh networks lies that can be a different

712
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,919
a separate document uh is is a good

713
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,960
suggestion but the the the point is that

714
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,679
at the moment the the the model is is

715
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,360
dealing with two

716
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
uh different uh

717
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,000
type of uh

718
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,880
model one for an mbi and this is an

719
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,159
extension of the draft in which you so

720
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,519
drew is working and the other one is for

721
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
mpi

722
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
thank you

723
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
okay

724
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,679
the presentation

725
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,080
yeah i agree with sergio and on top of

726
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
that there is also a framework which is

727
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,159
really otn uh

728
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,440
specific

729
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,279
so the it's only the transparent nato

730
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
slice the model which is generic

731
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
so maybe we can figure out how to split

732
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
the two dot the two pieces uh into two

733
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,399
documents

734
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,360
yeah

735
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,640
okay so

736
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,919
thank you

737
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,880
please compliment um what italo has said

738
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
so from the yamato development

739
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,360
perspective we wanted to

740
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,640
have the

741
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
basic framework for

742
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
transport network slice

743
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,360
ready as a generic model and then we

744
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,240
know

745
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,039
what exactly we could put over um the

746
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
otn slice model so basically we do it as

747
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,480
a step-by-step approach

748
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
but as i

749
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
also agree with with the chairs and

750
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
other comments we could consider

751
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,200
separate those two models into two

752
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
drafts

753
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
we could discuss that over the mailing

754
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
list of that call

755
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,719
okay so yeah next slides um so um for

756
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,239
the uh

757
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,000
consideration of using nrp for otn

758
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,119
slicing

759
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,639
so from

760
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,079
from a

761
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,879
constructor point of view the um what we

762
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
see is that nrp

763
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,839
could be

764
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,520
used to

765
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,320
to resolve the scalability issue that

766
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
are mostly

767
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
applied applicable to

768
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,079
pacquiao networks

769
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,040
and

770
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,359
to help reduce the complexity of

771
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,639
realizing slices in the data plane and

772
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,040
control plane so the nrp is a con

773
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,639
internal construct

774
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
but could be

775
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,159
configured by the

776
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
uh

777
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
underlying sdn controller

778
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,440
which

779
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
and the configuration could be pushed uh

780
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,200
through the mpi

781
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,240
to

782
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,880
facilitate the slice realization

783
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,720
um so now for otn um and possibly other

784
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,160
transport networks um the resources um

785
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,960
are like much course granular because of

786
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,680
the

787
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
uh because of the uh time tdm nature of

788
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
the

789
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
uh of the network uh so in this case

790
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,880
uh we could see that uh the use of nrp

791
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
it's still optional

792
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,760
but certainly will have its benefit

793
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
to support

794
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
large-scale networks

795
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,320
and also if we consider that

796
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,119
in the future uh when we see

797
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,400
uh for example otn data plane will start

798
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,680
to evolve

799
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,560
um for example there are proposals about

800
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,160
uh considering to develop a sub one gotn

801
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
um so in that case then the

802
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,960
complexity of supporting

803
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,599
slicing for otn networks will also

804
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,520
become much

805
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
much more complex and then in that case

806
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,320
the use of nrp has certainly

807
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,560
has its benefits so all those texts text

808
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,760
has been

809
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
put into the draft for the consideration

810
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,079
of the audience

811
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,280
um

812
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,599
next

813
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,400
yeah so we put in the draft a diagram

814
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
about uh how we could realize ogn slices

815
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,480
with the nrp uh so from the

816
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,440
uh from the from the uh

817
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,119
diagram you can see

818
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,720
the nrp is used to map

819
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,720
otn slices from external configuration

820
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,920
into a internal topology right and that

821
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,200
each of the nrp topology is

822
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,960
is uh linked to an underlaid

823
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
otnt topology which is received from the

824
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,680
from the otn um

825
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,400
pnc controller or mdsc controller from

826
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
the from the southbound

827
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,359
and um so basically

828
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,280
um the

829
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,000
otn slice controller could choose to use

830
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,800
the

831
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
uh nrp

832
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,960
for resource reservation right and in

833
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,079
that case we we see that um the uh

834
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,640
cardinality between otn slice topology

835
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,000
and nrp topology is uh one to one

836
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
um

837
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,920
so in that case um then we don't need to

838
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,160
to specify

839
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,640
to directly basically make a coloring

840
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,040
configuration on the underlay t topology

841
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,520
but if the nrp topology is not used then

842
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,720
when the user configures multiple

843
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,960
slices and decided to

844
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,280
to map it on to directly onto the

845
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
underlay topology

846
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,640
then

847
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
then we need to

848
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,520
sort of color each of the

849
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,680
resources of the online topology and

850
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,640
send it

851
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
to the otn

852
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,560
um pnc controller

853
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
so that's the two options that we can

854
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,359
see

855
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,520
of using nrp

856
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,200
versus not using our nrp

857
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
next page please

858
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,960
so on the young model ends this is a

859
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
brief glimpse of the

860
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
young model for the transport network

861
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,000
slice

862
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,880
so basically it introduced

863
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,400
a section of network topologies

864
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
in addition to the base model

865
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,880
from from these

866
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,079
so

867
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,119
from a

868
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
northbound perspective a user could

869
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,760
configure a transport network slice by

870
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
specifying topologies

871
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
and then it could also

872
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
designate a an

873
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,480
explicit path based on the topology to

874
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,240
each of the connectivity constructs

875
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,960
okay next page please

876
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
so um there are a couple of open issues

877
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,880
um of

878
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,920
of the modeling so one open issue which

879
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,760
also has been mentioned in the t's

880
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,800
network's license modeling discussion

881
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,119
is how we could

882
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,240
define uh technology-specific attributes

883
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,200
right so

884
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
currently uh the

885
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,160
the design in the teas networks icon is

886
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,960
to

887
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,760
try to use an opaque

888
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
definition of attributes

889
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,520
that can

890
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
and and try to capture technology

891
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
specific um

892
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,760
parameters um and they are in the form

893
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
of key value pairs right so what we see

894
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
is um there might be some issue with

895
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,640
this uh approach is uh in that you know

896
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,119
the most important part is

897
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,599
there is probably need to be

898
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,200
a

899
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,440
implementation implementation agreement

900
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
uh in addition to the yale model to make

901
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
sure

902
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
full interoperability could be achieved

903
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,599
because the the attributes are more

904
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,160
opaque and you don't really know

905
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,599
what is the

906
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
what's the meaning

907
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,720
behind those opaque values right and

908
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,160
some other you know concerns is about

909
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,640
those opaque values cannot be

910
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
explicitly

911
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,960
validated with the young schema

912
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,640
and it may not

913
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
may have an issue capturing complex

914
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
attribute structures

915
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,079
um so

916
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,240
with regards to otn slicing um so

917
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,280
the um our preference is to

918
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,560
go directly with explicit and technology

919
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
specific attributes

920
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,800
and probably we're not going to use the

921
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
opaque definition

922
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,040
of the of the attributes

923
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,800
um so but

924
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,599
that

925
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,880
will continue

926
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,680
working on that and to discuss with the

927
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,960
with the

928
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
network slice young team and try to

929
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,640
figure out the best way to move forward

930
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,640
juve

931
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,319
question event finish your presentation

932
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,119
uh you wanted to

933
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
ask a question or you want me to move

934
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,640
forward

935
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,079
oh okay

936
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,440
because i have multiple questions so

937
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,480
it's better to do it at the end

938
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,000
okay

939
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,760
yeah so okay next page

940
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,640
okay another issue is to

941
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,880
so right now we could see there are

942
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
there could be multiple options for the

943
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,079
mpi uh model uh one

944
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,839
using uh

945
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,960
nrp and the other one of not using nrp

946
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
and in which case we identified um some

947
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,480
gaps in the current topology and we

948
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,359
added

949
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,800
an option for

950
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,359
for coloring the links

951
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,599
in the in the model right so the

952
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,760
question is really

953
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,319
if we define a

954
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
standard draft whether

955
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,560
it is necessary uh to include multiple

956
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,839
optional npi models or we we you know

957
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,160
it's better for um to

958
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,839
go with one

959
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,119
option

960
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,400
so that's

961
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
something you know probably we could

962
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
raise this to the working group

963
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,760
and see what we can do with the with the

964
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,079
model

965
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,440
okay

966
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,040
next page

967
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
okay here are the next steps so we are

968
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,920
to address open issues

969
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,280
and then we continue to work with the

970
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,480
nether slice

971
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
and bi yang

972
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,200
and to align the two models um so and

973
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,720
also

974
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,359
we are going to define um

975
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,760
otn technology specific models based on

976
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,040
the common

977
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,319
transfer net network slice model

978
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,560
which includes adding a technology

979
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,800
specific slo sle for otn and we

980
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,040
are to support both connection based and

981
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,920
resource based slicing

982
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
and also support for multi-technology

983
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,960
links like those links with

984
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,040
which is non-otn

985
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,319
um

986
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,160
yeah and um

987
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,839
the github repo and um we have a weekly

988
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,560
call uh every thursday now um we would

989
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,319
like to uh welcome and more um

990
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,240
participants um

991
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,000
and we like to

992
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,119
um

993
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,880
to receive more comments from the

994
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,079
working group thank you

995
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,040
okay droop and adrian and then

996
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
you i i closed the queue because we are

997
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,480
already 10 minutes late

998
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,599
yeah i'll try to be uh very quick uh

999
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,960
with respect to nrp uh i think we need

1000
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
to also clarify would there be any

1001
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,839
interaction between nrp in the ip layer

1002
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,400
and the nrp here or are they going to be

1003
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,319
completely independent because that was

1004
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,760
not very clear

1005
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,440
from the document

1006
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,839
and the related question from the yang

1007
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,880
modeling since there is a model for nrp

1008
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,440
in teas would there be any interaction

1009
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
between

1010
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,720
that model is that model also supposed

1011
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,119
to be some kind of generic model

1012
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,280
whereas the nrp otn is going to be

1013
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
something specific these things are not

1014
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,359
very clear from nrp point of view so i

1015
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,119
think little bit more

1016
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,160
uh

1017
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,680
thought is needed

1018
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,800
uh

1019
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,640
the second thing which i wanted to talk

1020
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,359
about was the topology part

1021
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,599
since we have added that topology

1022
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,720
in the

1023
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,040
in the model and we had one discussion

1024
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,920
in the tease also that what if a teas

1025
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,960
model

1026
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,160
used the vn type 2 mechanism where we

1027
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,640
put a reference to an abstract

1028
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
topology same as what we do in vn type

1029
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,800
2. would that meet your requirement or

1030
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,960
you still need a topology

1031
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,000
separate from that in the t so uh like

1032
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,040
think about that and like you know

1033
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,119
discuss with the tease authors and let's

1034
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,920
come up with a good solution here

1035
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
thank you okay let me make a quick

1036
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
comments yes um so i agree with you um

1037
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,359
one of the uh main uh driven factor for

1038
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,280
for defining a common model for

1039
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
transport is we don't have an option to

1040
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,280
specify topology in the base model um so

1041
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
yeah but

1042
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,520
short answer is it depends and then we

1043
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,000
we could discuss that offline to figure

1044
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,680
out the best way to

1045
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,680
have the support for topologies

1046
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,760
hi it's adrian

1047
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,839
i wanted to just take the time to say

1048
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,119
thank you for doing the work to

1049
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,300
integrate with the

1050
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,760
[Music]

1051
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,040
the tease

1052
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,839
slicing service model since i asked for

1053
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,839
that the document's much cleaner as a

1054
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,760
result

1055
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,839
and then since the the discussions moved

1056
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,280
in that direction

1057
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,680
um we do need to step back and try to

1058
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,200
understand

1059
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,720
whether a slice is supposed to expose

1060
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,160
anything about the underlying topology

1061
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,040
in that concept of a slice service

1062
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,520
and it may be that the type of work that

1063
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,760
we want to do here

1064
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,319
exposes topology and therefore we should

1065
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,560
stop talking about slices and continue

1066
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,599
to talk about virtual network topologies

1067
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,680
and if we want to integrate ourselves

1068
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,720
with slicing we have to understand

1069
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,680
that the slicing service a bit like a

1070
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,280
vpn service

1071
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,319
is

1072
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,160
has an opaque view of the of the

1073
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,640
underlay

1074
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,319
thank you thanks a lot

1075
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,759
next one is omiano

1076
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
can you hear me

1077
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,520
yes

1078
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,200
okay uh thank you and good day everybody

1079
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,280
this is hamir from huawei and i'm

1080
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,640
presenting this

1081
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,280
level 1 connectivity service model

1082
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,960
on behalf of all the authors and

1083
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,800
contributors

1084
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,960
next page please

1085
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,119
yeah so this one is a brief update on

1086
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,640
the status and

1087
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,119
it has been a while since our last

1088
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,559
presentation it was in itf 109 for

1089
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,400
version 13

1090
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,000
and after that we have actually a few

1091
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,640
updates over there but i think the major

1092
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,440
one would be uh to address the comments

1093
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,480
in the young doctor alaska review

1094
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,880
uh we provided more this detailed

1095
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,640
description uh in some of the lyft notes

1096
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,319
and we moved the json example to the

1097
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,720
appendix so basically it tried

1098
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,119
it was trying to to clarify

1099
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,480
uh those

1100
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
descriptions in the models that may

1101
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,359
cause some confusions

1102
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
and we are having one github repository

1103
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,319
uh available uh on this early one csm

1104
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,960
and we check it out because it's very

1105
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,960
close to the working group last call and

1106
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,920
we figure out there are two issues to be

1107
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,359
discussed

1108
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,160
so that would be the next two pages

1109
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,240
next please

1110
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,960
and the first open issue is

1111
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,760
uh

1112
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,040
actually a hello high level one

1113
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
the question is about okay how to

1114
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
coordinate the performance monitoring

1115
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,680
stuff regarding the layer one

1116
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,480
connectivity in this document and the

1117
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
other document

1118
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,119
so

1119
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,200
our current scope is we are coordinating

1120
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,480
with the performance monitor

1121
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,599
metrics specified in math 63

1122
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,640
and it would be useful if we could also

1123
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,400
reconcile with

1124
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,640
itu-t document like g.a.26

1125
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,359
but we also

1126
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,680
have received some comments say whether

1127
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,720
it is useful to coordinate with other pm

1128
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,160
models like the one in our working group

1129
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,480
as individual draft client signal

1130
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,800
performance monitoring and some other

1131
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,760
like the vpn pm ippm and whatever so

1132
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,880
yeah uh well but but that part of the

1133
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,119
work is just starting so we are

1134
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,000
providing a few options that can be

1135
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,040
considered as resolutions and the first

1136
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,520
option would be okay how about if we

1137
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,640
remove the the pm related part and then

1138
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,960
proceeded and leave this work to other

1139
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,760
tpm models and this one is

1140
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,640
the authors uh having some kind of

1141
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
preference to this option

1142
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
and

1143
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,359
the second option would be leave it with

1144
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,480
only math 63 alignment and the option

1145
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,599
three is

1146
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,040
okay we should redo the pm part

1147
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,759
i see john

1148
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,720
try the mac

1149
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,520
uh now the next page please

1150
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,760
okay and the next issue is about the

1151
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,480
descriptions in the young itself and the

1152
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,680
problem was according to math 63 the

1153
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,839
configuration of the protocol

1154
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,319
coding function and the interface

1155
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,720
functions attributes

1156
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,559
should be consistent and there are some

1157
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,559
kind of constraint

1158
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:53,440
when

1159
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,720
given the definite when people give the

1160
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,160
definitions of such kind of parameters

1161
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,000
we were trying to describe in the young

1162
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
grammar but after uh checking with the

1163
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,440
young experts in that mode we find okay

1164
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,280
this is not

1165
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,040
accomplished

1166
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
achievable and we finally decided to to

1167
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,720
tweak

1168
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,960
only the uh

1169
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
descriptions in the module

1170
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,640
so we will do

1171
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,040
a review another iteration of global

1172
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
review and update to the description by

1173
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,599
adding the constraints

1174
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,480
okay next please

1175
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,599
okay then we okay i think we are listed

1176
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,640
to discuss about the three options for

1177
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
issue one and if we can reach our

1178
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,680
agreement we can do an update and

1179
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,359
request working group last call and

1180
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,800
that's all for the

1181
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,200
draft presentation

1182
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,520
thank you

1183
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,880
so i would

1184
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,800
i would suggest to

1185
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,760
i mean since we are pretty close to the

1186
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,839
the last call of this document

1187
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,720
i would bring the two open issues to the

1188
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,119
to the main list to see

1189
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,960
what's the opinion of the working group

1190
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,000
and then

1191
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
i think we're done

1192
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,720
there is some problem

1193
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,280
i i

1194
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,839
i can't see the video any longer i i

1195
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,480
didn't know if it was my problem or it's

1196
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,920
in the room looks a problem in the

1197
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,839
meeting room

1198
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,079
look at the chat

1199
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,760
okay

1200
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,520
network issues

1201
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,839
okay

1202
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,240
but the others can can still hear

1203
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,680
it looks like the remote

1204
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,559
offline part is good yes

1205
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,240
okay it's the on-site people who are

1206
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,440
let's move on then

1207
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,240
since

1208
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,880
we are already pretty

1209
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,480
pretty late

1210
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,160
so we have slot 4

1211
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,280
presented by sergio

1212
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,240
okay

1213
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,599
good morning good afternoon good evening

1214
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,960
depending on

1215
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,400
location

1216
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,640
so i'm sergio bellotti i'm going to

1217
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,520
present the update of the optical

1218
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,240
impairment topology model

1219
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,200
on behalf of cultures and contributors

1220
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,399
next slide

1221
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,800
okay so

1222
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,319
as we

1223
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,280
have a weekly call the major activities

1224
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,880
since its

1225
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,359
routine

1226
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,960
we have

1227
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,079
the

1228
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,559
usual weekly call

1229
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,000
on tuesday from 2 30 pm

1230
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,240
everybody is welcome to attend and so

1231
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,960
the the the meeting is open and welcome

1232
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,240
to us

1233
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,399
other uh other people

1234
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,240
we updated both the text and the young

1235
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,640
model

1236
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,000
the the first update has been done

1237
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,119
uh related to uh

1238
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,040
an issue that is

1239
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,160
there from from a while

1240
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,200
is

1241
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,160
not trivial so i mean

1242
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,920
we started to have a general requirement

1243
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,119
regarding the otsi terminology alignment

1244
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,960
with g807

1245
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,359
we have not completed that in the sense

1246
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,160
that uh surely before

1247
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,040
uh to have a stable version

1248
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,160
uh and to be ready uh for for last

1249
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,680
school and uh

1250
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,280
and the young daughter review we need to

1251
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,160
have

1252
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,640
a complete review on that

1253
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,319
but we started to do that

1254
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,240
we

1255
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,160
we added

1256
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,839
a section

1257
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,880
at the 2.2.3

1258
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,079
section

1259
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,359
uh to

1260
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,960
clarify

1261
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,599
the relationship so

1262
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,839
first to clarify why we need to have ots

1263
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,839
ig information

1264
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,319
in the context of the topology model

1265
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,839
and

1266
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:28,720
what

1267
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,440
we

1268
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,640
we agree is that the

1269
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,880
the presence of the utsi

1270
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,000
is important in the view of the

1271
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,440
otsi global unique identification

1272
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,400
so

1273
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,400
in the model our approach is to have a

1274
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,880
hierarchical approach in which we have a

1275
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,359
no tsi group id

1276
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,480
that

1277
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,520
is identified uniquely the ots ig in the

1278
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,000
network and then

1279
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,799
they

1280
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,799
contain otsi

1281
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,880
identifier

1282
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,079
that is providing the the the local uh

1283
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,000
scope of

1284
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,480
in the context of this

1285
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,460
side group

1286
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,960
[Music]

1287
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,760
there is a lot of noise i don't know if

1288
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,200
for everybody is the same

1289
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,000
well

1290
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,359
okay

1291
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,040
uh

1292
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,119
then we we added a a section regarding a

1293
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,559
unidirectional trial

1294
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,720
so the the point is that

1295
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
the

1296
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,880
the in the case of unidirectional

1297
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,880
transponder a unidirectional 3r

1298
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,040
the transceiver of each optical

1299
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,559
transponder

1300
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,960
receive the signal from one cent and

1301
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,760
transmit the regenerator optical signal

1302
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,079
in the other urgent adherence segment so

1303
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,079
in the case of

1304
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,319
carrier for the carrier frequency

1305
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,520
we can operate a different frequency

1306
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,160
optical frequency between the receiver

1307
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
and the transmitter

1308
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,760
but uh

1309
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,760
in the model we have defined the

1310
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,160
transceiver capabilities that is the

1311
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,359
transceiver mode and this is a property

1312
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,480
of

1313
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,079
the transceiver it is applied at the at

1314
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,559
the same time to the transmitter and the

1315
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,000
receiver

1316
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,799
so the transceiver mode has to be the

1317
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,079
same in the two segment of the two side

1318
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,119
of

1319
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,839
three hour generator so for this reason

1320
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,319
the transceiver mode

1321
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,160
can be cannot be changed in the context

1322
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,960
of

1323
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,280
um

1324
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,160
of uni-directional 3r

1325
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,880
we added specific tests for that

1326
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,359
and then we started to have a new

1327
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,599
section regarding the protection

1328
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,200
architecture

1329
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,359
for the young model we we fix two issue

1330
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,359
uh that is basically uh regarding the uh

1331
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,799
tilt target

1332
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,920
uh to to clarify the the context of the

1333
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,160
tilt turret it is related to the upper

1334
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,720
and lower frequency

1335
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,599
of

1336
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,000
amplifier

1337
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,640
we introduced modification

1338
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,960
regarding the protection modeling this

1339
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,280
is a work on going

1340
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
but we started on that and we started to

1341
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,040
to make a modification

1342
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,079
and

1343
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,559
we have other issue that is impacting

1344
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,920
the young

1345
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,839
but

1346
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,440
the the

1347
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,599
these are fixing in the context of itf

1348
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,640
layer 0 type

1349
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,079
but is still related to the to the

1350
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,520
optical impairment

1351
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,839
next slide

1352
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,960
okay uh so

1353
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,040
we we said that we started to work on

1354
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,880
the optical protection

1355
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,720
uh so in case of the optical protection

1356
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,160
uh as depicted in the in the up

1357
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,440
part of the drone uh

1358
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,160
they

1359
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
at the splitter

1360
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,040
the signal

1361
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,880
uh is a is a dupli optical duplicated

1362
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,680
before entering to the airdrop part of

1363
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,040
the rodent

1364
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,280
and at the selector

1365
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,839
one of the two signal from the drop

1366
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,559
ports of the rodent is selected there is

1367
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,200
no problem in that there you have end to

1368
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,880
end otsi

1369
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,160
a single one

1370
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,240
in case uh but the problem is uh uh

1371
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,440
is is uh is uh uh in the conte in the

1372
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,240
case in which you have one of the length

1373
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,920
that is uh with the triar regenerator

1374
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,480
because in this case the part the

1375
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,559
end-to-end part

1376
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,799
or tsi is blacked is broken and

1377
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,040
we have no more end-to-end

1378
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
rtsi

1379
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,839
next slide

1380
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,040
so

1381
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,240
they they

1382
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,119
what we need to have in the topology

1383
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,680
model so in the topology module the path

1384
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,000
computation need to know the existing

1385
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,839
otsi

1386
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,839
in each omx section

1387
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,799
for the reason to determine

1388
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,520
what are the optical impairments of the

1389
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,480
existing otsi on the

1390
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,799
calculation of the optical flexibility

1391
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,640
of the newer tsi

1392
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,599
and

1393
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,000
the opposite so the impact of the new

1394
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,839
rtsi with respect to the existing one

1395
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,160
so

1396
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,200
in the case of protection uh the the

1397
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,480
question that the the the autos put on

1398
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,880
the demo is how to represent the

1399
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,640
existing ltsi

1400
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,040
already there in the network

1401
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,880
uh so

1402
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
we uh

1403
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,480
there is a

1404
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,599
we have two optical seniors at the up

1405
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,480
are the at the input the selector

1406
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,440
that

1407
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,839
may have optical impairments impact

1408
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:24,799
because

1409
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,760
is is linked to the different parts

1410
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,640
and

1411
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,839
in case

1412
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,480
and the optical feasibility has to check

1413
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,480
anyway in the two parts

1414
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,160
because we need to be independent of

1415
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,799
uh the action related to the switching

1416
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,400
for the protection

1417
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,280
so

1418
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,640
uh

1419
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,920
our solution next slide

1420
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,000
uh for the for the representation of the

1421
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,160
otsi is to have only one otsi but

1422
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,440
with the

1423
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,200
representing all the associated parts

1424
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,799
related to the otsi so in this case that

1425
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,520
is related to the same picture of slide

1426
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
3

1427
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,799
we have

1428
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,559
one otsi

1429
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,359
but we have an impact on the optical

1430
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,920
impeller with different three parts

1431
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,160
related to the same otsi

1432
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,319
so in the model from young perspective

1433
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,599
we associated to the otsi with a list of

1434
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,720
parts

1435
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,839
that we may we name n and c part

1436
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,520
there is a basic physical assumption

1437
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,280
that at the ingress of or and aggress of

1438
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,520
a splitter and selector dots identify is

1439
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,720
the same

1440
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,520
and the nmc

1441
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,720
are

1442
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,599
can

1443
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,319
are different the nmc parts are

1444
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,799
different

1445
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,799
in the same

1446
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,720
same way the in that the oms section

1447
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,680
will

1448
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,160
we will have the reference to all the

1449
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,440
utsi

1450
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,039
and the reference to the related parts

1451
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,680
for each other

1452
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,839
next

1453
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,960
this is a the modification of the young

1454
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,839
the

1455
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,720
on the right on the on the left we have

1456
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,079
the the

1457
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,200
definition of the ots ig and the related

1458
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,559
otsi

1459
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,240
and for each otsi we added the the a

1460
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,440
list of a related nmc part identifier

1461
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,160
at the same time in the context of the

1462
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,160
oms section

1463
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,839
uh we have uh

1464
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,799
the the the the media channel group the

1465
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,119
ltsi g

1466
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,559
that is related to the specific media

1467
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,599
channel

1468
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,480
and

1469
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,200
the

1470
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,880
list of the

1471
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,960
otsi related with the specific

1472
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,160
related nmc part

1473
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,280
to specific to that

1474
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,160
to the ltsi

1475
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,680
next

1476
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,200
so what are the open issue that we are

1477
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,400
needed to work on the first one is that

1478
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,240
we need to complete the optical

1479
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,440
protection

1480
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,319
switch

1481
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,480
that is a work on going

1482
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,119
um

1483
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,799
then there is

1484
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,079
the

1485
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,280
the model

1486
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,359
the the

1487
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,799
there is a

1488
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,720
a an issue related to

1489
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,200
supported

1490
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,319
remote optical transponder

1491
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,400
the model is already

1492
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,480
able to support

1493
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,039
the remote optical transponder connected

1494
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,839
to the wdm node but we need to explain

1495
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,240
in a specific text

1496
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,599
how the model is is supporting the

1497
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,799
different scenarios

1498
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,280
there is an issue that is related to the

1499
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,720
expert in in life ref we open we

1500
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,640
discussed with the expert like robertson

1501
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,039
about the net mode

1502
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,760
in the network

1503
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,880
because

1504
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,839
we

1505
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,119
have in mind that to uh sudden to use

1506
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,119
unchester function but

1507
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,960
there is still debate

1508
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,079
on the

1509
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,200
topic

1510
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,119
and for example in the context of the

1511
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,880
flex grid

1512
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,440
we practically decide to come back to

1513
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,720
the relative path part

1514
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,599
there is a

1515
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,559
a need that for a review technology

1516
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,599
that has been addressed partially

1517
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:00,720
and that

1518
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,640
there is a a an issue

1519
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,880
related to the boundary between layers

1520
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,760
the only one because the the model

1521
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,280
there are some

1522
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,839
functionality like effect inverse

1523
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,280
multiplexing

1524
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,079
that is a layer one functionality but is

1525
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,880
in the scope because he is a related to

1526
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
the transponder so he's in the scope of

1527
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,119
this document and we need to clarify in

1528
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,440
the text that

1529
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,240
then there is a

1530
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,000
a specific uh issue that is related to

1531
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,559
the process improvement

1532
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,760
and

1533
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,720
a new one that is related to the usage

1534
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,359
of container is not a big issue it's

1535
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:46,799
just a need to review when the usable

1536
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,960
container as in

1537
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,599
immediate parent of a list

1538
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,760
is really needed in the model or not

1539
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,440
we have our github and every

1540
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,000
there is the minutes there there is all

1541
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,760
the issue that is

1542
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,480
described so everything that is

1543
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,039
summarized here you can find that in the

1544
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,039
github

1545
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,200
uh next next step

1546
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,839
okay we need to complete the otsim

1547
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,079
protection model we address the

1548
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,480
representation of the

1549
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,839
otsi

1550
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:24,640
but

1551
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,440
we need to adding the report optical

1552
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,480
protection capability including oms

1553
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,480
protection

1554
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,000
we need to address the rest of the list

1555
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,480
the the issue that at the moment are

1556
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,200
eight if i remember well

1557
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,240
uh

1558
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,839
analyze possible enhancement uh

1559
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,240
apart protection that

1560
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,359
we should cover as future

1561
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,920
and the intention would be to have a

1562
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,720
stable version by a next

1563
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,839
itf 115 and then be ready for a

1564
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,880
young doctor review

1565
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,880
that's all from my side

1566
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,200
thank you

1567
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,559
questions

1568
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,080
welcome

1569
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,679
i'll prepare

1570
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,319
the next slides

1571
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,439
i don't see any questions so sergey you

1572
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,198
probably can start with the

1573
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,238
1993 base

1574
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,238
okay

1575
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,600
they um

1576
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,479
we have a first presentation last time

1577
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,238
about the rfc 1993 bs

1578
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,779
and that these slides

1579
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:49,920
[Music]

1580
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,080
represent the fact that we changed the

1581
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,359
quotas because we encompass

1582
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,238
the cover part of

1583
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,479
both the documents so

1584
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,759
the original rfc 1993

1585
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,238
and the layer zero type extension draft

1586
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,479
so this is why there is a long list of

1587
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,319
quotas

1588
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,759
uh next

1589
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,040
slide so a short background

1590
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,120
so we we um

1591
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,040
we we have obsolete um

1592
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,040
this document the intention is to

1593
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,359
obsolete 1993 encompassing the content

1594
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,640
of the rfc with the layer 0 type

1595
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,520
extension drafts

1596
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,439
there is a specific github

1597
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,479
and

1598
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,920
basically the work has been started

1599
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,799
when in the view to

1600
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:49,759
match

1601
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,640
the comment received at the itf on under

1602
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,158
12.

1603
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:55,120
we are

1604
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,000
we have restructured the document draft

1605
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,679
itf layer zero type extension to become

1606
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,560
rfc 1993

1607
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,840
now for itf 14

1608
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,400
we fixing the uh

1609
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,239
the issue 48

1610
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,520
so

1611
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,239
the

1612
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,280
content of the layer zero type extension

1613
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,280
have been moved into the layer zero type

1614
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,239
uh younger so we have only one module

1615
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,960
the encompassing uh all

1616
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,679
and we okay we delete it in the

1617
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,380
repository the uh

1618
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,800
[Music]

1619
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,920
the itf layer zero type extension yang

1620
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,800
we fixing a lot of uh issue

1621
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,840
for uh

1622
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,440
these itf

1623
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,800
um

1624
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,679
partially there are three issues that i

1625
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,679
said before in the presentation for

1626
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,400
optical impairment that

1627
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,440
is directly related to the optical

1628
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,159
impairment topology model

1629
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,199
next thank you

1630
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,360
okay this is a

1631
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,480
first issue that we

1632
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,199
we fixed we added

1633
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,360
a new modulation format and the

1634
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,960
description

1635
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,920
uh

1636
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,760
that we realized

1637
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,480
was missing in the model

1638
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,480
next

1639
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,880
uh here practically the 4233 is related

1640
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,040
to uh to fix a wrong reference

1641
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,400
um

1642
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,440
from

1643
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,400
the

1644
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,480
the the for the left

1645
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,520
uh we need that to we have modified the

1646
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,679
reference in the definition of the

1647
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,440
operational mode

1648
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,560
uh

1649
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,239
there is a wrong

1650
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,760
reference for the iqt instead we uh

1651
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,800
added

1652
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,120
in yellows in the in the

1653
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,560
slides uh a specific the specific

1654
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,440
reference of the section in the optical

1655
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,480
impairment draft in which we describe

1656
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,760
what does it mean operational uh

1657
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,960
mode

1658
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,080
on the right part uh there is a wrong

1659
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,480
reference with respect rfc

1660
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,280
6205 in the frequency definition and we

1661
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,040
delete that

1662
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,360
next

1663
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,199
okay here uh

1664
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,000
the the the the we

1665
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,960
have

1666
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,080
fixed

1667
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,960
uh

1668
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,400
three uh related one to the other uh

1669
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,880
issue that is related to the penalty

1670
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,199
definition and the associated

1671
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,040
accumulated value

1672
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,840
uh the originally the model uh

1673
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,560
presenting

1674
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,480
the

1675
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,679
the combination of chromatin dispersion

1676
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,920
and polarization moist

1677
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,760
this person with associated penalty

1678
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,960
so

1679
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,199
is a was a triplet

1680
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,320
a

1681
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,400
list of triplet

1682
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,679
now we have a separate

1683
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,880
list of pair accumulated effect

1684
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,239
and associated penalty

1685
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,400
and we also modified the penalty

1686
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,320
description and we modified that align

1687
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,840
with also

1688
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,880
the

1689
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,000
strictly aligned with what open config

1690
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
is

1691
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,560
providing

1692
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,440
next

1693
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,120
so this is the modification related to

1694
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,199
the

1695
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,040
pair of

1696
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,159
effect plus penalty so

1697
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,000
we have now the

1698
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,960
list of chromatic dispersion penalty

1699
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,840
polarization dispersion penalty we have

1700
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,600
already

1701
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,360
the pdl

1702
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,800
related

1703
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,080
penalty

1704
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,760
already

1705
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,800
made with the effect plus associated

1706
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,280
penalty that was in the original

1707
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,120
document

1708
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,400
next thank you

1709
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,840
uh we clarified the meaning of an

1710
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
attribute that uh

1711
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,040
it was uh

1712
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,400
original provide a lot of discussion uh

1713
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,760
in the group

1714
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,640
so we we had a the central frequency

1715
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,600
step but was

1716
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,760
there was some misunderstanding on the

1717
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,800
meaning

1718
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,000
and uh

1719
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,480
we clarified that the attribute is

1720
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,040
dealing with the granularity of the

1721
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,360
transmitter turnability

1722
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,000
of the carrier center frequency

1723
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,120
and

1724
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,080
so

1725
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,880
we have updated both the name of the

1726
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,320
attribute

1727
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,199
with the transceiver tunability and the

1728
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,480
description

1729
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,440
of

1730
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,239
the

1731
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,320
attributes

1732
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,639
next

1733
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,199
we clarify the

1734
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,759
intention

1735
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,560
this comment from jana

1736
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,760
and

1737
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,120
that is correct the comment so

1738
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
we need to uh

1739
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,400
revise

1740
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,600
the section of the january as suggested

1741
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,920
next

1742
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,880
so next step we still need to reconcile

1743
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,840
the test in the introduction from rfc

1744
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,920
1993 with the one from layer 0 type

1745
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,360
extension

1746
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,000
and we need to complete the

1747
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,679
appendix

1748
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,840
a in which we

1749
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,040
listed that we should list the changes

1750
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,560
from lsc 1993

1751
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,840
and

1752
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,800
we need to fix the remaining issue

1753
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,719
that is

1754
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,280
provided in the our github

1755
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,040
uh that's all for my side

1756
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,400
thank you

1757
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,400
questions

1758
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,000
we

1759
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
know

1760
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,480
young data model for network hardware

1761
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,199
inventory

1762
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,280
you hear me you hear me yes perfectly

1763
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,760
okay thank you okay hello everyone i'm

1764
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,560
chapter from hawaii i'm glad to do this

1765
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,640
presentation on behalf of all the

1766
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,159
contributors

1767
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,880
our job is dealing with network hardware

1768
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,360
inventory management and provides

1769
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,159
a

1770
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,239
young data model which can be used in

1771
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,800
the northbound of network controller

1772
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,520
that's like this

1773
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,679
after last presentation in camp

1774
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,600
we have triggered some discussion on the

1775
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,159
main list to find a suitable working

1776
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,040
group to continue our job

1777
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,600
but no feedback is received

1778
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,920
so we continue to specify our jobs in

1779
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,400
camp and keep some other

1780
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,480
working group informed

1781
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,920
these are the updates to our job

1782
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,640
since last itm meeting

1783
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,600
for the first part of the of our work uh

1784
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,480
we have apps uh we added

1785
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,560
uh more attributes to the young data

1786
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,679
model based on the model defined in rfc

1787
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,280
8348

1788
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,400
and some integration experience

1789
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,400
at first we have identified some common

1790
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,120
attributes such as uid

1791
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,159
name

1792
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,199
areas description and location

1793
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,760
which can apply to all the unwanted

1794
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,800
objects

1795
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,719
and secondly

1796
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:27,520
uh

1797
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,080
for the component object of narrow

1798
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,400
element we have reused most of the

1799
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,000
attributes from fc 8348 with some

1800
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,080
refinement that will be introduced in

1801
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,760
detail in the next several slides

1802
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,360
please notice that

1803
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,239
these refinements are limited in the

1804
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,960
scope to our draft we don't plan to

1805
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,159
update

1806
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,159
abc8348

1807
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,239
and third for the right object besides

1808
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,320
the common attribute we have also

1809
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,440
defined some specific attributes

1810
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
such as height

1811
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,280
wise and depth

1812
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,520
and for never element

1813
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,159
we all agree that most of the attributes

1814
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,679
in absolute 834a defined for components

1815
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,719
are also applicable for network

1816
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,199
the second part of our work

1817
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,840
is we continue the discussion of

1818
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,239
scalability issues

1819
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,560
raised in last version the conclusion

1820
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,320
will be also introduced in the following

1821
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,679
slide

1822
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,360
okay let's go with the refinement

1823
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,120
introduced at first next page please

1824
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,440
in the

1825
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,120
data model of fc8348

1826
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,719
a component

1827
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,159
parallel reference attribute is defined

1828
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:51,840
with this model uh if the refcom client

1829
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,000
want to find the uh find these

1830
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,880
components grand prime or higher

1831
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,960
hierarchical level component

1832
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,800
you need to do the retrieval step by

1833
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,239
step

1834
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,719
which is time consuming

1835
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,760
so we suggest to provide a full release

1836
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,199
of hierarchical parent identifiers to to

1837
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:15,040
reduce this repeated work

1838
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,560
this model

1839
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,400
could also support more philosophical

1840
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,040
retrieval function for example the kind

1841
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,280
can get one or more

1842
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,080
uh

1843
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,719
component level to find his contained

1844
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,520
trial components

1845
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,040
okay let's start

1846
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,840
let's take please

1847
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,080
after we will the uh attributes defined

1848
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,840
in fc 8348 and we collected some

1849
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,560
requirements from operators we think

1850
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,199
that there are some components with the

1851
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,239
attribute missing in

1852
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:56,159
rc8348 so we have designed a choice case

1853
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:59,199
structure as a placeholder

1854
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,800
for defining these extensions

1855
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,679
the cases are distinguished by their

1856
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,760
cast so that different component

1857
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,840
specific attribute could be defined in a

1858
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,199
separate

1859
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,719
container

1860
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,840
the details in each of these specific

1861
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,239
info containers are still under

1862
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,920
discussion

1863
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,880
next page please

1864
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,400
this is a minor change

1865
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,560
in rc 8348

1866
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,159
uh the preferred value for model name of

1867
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,880
the component is his prime number

1868
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,840
according to the young description

1869
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,360
actually

1870
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,480
the part number is more recognized term

1871
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,040
than model name so we have renamed the

1872
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,320
attribute to part number directory

1873
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,199
network please

1874
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,800
here's a here is an open discussion

1875
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,440
about the design of location

1876
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,840
in fc 8348

1877
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,520
there were two attributes named by

1878
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,000
physical index in parent

1879
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,920
relative position

1880
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,679
which can be used as location info

1881
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,840
but if the kind want to have a

1882
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,360
components

1883
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,040
absolute

1884
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,320
location

1885
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,199
the client needs to retrieve its parent

1886
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,760
component one by one

1887
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,480
we're currently evaluating two different

1888
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,920
design approach to solve these problems

1889
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,480
uh the first option provide a

1890
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,400
hierarchical structure just like the

1891
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,920
parent identifier identify list these

1892
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,080
in previous slides

1893
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,600
this line

1894
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,040
this design

1895
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:43,920
can

1896
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,239
support similar flexible retrieval like

1897
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,000
i mentioned previously

1898
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,679
but this structure is less flexible and

1899
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,400
risk risks to be

1900
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,800
applicable to optical network animal

1901
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,960
only

1902
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,000
the second option is to define

1903
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,880
the location as a string attribute

1904
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,159
for optical narrow animals a string

1905
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,199
pattern can be defined to contain

1906
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,440
similar position information like option

1907
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,400
1

1908
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,520
but

1909
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,800
because because it is a string format a

1910
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,880
different pattern can be used in other

1911
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,159
scenario

1912
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,320
so the same

1913
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,639
so we consider this option is more

1914
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,080
flexible

1915
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,400
but the same concern is we are not sure

1916
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,719
whether this string pattern is

1917
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,639
applicable only to optical network

1918
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,840
enemies

1919
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
or not

1920
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,440
but we have noticed

1921
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,239
that

1922
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,000
in open config

1923
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,159
open complete also use a string pattern

1924
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:48,280
to provide location info

1925
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,599
okay let's fly please

1926
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,560
and for the discussion of a scalability

1927
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,800
issue we have checked all the discussion

1928
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,520
programs in github if you are interested

1929
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,000
in the discussion progress you can you

1930
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,199
can have a look at the issue issue 32 in

1931
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,480
github

1932
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,719
here we just want to introduce our

1933
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,960
conclusion due to a time limitation

1934
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,080
we think that the scalability issues uh

1935
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:21,199
will surely happen in big networks

1936
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,600
uh regardless what kind of young data

1937
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,920
model is adopted

1938
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,520
and

1939
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,520
this issue can also be found in other

1940
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,159
data models integration such as 4g and

1941
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,800
servers or tunnel etc

1942
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,120
the root cause of the scalability issue

1943
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,199
comes from the limited

1944
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:43,679
transfer capability of http particles

1945
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,600
maybe some other

1946
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,040
export

1947
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,480
mechanism can help to solve this problem

1948
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,040
but it is truly out of school

1949
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,120
for our job

1950
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,360
the full synchronization scenario

1951
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,560
usually happen on day one

1952
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,960
at day one of the first integration

1953
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,320
the api used mostly in

1954
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,199
in

1955
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,600
in daily maintenance are never ending

1956
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,480
based

1957
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,800
and there were limited data in one level

1958
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,600
animal so the scalability issue may be

1959
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,000
less impacting as originally

1960
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,480
we have also

1961
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,520
considered an alternative model uh which

1962
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,400
define inventory object uh directly

1963
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,679
instead of a

1964
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,480
gillette generic component

1965
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,600
so it is

1966
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,800
it's much easier to understand but

1967
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,360
it it would be less flexible to support

1968
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,159
new in one to have hardware type

1969
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,880
than defining a general model object as

1970
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,480
done in in current model

1971
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,960
so we plan to continue our work with the

1972
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,040
current with our current model

1973
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,559
okay let's pay please

1974
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,520
as a summary we have introduced a

1975
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,520
attribute discussion and scalability

1976
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,520
issue discussion today

1977
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,520
and for the next step

1978
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,239
since we have decided to continue

1979
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,880
to move forward with the current model

1980
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,080
and enrich a lot of attributes on it

1981
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,880
we think that our draft is now ready for

1982
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,520
second working group adoption

1983
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,199
uh we also

1984
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,199
uh we are also looking forward to get

1985
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,520
some input from other technologies such

1986
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,679
as ip and microwave

1987
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,360
to cover more application scenario

1988
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,960
and we also plan to cause some more open

1989
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,239
issues before next itf meeting

1990
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,840
if you are interested in

1991
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,880
interested in our job we want to welcome

1992
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,080
you to join our discussion and we have a

1993
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,440
weekly meeting every wednesday and if uh

1994
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,760
and you can find more info uh mission

1995
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,159
from github thank you

1996
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,920
okay that's that's all for my

1997
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,480
presentation uh presentation today

1998
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,120
thank you again

1999
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,239
thank you thanks a lot

2000
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:13,440
uh so yes just just to recap

2001
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,639
i mean uh

2002
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,880
when when this light this

2003
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,920
draft was first presented that we

2004
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,320
thought that it was a good idea

2005
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,719
to discuss with the net mode

2006
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,560
if

2007
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,840
what was the right place for it

2008
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,880
and

2009
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,239
i mean uh

2010
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,880
in the end we decided to continue

2011
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,040
this work in c camp

2012
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,199
um

2013
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,239
does

2014
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,880
does anyone believe that this is not the

2015
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,400
belonging to to see camp maybe the

2016
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,960
question is uh

2017
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,560
mostly to john

2018
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,600
do you think well of course any progress

2019
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,800
will be

2020
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,480
discussed and aligned with the with

2021
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,520
network we will have a sort of uh

2022
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,280
frequent uh

2023
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,800
liaison

2024
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,960
relationship with them about the draft

2025
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,920
but

2026
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,639
i mean if uh

2027
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,080
if there is interest in the working

2028
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,920
group to to progress the work in c camp

2029
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,000
uh i'm i'm pretty fine with that

2030
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,560
okay thank you

2031
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,880
since you asked me i'll come to the mic

2032
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,639
and answer but my only answer right now

2033
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,159
is i don't have an intelligent answer

2034
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:32,239
for you i'm sorry

2035
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,239
reserve response

2036
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,840
okay

2037
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,239
thanks we can we can discuss this

2038
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,920
offline but i mean

2039
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,800
thanks thanks a lot to the others for uh

2040
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,760
uh

2041
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,440
for the progresses and to to explain

2042
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,040
uh

2043
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,120
the issues and the uh homing of

2044
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,639
the draft

2045
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,280
thank you next one

2046
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,000
we have now we tallow if i'm not

2047
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,719
mistaken

2048
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,960
yep

2049
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,800
thanks okay thank you mr chairman i'm

2050
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,440
italo from huawei um i'm presenting a

2051
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,719
new draft

2052
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,440
on otm computation next slide please on

2053
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,159
behalf of quarters and contributors

2054
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,159
okay the initial proposal for otimpa

2055
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,199
computation rav was presented uh into in

2056
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,040
itf 112

2057
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,520
and together with w zone flexigrid and

2058
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,320
the feedback in the itf 2013 discussion

2059
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,840
was to split

2060
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,320
the otm part on a different rafter so

2061
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,000
now we moved

2062
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,080
the otm computation into this new

2063
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,320
drafter the work is quite

2064
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,400
straightforward we are augmenting the

2065
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,040
path computational rpc defined by teaser

2066
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,440
witho technology specific attributes

2067
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,920
defined in layer one types and we are

2068
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,560
keeping these augmentations in alignment

2069
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,320
with the other models since the

2070
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,880
computation tunnel models needs to be in

2071
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,840
sync

2072
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,679
and at this point that we don't have any

2073
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:06,239
major technical issues to move forward

2074
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,679
the document

2075
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,760
next slide

2076
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,400
so the next steps is of course to

2077
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,000
get feedbacks and comments from the

2078
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,560
working group and progress it

2079
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,280
accordingly we will keep alignment if

2080
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,040
there is any change in the authentic

2081
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,639
model which have an impact on the

2082
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,880
computation we will keep an alignment

2083
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
and we will complete the document adding

2084
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,719
the security management manageability

2085
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,560
considerations which are currently empty

2086
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,600
sections

2087
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,760
and we believe the document is now ready

2088
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,880
for working group adoption

2089
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,040
that's all thank you on to the empire

2090
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,600
competition

2091
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,480
yeah just just a very minor commenter

2092
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,320
keep in alignment with the ltn tunnel

2093
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,239
model but also probably the fat

2094
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,080
computation modeling

2095
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,120
computation

2096
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,000
yes you're right yes

2097
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,360
but yes i guess i agree i mean it's uh

2098
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,480
it seems to be something pretty

2099
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,400
pretty straightforward

2100
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,440
in

2101
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,080
in my opinion

2102
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,719
i guess we have a similar presentation

2103
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,639
for the optical one right

2104
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,880
yeah

2105
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,280
it is about the optical and next slider

2106
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,600
okay the document itself has not been

2107
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,639
updated yep

2108
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,120
okay the document has not been updated

2109
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,920
but as i said before we removed the

2110
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,080
computation otn so the document is now

2111
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,880
focused and will be progressed only to

2112
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,520
address uh w zone and flex degree the

2113
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,040
path computation

2114
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,199
like before it is

2115
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,320
an augmentation of the

2116
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,800
computation reference

2117
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,120
and reusing the common types in the llc

2118
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,679
1993 bs and alignment with the tunnel

2119
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,000
models for ws and reflected reader so

2120
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,320
also this one is quite straightforward

2121
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,920
even though we have a little bit more

2122
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,800
open issues given the complexity of the

2123
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,560
wwm technology we are discussing those

2124
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,880
issues together with the flexibility and

2125
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,440
tunnel model weekly calls on thursday

2126
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,239
and

2127
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,400
what we have done we have reviewed some

2128
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,960
use cases for the wm tunnel model and

2129
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,120
identify the some changes

2130
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,120
to the tunnel common attributes which

2131
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,679
has been reflected in the rsc 1993 b's

2132
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,360
draft update

2133
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,760
which is it is a grouping used by our

2134
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,840
model but it has been updated in that

2135
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,040
draft

2136
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,760
next slide please

2137
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,600
the major issue that uh yeah the major

2138
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,840
yeah

2139
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,440
uh

2140
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,440
okay yeah yes this is a major issue that

2141
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,320
you're facing now is

2142
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,560
whether we are able to merge the ws and

2143
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,320
flexibility composition modes in the

2144
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,760
current mod in the current graph we have

2145
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,960
two modes

2146
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,719
and we can see that there are some

2147
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,800
things which are different like the

2148
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,639
label the w zone and flexibility

2149
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,280
specific labels but there are a lot of

2150
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,719
items which are in common within

2151
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:02,560
www specific constraints like

2152
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,320
osnr margin and layer zero tunnel common

2153
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,480
attributes are really really the same

2154
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,560
between the two models and and there is

2155
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,280
a desire to try to see if you can merge

2156
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,600
these two modes into one model we have

2157
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,840
the similar discussion also for in the

2158
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,360
context of the tunnel model whether we

2159
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,480
can merge

2160
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,000
also doubles and flexibility tunnel

2161
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,080
modes so the suggestion here is maybe we

2162
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,320
need to investigate

2163
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,480
defeat the technical impact whether this

2164
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,400
is possible for both tunnel and pac

2165
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,400
computation and then we can bring the

2166
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,600
option to the working group and

2167
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,199
hopefully have the common

2168
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,600
approach between composition and tunnel

2169
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,639
model on merging the the two little

2170
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:41,679
modes

2171
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,960
the wizard and flexity part

2172
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,199
next slide

2173
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,040
okay what are the next steps okay is

2174
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,120
still to progress the worker getting

2175
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,360
feedbacks and comments on any part of

2176
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,880
the document

2177
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,560
we need to do some editorial update to

2178
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,880
remove what is now moved to the other

2179
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,280
draft to avoid any overlapping

2180
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,199
we have to evaluate

2181
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,280
this option to merge the two modus into

2182
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,639
one model and and as i said before we

2183
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,639
since we are we need to keep alignment

2184
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,880
with ws on flexibility tunnel modes and

2185
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,360
the rfc bs as well as the

2186
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,360
computation model in the teaser so if

2187
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,280
there is any impact there with any

2188
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,960
change there which impact this model we

2189
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,719
need to take into account and other

2190
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,480
security manageability considerations to

2191
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,920
the document

2192
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,760
never even if there are more open issues

2193
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,199
here than the previous law and the

2194
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,040
previous draft i think we think this

2195
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,560
this open issue can be addressed through

2196
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,000
normal working group

2197
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,560
process so we think this draft is also

2198
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,440
really for working group adoption

2199
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,678
thanks

2200
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,040
thank you

2201
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,719
yeah i mean

2202
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,840
you already said that i mean uh

2203
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,679
ideally we should try to keep an

2204
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,920
alignment between the tunnel models and

2205
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,520
the fat computation models if we merge

2206
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,159
zone and flexigrid on one side we need

2207
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,119
ideally to merge it and also also on the

2208
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,159
other

2209
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,119
uh

2210
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,040
personally i had to

2211
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,320
look at it and my personal opinion

2212
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,320
is is that uh

2213
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,920
a merger

2214
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,920
would would be possible i don't see any

2215
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,560
major uh major issues speaking about

2216
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,639
both the tunnel model and and the part

2217
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,719
complication models

2218
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,400
i don't know if if if you have found

2219
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,800
anything that could be

2220
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,040
a show stopper here for the merge

2221
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,239
have you eaten

2222
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,480
uh yeah it's just to understand the

2223
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,040
implication

2224
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,760
okay

2225
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,199
great

2226
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,599
thanks

2227
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,119
now we have the last

2228
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,400
presentation of the day

2229
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,880
iowa again

2230
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,920
please

2231
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,840
again

2232
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,639
that describes a problem statement and

2233
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,480
identified gaps

2234
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,440
when we are to connect

2235
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:32,320
[Music]

2236
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,199
you

2237
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,639
mute yourself

2238
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,400
there's a lot of echoes

2239
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,159
okay so um a recap of uh what is the

2240
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:45,679
motivation for this draft uh basically

2241
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,880
it's it's simple um the cloud traffic

2242
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,080
can be carried over ip based in networks

2243
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,520
from end user to uh to the to the cloud

2244
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,719
but um with the with with that we could

2245
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,000
also um carry the traffic over uh uh and

2246
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,880
underlay uh optical networks uh to

2247
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,880
achieve uh high quality and premium

2248
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,480
services uh such as you know cloud vr

2249
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,199
premium leased alliance etc

2250
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,520
and um this uh this approach uh is not a

2251
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,840
replacement of ip based

2252
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,480
solution but more complements what has

2253
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,360
been

2254
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,400
uh available with the ip based network

2255
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,000
system

2256
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,360
so the

2257
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,600
traditionally speaking the connections

2258
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,719
in in otn networks are more like

2259
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,880
pre-configured aesthetic

2260
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,600
with a fixed mapping

2261
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,679
between the client services

2262
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,280
to the

2263
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,280
ogn connections

2264
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,159
in the network so now with with the

2265
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:50,480
cloud-based traffic um the traffics are

2266
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,239
more uh dynamic

2267
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,400
uh so in order to make the optical

2268
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,199
network um to better support uh

2269
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,639
cloud-based services uh we would want to

2270
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,400
make the ogn

2271
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,520
more

2272
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,880
dynamically configured

2273
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,679
and because that we are looking into

2274
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,320
the the gaps with

2275
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,520
current

2276
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,679
control plane support for um

2277
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,280
otn networks

2278
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,000
next the page

2279
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:23,840
okay so

2280
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,360
a quick update a summary of the updates

2281
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,159
so

2282
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,639
before this revision

2283
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,440
we spend quite some chapters talking

2284
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,280
about the use cases

2285
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,400
which

2286
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,040
a lot of the use cases are actually

2287
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,239
asking for requirements for uh

2288
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,800
for otm-based data plane

2289
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,239
uh so this is not the focus for ietf so

2290
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,280
we have

2291
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,560
moved uh and consolidated all those use

2292
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,639
cases into a description of within the

2293
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,719
overview section and we clearly state

2294
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,040
that the data plan requirements are out

2295
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,520
of the scope for for this draft

2296
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,600
uh also in this

2297
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,400
revision we added a gap analysis

2298
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,880
for the current control plan protocol

2299
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,920
and we also started adding uh some

2300
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,520
framework description

2301
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,280
um for this um for this uh draft

2302
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,239
next page please

2303
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:28,000
okay so from the requirement perspective

2304
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,960
uh so cloud services are usually

2305
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,719
uh hosts hosted

2306
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,159
in multiple

2307
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,119
clouds

2308
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,519
that are

2309
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,800
in different locations and in order to

2310
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,119
support that we need to um

2311
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,800
we need to support

2312
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,639
multi-cloud access

2313
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,239
and that multi-cloud access could be

2314
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,360
done by

2315
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:52,320
running layer 2 vpn or layer 3 vpn over

2316
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,960
otn

2317
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,119
so this uh

2318
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:58,719
so the support

2319
01:39:58,719 --> 01:39:59,840
for

2320
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,719
the p2mp and mp2mp

2321
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:05,280
connections can be done by

2322
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,840
by layer two and layer three

2323
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,320
with otn typically we

2324
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,159
we still have just

2325
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,400
point-to-point connections

2326
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,760
but

2327
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,480
the potentially we could have

2328
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,199
the control plane support also for p2mp

2329
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:26,320
and mp2mp directly over the otn networks

2330
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,119
next page

2331
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:31,920
so

2332
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,800
one

2333
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,320
one of the key

2334
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,040
problem with current otn is if it's

2335
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,080
if it's

2336
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,119
all

2337
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,119
static and pre-configured

2338
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,840
then when there's a change in cloud

2339
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,159
traffic we will need to

2340
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,040
ask

2341
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,800
the network operator or uh or some tools

2342
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,040
to configure the network in order to

2343
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,360
meet the change in traffic

2344
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,080
um so that's uh where uh so the the the

2345
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,040
thought is okay if we have the otn

2346
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,400
network to

2347
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,280
be able to understand um that what is

2348
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,800
the current uh

2349
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,800
traffic coming into

2350
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,600
uh coming into otn and what is their qrs

2351
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,840
requirements then we could adjust uh

2352
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,480
dynamically otn bandwidth

2353
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,560
and the ogn

2354
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,600
tunnel

2355
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,800
the connections through the otn network

2356
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,480
to make

2357
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,280
to better support the um the the client

2358
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,480
traffic

2359
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,280
uh doing that requires um the

2360
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,560
uh the

2361
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,159
so the otn uh edge devices uh to be able

2362
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:42,960
to

2363
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,760
sense some uh information about the

2364
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,400
traffic and exchange

2365
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,639
the reachability as well as the declined

2366
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,080
information associated with the pe nodes

2367
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,719
and in order to be able to dynamically

2368
01:41:58,719 --> 01:41:59,520
map

2369
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,920
the client services onto

2370
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,199
onto either existing otn connections or

2371
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:06,320
it could

2372
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,960
start creating dynamic odn connections

2373
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,320
on the fly

2374
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,159
and we are looking into

2375
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,199
how

2376
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,600
the current control plane can do that

2377
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,560
uh next page

2378
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,400
um so

2379
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,560
as we said like um there's potentially a

2380
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,480
gap with the current control plane

2381
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,719
protocols in order to

2382
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:30,960
communicate the client information

2383
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,639
between the otm

2384
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,360
otm pe nodes

2385
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,520
and doing so

2386
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,159
so if we

2387
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,080
exchange information directly between

2388
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,960
the otm p nodes um you know if you look

2389
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,119
at the network you would have to create

2390
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,480
like a measure of

2391
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,960
communication between the p nodes

2392
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,840
but so instead we could uh use a

2393
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,679
reflector such as the controller

2394
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,760
to help with the exchange

2395
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,960
and

2396
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,960
so there needs to be a protocol between

2397
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,840
the

2398
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,080
pe nodes and

2399
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,400
and the controller between the p nodes

2400
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,040
and the controller to do this job

2401
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,239
so

2402
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,600
there are

2403
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,920
some possible solutions

2404
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,080
protocol solutions available

2405
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,239
in the ccap space

2406
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,000
psap ls

2407
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,960
or bgpls it could could potentially

2408
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,159
serve the

2409
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:27,840
purpose

2410
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,639
now with the optical network

2411
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,000
so we

2412
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,760
typically there's no bgp support on the

2413
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,679
otn

2414
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,360
devices because

2415
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,679
also

2416
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,440
i think this is this is not an updated

2417
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,239
version of the draft but anyhow so

2418
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,719
basically there's no bgp extension

2419
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,040
support for optical

2420
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,159
networks

2421
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:57,520
and um that and we believe uh with pc

2422
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,960
pls it could be a better candidate

2423
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,920
for the extensions

2424
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:07,638
next page

2425
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,800
okay so in order to support that uh what

2426
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,119
we need to do is under on pe nodes we

2427
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:16,719
need to identify what type of services

2428
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,360
are coming into the otn network this

2429
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,639
could be and this could be done by

2430
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,000
inspecting

2431
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,800
for example packet headers that

2432
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,000
arrives at an ogn pe nodes

2433
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,400
and the information such as source and

2434
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,119
destination mac source and destination

2435
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,480
ip address

2436
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,760
the vrf

2437
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,600
identifier and vlan id etc could be used

2438
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,199
to

2439
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,040
to identify

2440
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,360
the type of service

2441
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,040
and then with that service information

2442
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,000
the otn network could

2443
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,520
map

2444
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,000
create a mapping between the type of

2445
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,679
service and

2446
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,600
onto an existing otn tunnel

2447
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,400
or

2448
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,880
if needed it needs it can be

2449
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,000
it can create a dynamic otn tunnel

2450
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,719
within the within the network and um

2451
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,400
even even further

2452
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,840
uh if um it sends that the

2453
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,320
the traffic demand from the client

2454
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,600
has changed uh so it could actually

2455
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,040
make a um some dynamic bandwidth change

2456
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,480
uh on a

2457
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,639
bandwidth adjustment on an existing

2458
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,920
origin tunnel

2459
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,320
to meet the demand of the of this of the

2460
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,639
client service

2461
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:39,440
next page

2462
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,119
so um

2463
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,719
yeah i think this this one has already

2464
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,840
been mentioned uh the the service

2465
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,000
information could be reported

2466
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,600
uh to the

2467
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,840
uh the controller and exchanged between

2468
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:58,159
the the pe nodes

2469
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,400
so when the psat protocol

2470
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,719
is considered then we could define

2471
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,000
extensions

2472
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,119
as a p type report message

2473
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,839
next the page

2474
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,360
also on the configuration of service

2475
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,880
mapping um the um we need a control

2476
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,719
plane extension to

2477
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,760
push the mapping table between uh

2478
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,239
between

2479
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,679
between the service

2480
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,280
to uh odu connections from between the

2481
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,520
two pe nodes as well as between the p

2482
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,199
nodes and the controller which server

2483
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:37,119
says in the reflector

2484
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:38,560
um

2485
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,119
and uh in that case when the psat

2486
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,400
protocol

2487
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,480
is considered then we could define

2488
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,400
extension as a p-sub-update message

2489
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,119
next page

2490
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,280
yeah so just

2491
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,360
a few next steps

2492
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,560
we could

2493
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,159
consider to

2494
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,560
integrate the framework

2495
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,679
section into this draft which we have

2496
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,199
already started

2497
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:06,719
working on it

2498
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,280
with this revision and then

2499
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,000
we'll prepare the draft um to

2500
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,199
ask for working group adoption

2501
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:19,440
um and also i would like to call

2502
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,040
for interest and

2503
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,400
any anyone

2504
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,199
interested in his draft to

2505
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:28,000
join the work and contribute to the

2506
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,280
uh to the to the to this draft and

2507
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,199
we also would like to solicit the

2508
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,760
comments from the working group

2509
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,520
and then based on that we could discuss

2510
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,600
start discussing about potential

2511
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,000
protocol extension

2512
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,239
i believe this is the next the last page

2513
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,520
yeah okay thank you

2514
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,679
any comments or

2515
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:56,000
suggestions

2516
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,480
thank you

2517
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,840
i i have

2518
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,920
uh we have two questions probably two to

2519
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,000
two silly ones

2520
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,639
the the first one is uh

2521
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:11,600
um

2522
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:17,280
so you're saying that the bgp is not uh

2523
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:22,560
commonly used in uh otn uh otn devices

2524
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,840
because it's an overkill i mean pgpls

2525
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:31,040
is much lighter i i thought it was uh

2526
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,639
uh

2527
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,239
pretty much uh

2528
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,400
uh

2529
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,960
common to have at least the bgpls i'm

2530
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:42,000
not speaking about b2b but bgpls in uh

2531
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,520
on devices isn't that

2532
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,800
yeah this is uh as far as i can um as

2533
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,159
far as i know

2534
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,199
um

2535
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:54,239
there is there is not much of a bgp use

2536
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,960
in optical networks and also like i said

2537
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,840
there's

2538
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,800
there's

2539
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,600
no

2540
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,880
extensions

2541
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,199
for optical networks in bgp or bgpls

2542
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:07,679
so that that's probably another gap

2543
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,400
that prevents bgp from being used

2544
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:14,519
in in optical domain

2545
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:16,159
okay

2546
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:17,679
and the other question so we have

2547
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,960
requirements like multi-cloud access

2548
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,960
then we have uh

2549
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,159
um service identification and mapping i

2550
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,480
mean going through

2551
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,480
going through the presentation i had the

2552
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,719
feeling that this is uh not very

2553
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:36,960
different from audi and slicing is it

2554
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,560
uh this is uh

2555
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,480
well

2556
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:48,320
i mean otn slice is uh could be

2557
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:49,199
an

2558
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:50,800
application

2559
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,000
uh

2560
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,560
so you could create an otn slice by

2561
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,040
using the support for this

2562
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,760
cloud to

2563
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,080
user to cloud

2564
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,719
mapping this is basically this describes

2565
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,639
a possible implementation at the control

2566
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:09,679
plane

2567
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,840
to support uh

2568
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,159
one type of voltage and slice if you if

2569
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,080
you consider that

2570
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,440
but the

2571
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,239
the

2572
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:21,520
uh the use of this work is mainly

2573
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,480
to

2574
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,800
uh introduce the

2575
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,000
the

2576
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,280
service

2577
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,679
driven capability for otn so that

2578
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:35,599
you know we could better support

2579
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,960
cloud-based services by directly running

2580
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,599
that over otn networks

2581
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,639
so basically without without audience

2582
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,639
creating otn slices

2583
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,119
you could still

2584
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,239
use this capability to support to carry

2585
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:55,920
otn carry data data centered

2586
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,800
oriented traffic

2587
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,360
i don't know if i made it

2588
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,480
more yeah yeah actually yeah

2589
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,119
i don't know if uh slicing is a subset

2590
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,760
of this scenario or or this scenario is

2591
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,639
uh

2592
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:14,639
uh uh

2593
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:17,119
is the other way around is this scenario

2594
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,119
is a subset of slicing but i mean this

2595
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:20,960
is something that we can discuss

2596
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,920
we have two people in the queue yelina

2597
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,239
please

2598
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,639
i think we need some uh calculation

2599
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,119
among several concepts one is uh the

2600
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:38,239
idea presented by iowa and another is

2601
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:39,360
the

2602
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,360
the layer one ot layer one vpn and also

2603
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,119
the third one the uh

2604
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:48,719
otn slicing just uh danielle mentioned

2605
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:51,040
uh to my understanding the differences

2606
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,520
between the for example the layer one

2607
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,360
vpn and this idea is that um actually we

2608
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,000
are the same using otn as the underlay

2609
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,719
plane underlay layer of the network but

2610
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:05,440
for the overlay network i think for l1

2611
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,280
vpn it is a

2612
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,080
kind of carrying layer 1 services

2613
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,280
but in this idea i see a lot of

2614
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,920
layer 2 layer 3 services because data

2615
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:19,119
centers always use the layer 2 layer 3

2616
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:22,400
services layer 1. so i think that's the

2617
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,639
in my understanding that the key

2618
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,080
differences

2619
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,040
between layer 1 otn sorry layer 1 vpn

2620
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,040
and this idea

2621
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,239
and for network slicing

2622
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:37,119
my understanding is that now slicing is

2623
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:40,400
only for the otn resources itself

2624
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,840
not touching

2625
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,199
on the

2626
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,880
overlay layer

2627
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,199
i'm not sure if i understand correctly

2628
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:47,920
but

2629
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,440
maybe i could

2630
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,639
the author of this document of this uh

2631
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,560
document could check

2632
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,840
yeah that's my comments thank

2633
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,119
you uh

2634
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:00,800
yes

2635
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,360
to um respond to your comments yes so

2636
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,080
the otn slicing does not capture it does

2637
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,000
not care what kind of services is

2638
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,880
running

2639
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,080
uh it just captures the requirement for

2640
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,040
that

2641
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:13,920
for

2642
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,040
let's say a qos of the slice

2643
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,119
and then um as

2644
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,119
i mean for me

2645
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:22,560
this work

2646
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,199
could be used to serve as the

2647
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:28,560
realization of a slice in the in the otn

2648
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,320
network with control plane

2649
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,239
okay groove

2650
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,480
uh regarding the work that you are

2651
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,080
suggesting uh extension for pisa

2652
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,400
are they really audience specific or are

2653
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,320
they quite general like some of the

2654
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,880
things that i see which is saying

2655
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,760
identification for slice that would be

2656
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,599
common whether it is

2657
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,400
uh like you know normal uh network or it

2658
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,880
is otn so just think about that as well

2659
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,239
it's because the work is already

2660
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,480
happening and if you have any specific

2661
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,599
requirement maybe we can uh try to have

2662
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:11,520
one extension which takes care of

2663
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,000
everything rather than having audience

2664
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,159
specific piece of extensions for things

2665
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,520
which are actually going to be quite

2666
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,920
generic

2667
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:24,560
yes uh drew good comments um i i think

2668
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:25,360
uh

2669
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,480
the a lot of the definitions uh are uh

2670
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,280
should be common um

2671
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,560
so i i so i agree with you we need to

2672
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,040
define the the extensions as common as

2673
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,599
possible um it's not it's not i think

2674
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,760
it's not otn uh

2675
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,199
specific

2676
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,199
but could be used by

2677
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,080
by this scenario to identify the type of

2678
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,559
services

2679
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,199
okay

2680
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,199
yes

2681
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:04,880
you know okay since there is time i take

2682
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,400
the opportunity to answer to the

2683
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,480
question from daniele i think that it is

2684
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:13,199
both the subset that you mentioned in

2685
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:16,320
other words i i think that this solution

2686
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,480
can be a one way to realize an audience

2687
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,840
license so this is a subset of slicer

2688
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,400
but ots licensing can be one way to

2689
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,320
request

2690
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,639
the to express the intent for a service

2691
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:30,960
that is realized by this solution but

2692
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,800
maybe other way to request this service

2693
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,159
to be realized

2694
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,400
so it's both and a subset of this

2695
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:39,280
license is accepted of these

2696
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,679
thank you

2697
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,599
okay thank you

2698
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,840
make sense thanks for the qualification

2699
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,520
so given this is the last session of the

2700
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,159
atf meeting i think you would be happy

2701
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:58,080
to have five minutes back and

2702
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,400
either uh

2703
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,239
run to the airport or

2704
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,880
go for dinner if you are in europe and

2705
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,239
go to sleep if you are in asia

2706
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:13,959
thanks a lot everyone

2707
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,360
bye

2708
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,920
bye bye

2709
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:21,840
[Music]

2710
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,400
bye thank you

2711
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:32,040
thank you bye
