like in general we have this mailing

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
list ib ib.org that is the recommended

113
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
way but

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
and we have some more specific ones such

115
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,520
as architecture discuss for

116
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
long discussions and for liaisons we

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,440
have another list but also feel free to

118
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,759
grab an iab member here in the hallways

119
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,200
we're

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
generally friendly

121
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
and you can recognize us by the red dots

122
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
we have on our badges

123
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,838
next slide

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,159
yeah so this is the boring part of the

125
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,440
meeting where we just give a couple of

126
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,200
updates so you know what we're doing

127
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
um we did manage to publish one rfc and

128
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
this one is actually important one it's

129
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
a new roc series

130
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,920
editor model it's done it's implemented

131
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
where it's off our

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
plate so we're not responsible anymore

133
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
and like i provide you more information

134
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
tomorrow in the plenary as well

135
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
um but then the documents we are

136
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
actually still responsible for we have

137
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
two workshop reports uh one is in the

138
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
rfc editor queue already and the other

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,519
one is in community feedback so that's

140
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,160
also done i guess feedback is most

141
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
useful for people who actually

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
participated in the in the workshop but

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
anyway if you want to read it and

144
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
provide any comments um we're we are

145
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
grateful for that

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
we have one technical document about

147
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
recommendations which we believe is

148
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
ready for community view um i don't

149
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
think the call went out yet but it will

150
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,279
very soon so so look out for that last

151
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
chance to comment on this document

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
um the ib thinks it's in good shape and

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,040
hopefully it's useful to the community

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
and

155
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
then we have one more document which is

156
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
under active discussion and we know that

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
this blockchain has provoked a lot of

158
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
discussion

159
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,000
and and there will be more

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
time for more discussion in the edm

161
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
program meeting which will be on

162

is working group is to think about how

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
we can improve the process of making

175
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,959
protocols and documenting them

176
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,240
and we write documents aimed at

177
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,040
this

178
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
and we're focusing on one of those

179
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,560
documents which is uh draft ib protocol

180
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
maintenance

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
which talks about

182
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
when

183
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
it might be a good idea to use the

184
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
robustness principle and when it might

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,880
not be and so we're having a

186
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
thursday morning meeting from 9 to 10

187
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
a.m

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,880
in the ib office on the floor below if

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
anyone is interested in that topic

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
please come and chat we had some really

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
good discussion on architecture discuss

192
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
and we're looking to publish this

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
document soon

194
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
so we're really encouraging folks to

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
come share opinions

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,880
um

197
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
thanks

198
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
yeah maybe one more comment so this is a

199
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
small room it's an open meeting

200
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
everybody is invited to join but like if

201
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
you if you're not actively participating

202
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
you might not fit right so it would be

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
nice to to have those people in the room

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
who actually want to participate

205
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
okay and we have another technical

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
program which is the model t program or

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
the internet threat model program

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
and this we reported a couple of times

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
in the iab open meeting and the current

210
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
stages is that there was an interval

211
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
meeting um in april which discussed a

212
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,320
little bit about what are the next steps

213
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
for the program

214
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
um and since then there wasn't much

215
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
activity there was much discussion there

216
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,079
were like a few um small document

217
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,120
updates

218
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,959
um but we we're not sure what the way

219
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,160
forward is

220
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
um and so we are actively considering

221
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
closing this program now and that

222
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
doesn't mean that like all the problems

223
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
are resolved or it doesn't mean that the

224
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
discussion is ending here but it means

225
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
that probably the program doesn't

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
provide the right venue for this

227
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
discussion anymore

228
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
so even if we close the program

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
discussion can go on on the architecture

230
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
discuss list or hopefully some of this

231
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
will actually find its way

232
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
into the itf or maybe there's also room

233
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
in the irtf

234
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
but

235
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
the plan is to close a program so

236
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
we are we are still discussing this but

237
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
if you have any feedback you can provide

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
it to us now i mean not now but you can

239
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
send us an email you can also provide it

240
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,800
now but i guess that's uh

241
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
yeah

242
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,040
okay

243
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,079
um then like uh again back to the more

244
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,600
less technical more

245
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
administrative side um

246
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
i just we just want to mention quickly

247
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
that we actually created two new groups

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,079
and this is really kind of for

249
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,320
um just our internal

250
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
um

251
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
support of our our functions so maybe

252
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
not that exciting for you but just like

253
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
for some transparency we have a new

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,480
group

255
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
uh for ietf and ieee coordination this

256
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
is actually not really a new group this

257
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,519
uh activity always existed we just like

258
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
home it now more officially on the data

259
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
tracker

260
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
so hopefully that provides more

261
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
visibility about the liaison work we're

262
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,680
doing there

263
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,720
um

264
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
and this is kind of it's uh

265
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
it's a it's a it's a closed mailing list

266
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,839
but it's like experts are invited on a

267
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,160
neat basis so it's like the moving group

268
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,199
of people working on the coordination

269
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
and then the other new program is the

270
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,440
iab ice policy coordination

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
group

272
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,199
and this is really just to

273
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
intensify our relationship with icehock

274
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,880
we have a liaison we talk to them quite

275
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
often and we thought that like having

276
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
having a group that can meet more often

277
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
and and can focus on topics and make

278
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
sure we don't miss anything important

279
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
will help us here so this is brand new

280
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
and and hopefully it will

281
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
improve our

282
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
relationship with isoc even more

283
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,399
okay

284
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
next is the zone update since last time

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,199
we added a slide on this because we

286
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
thought we want to

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
provide a little bit more

288
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
awareness about liaisons to the

289
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
community

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
not like a huge number of updates this

291
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
time but

292
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,760
at least there is the rsac committee

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
which is in the process of of

294
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
rechartering so maybe that's information

295
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
that's interesting for some of you

296
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,079
and then we will have a longer update

297
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,519
from scott our lisa manager to itu-t

298
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
this time

299
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
um to write provide a more broader

300
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
overview what's happening in this

301
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,040
organization so that's also something

302
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
new we're doing right now and we go from

303
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
like we start with i2ut this time and

304
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
then hopefully the next times we we give

305
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,720
you some more updates about other

306
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,040
organizations just in general to provide

307
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,120
more awareness and coordination between

308
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
the different organizations

309
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
okay one more part here and that's the

310
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
more exciting part

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
workshops we are

312
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
just send out a call for a workshop that

313
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
we're organizing in fall

314
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
and the workshop is on management

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
technics and encrypted networks

316
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,360
and we really want to discuss how

317
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,519
management can be improved in encrypted

318
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,839
networks and also like how management

319
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,360
can be more

320
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
secure eventually and actually support

321
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
user privacy and security

322
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
so what we're looking for

323
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,440
um is contributions about action

324
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
requirements um that are needed for

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,560
network management so things that like

326
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
are not only aspirational but like

327
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,600
actually can lead to changes um

328
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,959
and we're looking for people who are

329
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
interested in actually working on this

330
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,800
or provide um solutions or just uh

331
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
explain solutions that maybe have been

332
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
provided already

333
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
so the call is out there um please look

334
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
at the iab website if you there's more

335
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
text explaining more stuff

336
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
um and then if you want to participate

337
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
in this workshop

338

342
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,199
but if you submit a position paper you

343
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,040
have good chances to get invited but we

344
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
really want to know what your thoughts

345
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
are in advance so we can organize a nice

346
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
workshop

347
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
and then this is a little bit of heads

348
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
up uh we are discussing another workshop

349
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
uh

350
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
on i remember environmental impacts of

351
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
internet applications and systems this

352
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
call isn't out yet

353
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
um but it's coming very soon so the ib

354
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,759
already decided that we want to do this

355
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,120
the workshop will

356
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
happen in december likely so submission

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,560
will be a little bit later in october

358
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,839
and we're interested to actually

359
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
understand what the impact is what are

360
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
what are the right metrics to measure it

361
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
and what are the data that we have out

362
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
there and like what

363
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,279
what do we understand if you put

364
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
everything together so watch out for

365
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
this as i said the call is not out yet

366
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,959
but we will send it out very soon

367
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
okay

368
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
any questions on these updates

369
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,599
sorry we actually yep

370
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,599
um so i wish it were a question um it's

371
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,160
it's more uh input to the iab

372
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
uh i hope you don't close uh the model t

373
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
program instead i hope what the iab does

374
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
is inject a little energy into it um ib

375
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
has been a little passive about that

376
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,360
program

377
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
there are five drafts uh there is

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
community interest um

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
but what we seem to lack there is enough

380
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,679
energy

381
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,280
to keep the program

382
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
what the iab sees as a symptom

383
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
is something that i think the iab could

384
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,039
solve by generating some of the energy

385
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,799
the community has contributed some

386
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
drafts but we like you mentioned we had

387
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
the one interim meeting

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
that doesn't seem like enough to me so

389
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
my input to

390
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,559
my input to the iap on the model t

391
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,520
program is don't close it and if the

392
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
conversation takes place in the iab

393
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
about closing it

394
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,799
make sure that you have a place to go

395
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,120
for those documents right that you've

396
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,880
you've asked the community for input

397
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
you've got contributions

398
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
and you've closed the program please

399
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
make sure that you have a concrete plan

400
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
for what to do

401
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
with the contributions that you've

402
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,080
already got thanks

403
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
so i i well understand um that desire

404
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,760
and i understand that it's very um

405
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,520
not satisfying if we just close the

406
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,919
program and there's no follow-up but

407
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,480
what we see is that the

408
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
purpose of this program or the purpose

409
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
of a lot of the iab activities that we

410
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
do is to kind of trigger

411
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
a conversation in the community to uh to

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
point the community at gaps or topics

413
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,679
that think we think we need further

414
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
discussion so that's when we created the

415
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
program what we wanted to achieve and we

416
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
don't see this goal achieved so we don't

417
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
know like if keeping the program around

418
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,039
will achieve this goal

419
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,640
there are documents which have

420
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,480
contributed to the discussion

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
but i think a lot of these documents

422
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,400
were not um

423
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
were not considered as being uh

424
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
publicate public published on the iab

425
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,559
stream from the beginning so this might

426
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
not be the right venue anyway for these

427
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
documents

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
we had a discussion today

429
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
that we needed menu for these documents

430
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
um and i understand it's very

431
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
frustrating that i just like can't

432
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
create it for you but i don't think this

433
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
when you will be in the iab

434
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,840
and i can

435
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,760
only act in the iab i can't act in the

436
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
other part of the organization so i

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
think it's actually on you

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
to bring these documents to keep the

439
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,559
discussion going and bring these

440
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,840
documents

441
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
into its right place and one place we

442
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
discussed for example is also there are

443
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
some research groups which have

444
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
a relationship here like prg

445
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
or hrpc

446
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,240
so you might want to approach

447
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,039
these chairs in these groups or you also

448
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
want to maybe go to the sec area and

449
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,320
keep the discussion going there

450
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
thanks maria um

451
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
[Music]

452
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,320
so

453
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
we we see two people in the queue that

454
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
aren't in the virtual cue we'll allow

455
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,039
your questions now but please in the

456
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,720
future everyone join the virtual queue

457
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
we want to make sure we're fair with the

458
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
remote participants

459
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,520
and

460
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
yeah um

461
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,799
why

462
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,760
oh yeah yari since you're the chair do

463
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,720
you wanna

464
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
of the model t group are you responding

465
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
to the previous point

466
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,440
i mean if you're responding to the

467
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,960
previous point i think pl you you're

468
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
welcome to jump the queue let's let the

469
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,080
queue drain first i'll

470
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,159
thank you sounds good go ahead and

471
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,640
you can keep your mask uh when talking

472
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
just keep the microphone close it works

473
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
really well okay thanks

474
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
um so just to support what mike said but

475
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
more importantly for model please state

476
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,159
your name for the minute oh sorry

477
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,440
dominique lizansky i'm the author of two

478
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
drafts for model t on threat models um

479
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
and and threats

480
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
uh just to say i think just to say i

481
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
support what mark said but also just to

482
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,960
say i think it's not on us particularly

483
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
but on us collectively with the iab as

484
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
well the threat model has changed and my

485
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
drafts actually show that and there's

486
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,919
quite a lot going on in this area and i

487
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,679
would agree with mark and his comment on

488
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,840
saying that i think it needs support and

489
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
input and sort of zest i would say from

490
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,760
the iab as well as from the community

491
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
um and i haven't let my drafts expire

492
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
because there's quite a lot there that's

493
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,880
changed and that's going on at the

494
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
moment and i just wanted to to make that

495
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
interjection that i would really support

496
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
seeing this giving it another chance and

497
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
to make sure that we actually have a

498
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
place to discuss

499
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
these threats and these threat issues

500
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,919
that are coming up

501
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
and let's be honest it's not just about

502
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,840
you know private sector as well there's

503
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
a lot going on right now that we really

504
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,400
need to

505
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,720
take a look at in terms of threat models

506
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,520
so

507
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
this is exactly what we discussed today

508
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
it's it's important to have a place to

509
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
discuss this with community but that's

510
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
not what we're doing in the program in

511
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
the program we're a small group of

512
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
people discussing it and we're failing

513
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,520
to bring this to the community

514
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,039
so we need a different way to do it and

515
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,480
it might not be an iab program

516
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
rob wilson cisco so just a quick comment

517
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
on your workshop on the network

518
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
management which i think is great um but

519
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,240
when advertising that you might have to

520
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
emphasize network monitoring and

521
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,799
operations more than network management

522
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
in a sense because otherwise you may

523
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,480
find that network management itself

524
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
doesn't get affected by this and

525
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
actually it's monitoring the traffic so

526
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
just be clear when it's being advertised

527
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,320
to to put in the right people and make

528
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,840
sure people understand what's coming

529
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
hi i'm isham

530
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,559
you had a workshop on environmental

531
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
impact

532
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,520
on

533
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
whatever we do

534
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
does this include energy management and

535
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
sustainability

536
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
gary behind you can answer this question

537
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,120
what the person behind you can answer

538
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,360
this question

539
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,039
um yeah so so the the um the workshop on

540
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,480
uh environmental impacts uh it's under

541
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
preparation we expect that to be a

542
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
virtual workshop in in december and so

543
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
everybody should be easily able to

544
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
participate

545
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
uh you'll be needing to submit the

546
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,480
position paper and uh

547
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
you know um submissions that are

548
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
interesting from from the point of view

549
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,559
of the program committee will uh

550
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
will be accepted and we'll have a

551
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
discussion

552
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
yes it does include energy management

553
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
and sustainability

554
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
all right and i'm going to cut the cue

555
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,919
after yari here go ahead yari yes i just

556
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,080
wanted to come to the mic and and say a

557
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,799
few words about uh model t so

558
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,120
i i don't claim that i have all the

559
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,440
answers like i i mean i share the

560
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
pain that was expressed on the mic

561
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,679
previously um but um

562
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
i i i i probably would have used

563
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
slightly different words than than media

564
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
did uh so it's not not necessarily that

565
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
we're gonna close this and go away type

566
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
of thing it's it's more that you know we

567
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,720
see some opportunity for uh moving some

568
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,880
documents at least forward

569
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,520
um for instance some of them in in the

570
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
uh iab documents and

571
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
um continuing the discussion

572
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
architecture discuss lists so

573
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,559
it's um at least for some parts it can

574
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,159
be an opportunity for actually

575
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,320
completing the work rather than

576
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,400
you know telling people to go away but

577
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
there are other parts that that we don't

578
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
necessarily have an answer for so we

579
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,279
need to work on that and we will be

580
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
discussing one of the documents by the

581
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
way today later

582
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,760
yeah particularly um for documents that

583
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
we want to move forward in the iab

584
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,480
document we are looking for

585
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,159
recommendations for the community right

586
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
so this is the part

587
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,640
that makes most sense on the iap stream

588
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
scott i think you have to be very brief

589
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
because we are

590
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
yes i will be as brief as i possibly can

591
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,159
and still transfer some information so

592
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,320
greetings everyone i'm the scott

593
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,279
mansfield from erickson i am the itu-t

594
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,880
liaison

595
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
manager between the ietf and the itu-t

596
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
and also from the itu-t to the ietf so i

597
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
tend to write liaisons to myself quite a

598
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,279
lot

599
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,640
so what i've provided here and this is a

600
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
presentation that's up on the website so

601
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
i'm not going to read every word on this

602
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
slide people can read

603
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
i just want to point out a few things if

604
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,760
there's particular information that

605
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
you're looking for

606
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,279
and then i'm here all week so if you

607
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,159
need to discuss anything in here

608
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,400
a little bit more in depth just contact

609
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,000
me send me an email it's

610
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,279
scott.mansfield.erickson.com very easy

611
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,720
so

612
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
there are many things that we deal with

613
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,039
when we're talking between the itu-t and

614
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,559
the ietf

615
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,320
and so there's technical impact things

616
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
there's policy impact things there's

617
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
geopolitical impact things

618
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
so depending on what you're really

619
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,120
interested in

620
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
take a look at those things and then

621
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
decide if there's anything that you

622
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
might want to uh want to talk to me

623
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,039
about

624
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,600
for instance the itu-t focus

625
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,840
there's some topics there they they tend

626
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
the itu-t if you don't know

627
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,520
part of the itu part of the un they like

628
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
to look at things from the top down so

629
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
they always have

630
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,039
whatever the latest buzz word is there's

631
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,799
going to be a quantum thing or a digital

632
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
twin thing or whatever but what that

633
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,880
means to the itu

634
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
is different than what that kind of

635
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
thing means to the ietf

636
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,679
so it's important to keep that in

637
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,000
context so you go to next slide so when

638
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
i put i provided in here

639
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
and there's even more now there was even

640
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,000
a couple more liaisons that came in this

641
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
morning even after i sent you this

642
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
particular version of it but

643
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,440
go to the uh the liaison tracker

644
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,400
um that the online thing and you can see

645
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
all of them you can sort and so there

646
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,360
are several liaisons that we've received

647
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
lots of them are for information some of

648
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
them are for action

649
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
i chair a joint collaboration activity

650
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
on imt 2020

651
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
and that liaison just came in this

652
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,840
morning so

653
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
if there's any group that has work that

654
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
they're doing

655
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,000
associated with 5g or the transport of

656
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
5g

657
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,640
those are the types of things that we

658
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
would like you to send back to the itu

659
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,480
so we can keep a database of all the

660
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,399
work that's going on

661
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,840
mainly so that we can avoid duplication

662
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,880
of work if the itu-t knows that work is

663
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
going on in a particular area they don't

664
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,039
have to start it all over again right

665
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
so go to the next slide

666
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
just real quick so there's another

667
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
slider liaisons

668
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
there is uh actually this isn't the

669
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,960
newest well that's fine so there's a

670
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
whole bunch of drafts on trust in

671
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,039
quantum so if you like trust if you like

672
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,159
quantum

673
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,279
the itu-t study group 13 meeting just

674
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,679
happened the two the first two weeks of

675
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,720
july

676
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
they produced quite a bit of work these

677
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
are some recent drafts so the next slide

678
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
i'm going to do this and then so the

679
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,559
activities there are joint collaboration

680
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,480
activities and focus groups and

681
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,679
correspondence groups and road map style

682
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
work so if you don't know what those

683
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,720
things are you can come and talk to me

684
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,200
but the groups that are very active in

685
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,440
study group 13 right now are identity

686
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,559
management autonomous networks

687
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,760
machine

688
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,919
learning data sets

689
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,000
this is a new correspondence group

690
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
that's been created so that you can

691
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,200
discuss

692
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,559
how to how to standardize the transfer

693
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
of data set information when you're

694
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,640
dealing with machine learning

695
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,200
next slide

696
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
whole slew of new work is an eye chart

697
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,399
this is just study group 13. there are

698
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
11 study groups in itu-t there's a lot

699
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
to look at this is the newest work in

700
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,600
study group 13.

701
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,559
study group 20 is going on this week in

702
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
a couple weeks study group 17 which is

703
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
security is going on and then study

704
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
group 15 which is transport related is

705
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
going on in september lots of stuff

706
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,399
going on you can see that

707
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,000
these are the joint collaboration

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,360
agreement

709
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
links if you're interested in any of

710
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,480
these you can click on them and see what

711
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
their latest work is next slide

712
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
this is the information about quantum

713
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
information technology for networks

714
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
these are the deliverables that they've

715
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
already sent out so if you're interested

716
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,799
in that you might want to take a look at

717
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,880
that next

718
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
now from a geopolitical standpoint and

719
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
from an organization standpoint from

720
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,159
itu-t there are some humongous meetings

721
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,559
that have been going on because of covid

722
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,080
these meetings were supposed to take

723
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,039
place in 2020 and 2021

724
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,679
and 2022. well the meeting that was

725
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,679
supposed to take place in 2020 happened

726
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,679
a couple weeks a couple months ago and

727
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,159
it was called wtsa this is the one that

728
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,919
organizes the work for the itu-t

729
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,919
and so there's some hot topics there

730
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,919
what happened and some of the stuff that

731
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,600
that occurred if you're interested in

732
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,520
the resolutions or opinions or any of

733
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,039
the proceedings you can click on and

734
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,080
look at it there go next slide

735
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
wtdc was supposed to take place last

736
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,679
year

737
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
these are the things that uh came were

738
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,960
the hottest topics of discussion and

739
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,000
debate during the wtdc wtdc is for

740
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,640
itu-d

741
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,360
it's the development sector it's to help

742
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
connectivity across the world so you can

743
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,399
see

744
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,600
what happened there go next

745
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,080
upcoming is the plenty potentiary

746
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
meeting sounds very heavyweight

747
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,799
actually what it is it's the one that

748
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,279
elects the new secretary general of the

749
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,799
itu

750
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,039
so this is a big deal this meeting

751
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,960
happens it's three weeks it's in

752
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
budapest

753
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,880
no bucharest sorry

754
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
and the topics of this are

755
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
internet governance is a huge topic if

756
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
you care about policy if you want to see

757
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,159
what some of the stuff going on

758
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,480
in the world you can look at that link

759
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
there's uh the aai is going to be a big

760
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,440
topic things about openran and open

761
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,799
standards and open stuff there'll be

762
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,480
more discussions about that in high

763
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,519
level res high level uh resolutions

764
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,320
coming down the important thing that may

765
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
be lost on some people is the plenty

766
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,120
potentially is a treaty binding

767
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,600
meeting which means

768
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
laws can come out of this thing it's

769
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
something that matters to a member

770
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,320
states so if you go to the next

771
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
um upcoming meetings i've already said

772
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,760
those that's it

773
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
yep

774
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,159
thank you uh yeah look up the slides if

775
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,840
you have any uh questions follow the

776
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,679
link or talk to scott i think that's the

777
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,080
easiest way

778
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
so we're going to have a talk from yari

779
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
about data minis minimization

780
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,919
given that we're running a little bit

781
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
behind on the schedule we're going to

782
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,760
ask you to take questions on this talk

783
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,519
to the list and we're not going to do

784
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,360
them live right now

785
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
and i'd like to remember folks to please

786
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
wear their masks properly over their

787
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
nose and mouth in the session except

788
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,880
here right literally not here like your

789
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,760
exception um thank you so i'll try to be

790
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,159
brief um there's more to discuss but uh

791
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,399
let's let's do that on the list so this

792
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,080
is one of the drafts that has been

793
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
inspired by the model t work by the way

794
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,679
and there's there's more but this this

795
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,919
is one that we're discussing today um

796
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,279
and i actually believe that this is you

797
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,440
know potentially useful for for the iat

798
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
to adopt us as an iap document that

799
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,960
eventually an rfc um and that's why it's

800
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,279
sort of i'm asking that iab to adapt it

801
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,480
and

802
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,919
talking about it here

803
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,919
next slide please so the context for

804
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,080
this is that um the iab typically

805
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,679
doesn't like deal with detailed protocol

806
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,919
issues it deals with you know broader

807
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
topics like trends in the internet or

808
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,399
some

809
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,159
high level guidance for instance rfc

810
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
8546 which talks about protocol wire

811
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,559
images and how they

812
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,320
eventually get used if you have any

813
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,919
information that somebody will end up

814
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,600
using it

815
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,480
and the

816
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
our question was in the model t if

817
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,600
there's any guidance to give with

818
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,559
respect to data we share about users and

819
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,880
of course increased encryption will make

820
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,440
less parties

821
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,159
private to the information about users

822
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,559
because you you know you encrypt um

823
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
information flows but but you still

824
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,159
provide a lot of information to various

825
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,039
servers and services and maybe that's

826
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,720
too much and these services can also

827
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
share the information further either by

828
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,679
accident or through commercial reasons

829
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,240
what can we say about this

830
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,679
it's a hard problem but maybe there are

831
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,480
some things to say next slide please

832
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,159
so we came up with this

833
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,840
simple thing it's just called the data

834
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,320
minimization principle and and we're

835
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,840
trying to use the principle of least

836
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
privilege and sort of set it in the

837
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
protocol context

838
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
um just reading out allowed that

839
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,039
protocol participants should minimize

840
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,799
the information they share for instance

841
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,440
they should provide only the information

842
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,359
to each other that is necessary for the

843
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,599
function that they expect

844
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,639
to be performed by the other party

845
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
and if they if they say more information

846
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
than that then basically this wire image

847
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,639
thing applies that

848
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,399
you know information will get used even

849
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,399
at the servers even if you encrypted the

850
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,000
whole you know tcp flow or or quick flow

851
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
um so it's really simple but perhaps

852
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,359
needs to be said given that we are

853
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,320
sharing so much data the next slide

854
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,480
so you may ask how does it actually get

855
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,839
translated to

856
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,079
real technical works three examples and

857
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,159
there's probably more we can think of

858
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,239
new places to apply this

859
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,839
oblivious dns oblivious https

860
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,679
basically about giving full information

861
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,679
to any single participant so that that's

862
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,440
the clue there

863
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,280
privacy preserving measurements the ppm

864
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,399
working group

865
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,720
avoid giving a single user's data to any

866
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,560
party but still be able to provide

867
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,880
aggregate statistics for instance and

868
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,960
then end-to-end message encryption

869
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
between users

870
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,440
so that you may use some relays servers

871
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,200
that relay information but you don't

872
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
tell the servers the content of the

873
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
messages

874
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
but that's the destination where they

875
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
won't want to be relayed so pretty

876
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
simple stuff but but actually important

877
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
because we are sharing way too much

878
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
information in the internet today

879
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,480
so that's it and we're out of time

880
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,280
awesome thank you so much yari uh and so

881
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
if anyone has comments or questions

882
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,520
please send them on architeur on the

883
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,040
architecture discuss mailing list

884
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,799
all right

885
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,040
dr cabral thanks so much for coming over

886
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,119
to give an invited talk the floor is

887
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,520
yours

888
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,280
yeah so we we invited um dr cabral

889
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,440
he is a professor of economics and

890
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,520
international business at the university

891
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,119
of new york so it was a short drive but

892
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,640
it was quite spontaneously so like

893
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
really peter here

894
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,280
um and we invited you because of the eu

895
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,079
digital market act which was just uh

896
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,640
finished i think right very recently um

897
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,839
and this already triggered some

898
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,320
discussion in the itf there was the mimi

899
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,560
barbaroff yesterday evening and there

900
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,000
was a lot of discussion there already

901
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,359
and so we are really happy to have you

902
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,440
here as an expert and i can just

903
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
encourage everybody to take the

904
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,440
opportunity to ask any questions they

905
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
have now during the session is i mean we

906
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
have 25 minutes left so let's see how

907
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,720
far we get but also after the session

908
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
you will be around for a little bit

909
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,480
longer so yeah thanks thank you for

910
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,960
having me and and i'll try to be brief

911
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
so again i was next slide if you could

912
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,960
move i was going to just very briefly

913
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,599
introduce myself because i i'm not by

914
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,359
any means an expert in internet

915
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,599
infrastructure so to be very clear my

916
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
area of expertise is the study of

917
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
competition policy

918
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,760
and there's a lot of it on over the

919
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,280
internet and so there are a lot of

920
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,480
things that may be relevant for you

921
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
that's the reason primarily i'm here in

922
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,599
particular i uh co-wrote a report to the

923
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
european union in preparation of the

924
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,560
digital markets act which was approved

925
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,480
monday last week so this is all very

926
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,359
fresh

927
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,760
so next slide please um

928
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
i'm sorry if i'm starting from the zero

929
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
but basically as i said i i don't know

930
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,520
anything about infrastructure and i'm

931
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
primarily talking about

932
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
commerce over the internet so issues of

933
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
ip of competition and so forth those are

934
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,079
the issues that i deal with and those

935
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,680
are the issues that the digital markets

936
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,079
act and also the digital services act

937
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,320
which is the next one that's coming up

938
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
address and which i think are relevant

939
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
uh also for people dealing with

940
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,800
infrastructure so next slide please

941
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
um now being so ignorant of issues of

942
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,599
instruction i decided it might not be a

943
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
bad idea for me

944
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,760
not to assume any knowledge on your part

945
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,079
on issues of competition policy so i

946
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,560
apologize if i'm stating the obvious to

947
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,240
some of you but i'm going to start with

948
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,880
you know into antitrust 101 what is this

949
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,240
all about

950
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
by the way if you're not in north

951
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
america this is usually known as

952
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
competition policy but it's essentially

953
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,000
the same thing see you know a set of uh

954
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
institutions and laws that govern the

955
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
way

956
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,800
um commerce is done not just on internet

957
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,920
but more generally okay

958
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
some key players might be the antitrust

959
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
division of the u.s department of

960
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,240
justice or in europe dg comp the

961
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,079
directorate of competition which is

962
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,000
probably the most powerful directorate

963
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,920
in the european union and then there's a

964
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
whole set of of laws

965
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
one thing that's a bit peculiar of

966
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
competition policy and this may sound a

967
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,440
little strange to you

968
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,960
and if it does it is because it's

969
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,680
strange it's jurisdiction

970
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,119
so um

971
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,800
strictly speaking in practice i should

972
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,320
say

973
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
every competition authority in any

974
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,119
country in the world has jurisdiction

975
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,560
over pretty much every firm in the world

976
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,200
it sounds a little strange but it's true

977
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
so just a few months ago the united

978
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,800
kingdom blocked the acquisition

979
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,680
of giphy by meta so we have an

980
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,839
acquisition of two american firms and

981
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,079
that acquisition was blocked by a united

982
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,079
kingdom regulator

983
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,760
how come how did he find that

984
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,839
jurisdiction well to the extent that

985
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,920
meta and if you want to do business in

986
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
the uk

987
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,640
they have to follow their rules if they

988
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,720
say you cannot do that acquisition and

989
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,480
they cannot afford not to do business in

990
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
the united kingdom then they have to

991
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,560
follow up

992
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
whatever is imposed on them so this is

993
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
so much it's very different from what we

994
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,320
find in these meetings and in it because

995
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
it's not so much about

996
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
uh global cooperation it's it's a very

997
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
fragmented

998
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
next slide please

999
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
um just again

1000
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,000
three minutes for those of you are not

1001
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
aware of um competition policy has

1002
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,839
evolved a lot in the past 30 years in

1003
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,359
particular one thing that we've noticed

1004
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,079
is what my uh colleague tomafil pong

1005
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,240
refers to as the great reversal it used

1006
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
to be primarily a u.s based tradition of

1007
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,520
being very tough on how firms compete

1008
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
and so forth whereas europe did not have

1009
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
a lot of that and in past 30 years there

1010
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
was a complete reversal between the two

1011
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
sides of the of the atlantic and now

1012
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
it's the european union that's been

1013
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
really the leader in trying to enforce

1014
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
rules for a level play field in in

1015
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
commerce in general and in particular on

1016
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,040
internet and and i think this is

1017
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,560
particularly important when it comes to

1018
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,960
digital markets and that's survey when i

1019
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,599
finally i'm coming to next slightly uh

1020
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,040
my point uh which is the digital markets

1021
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,000
act

1022
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,839
this is all very fresh as i said it was

1023
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,880
approved on monday of last week so uh

1024
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,440
we're just living through it right now

1025
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,599
and and um

1026
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,960
the goal is to restore some level of

1027
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,319
competition

1028
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,040
in uh digital markets and what i mean by

1029
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
that is you know the usual suspects

1030
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
google and apple and amazon microsoft

1031
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,920
meta

1032
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
and then maybe other smaller platforms

1033
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,000
which are referred to in dma as the

1034
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,599
gatekeepers

1035
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,800
and i think

1036
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,560
if i had to divide the structure of the

1037
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,400
dma i would say there are three parts

1038
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
that are important to it one is defining

1039
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,760
who are these gatekeepers because we are

1040
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,359
first to say who are they we're going to

1041
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,800
be regulated

1042
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,680
second the list of do's and don'ts and i

1043
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,599
want to talk a little bit about that and

1044
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,599
finally how does this work in practice

1045
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,599
how do you implement this uh one thing

1046
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,119
is to have a law in theory the other

1047
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,480
thing is how this is going to work in

1048
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,079
practice so what i want to do in the

1049
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,359
next three slides or so is to go over

1050
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,560
these

1051
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,640
different parts in greater detail

1052
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,839
so gatekeepers um

1053
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,280
there's a bunch of articles that you

1054
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,920
find that um and i'm just giving you

1055
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,599
just a little bit of the tip of the

1056
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,240
iceberg it's basically you know it's

1057
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,440
basically

1058
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
as i said the usual suspects and

1059
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,200
basically come up with rules that would

1060
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,680
essentially include them so you have to

1061
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,800
be large you have to be uh

1062
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
entrenched power in indoors have

1063
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,240
dominated the market for quite some time

1064
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,880
um and you have to have a a core

1065
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,920
platform service so it could be a the

1066
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,359
google search engine could be

1067
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,560
social

1068
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,520
networks on facebook and so forth

1069
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,359
and there's an article article 15 1 that

1070
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,480
says that the commissioned european

1071
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
commission will um

1072
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,560
conduct market investigation to decide

1073
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,040
whether a certain corporation should be

1074
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
or should not be included as a

1075
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,599
gatekeeper and therefore subject to the

1076
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,040
regulations in the dma next slide please

1077
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,960
and the core of the dma and this is

1078
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,200
probably what you should probably pay

1079
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,599
attention to

1080
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,760
everyone should be is is chapter three

1081
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
which is the list of do's and don'ts

1082
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,280
let me just say that i mean if you ask

1083
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,119
me does this have the potential for

1084
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
being a big deal

1085
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,880
and my answer is no he says the

1086
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,280
potential being a humongous deal i mean

1087
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
this really could be a watershed moment

1088
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,880
in the history of the internet maybe i'm

1089
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,720
exaggerating and perhaps of course you

1090
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,000
guys have a different perspective which

1091
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,400
is infrastructure but in terms of the

1092
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,359
history of how google and microsoft and

1093
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
and facebook and so forth

1094
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,040
have been doing business i i feel i

1095
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
think could change radically in the next

1096
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
few years if this is really implemented

1097
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,720
okay so uh it's articles five and six

1098
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
there's a type where in there they

1099
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,520
basically have

1100
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
if i were to summarize article five

1101
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,560
things that you really have to do or

1102
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
cannot do and then things that

1103
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,040
maybe upon further investigation we may

1104
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,359
tell you not to do it and and let me now

1105
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,200
in the next slide please give you some

1106
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,960
examples of what those things might be

1107
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,760
just to give you an idea how

1108
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,960
revolutionary this could be if this is

1109
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,040
actually implemented

1110
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,520
uh no self-preferencing in ranking and

1111
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,880
in indexing

1112
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
so for example i mean of course

1113
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,599
there's allegations we don't know that

1114
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,319
amazon would favor its own products in

1115
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,800
listing them on on the page or that

1116
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,560
google there is some

1117
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,680
evidence of that would uh bring some of

1118
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,960
the uh

1119
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,520
affiliated services up on the organic

1120
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,680
search pages and so forth

1121
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,640
that's

1122
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,800
in the blacklist

1123
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,640
okay

1124
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,359
second huge this one friend which is the

1125
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,560
idea a legal term for um

1126
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,839
fair and nondiscriminatory

1127
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,880
fair and nondiscriminatory access to

1128
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,319
click and query data this is huge

1129
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
basically saying that google has has to

1130
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,720
provide click and query data or amazon

1131
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,640
whatever to third parties at a

1132
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,400
reasonable price of course what does

1133
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,839
reasonable mean you know i don't know

1134
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,480
this for lawyers to decide largely but i

1135
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,359
mean

1136
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,960
never like this is an important very

1137
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,839
important step

1138
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,960
interoperability there's

1139
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
a lot of instances where things will be

1140
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,240
important one of them that's dealt with

1141
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,440
in dma is for for example for messaging

1142
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,880
services

1143
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,599
so

1144
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,680
i may if i have a new the cabral

1145
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,880
messenger i may ask facebook to allow me

1146
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
to

1147
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
integrate it with their own messenger

1148
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,480
now of course the devil is going to be

1149
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,839
in the details how that's going to be

1150
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,000
done but at least the idea is is that

1151
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,839
that this should be a

1152
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,599
important same thing for app stores

1153
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,319
which are basically a huge monopoly by

1154
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,960
apple and google right now

1155
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
uh no restrictions on transactions off

1156
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,319
the platform this is getting a little

1157
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,720
technical but for example amazon does

1158
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,880
not allow uh sellers who sell through

1159
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,319
amazon uh to set a lower price elsewhere

1160
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,240
sounds a little crazy it is crazy but

1161
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,079
but it is true it's one thing that they

1162
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:32,880
ask

1163
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,680
um

1164
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,240
and then data portability if i create

1165
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,440
now a cabral uh selling network i can

1166
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
tell um

1167
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,680
um

1168
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,160
amazon that if amir for example she had

1169
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,280
an account on amazon i want amazon to

1170
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,839
give me that data of her past purchases

1171
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,240
so that she can have all of that you

1172
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,960
know recommendations that uh uh she had

1173
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,119
on amazon i can have on my own cabral

1174
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,960
platform again

1175
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,520
um no precedence of of regulations of of

1176
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
this strength uh i i don't think in the

1177
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,280
history of the internet and and that's

1178
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
what the dma is asking for

1179
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,359
um and finally uh notification

1180
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,160
acquisitions since 2000

1181
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,280
gathem the five top firms have made

1182
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,079
close to 1 000 acquisitions and only one

1183
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,160
was blocked that was last year and it

1184
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
was giphy the acquisition of giffy by

1185
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,760
mata so these are just some of the items

1186
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,440
that are covered in the lists of do's

1187
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,319
and don'ts that just went into effect on

1188
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,040
monday of last week and as i said i mean

1189
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,000
if this is applied this is really a what

1190
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,640
a shed in the history of of of the

1191
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,960
internet as far as i can tell next slide

1192
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,079
please

1193
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,359
so um non-compliance again this is huge

1194
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,319
the commission has the rights of uh

1195
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,440
article 21.1 of conduct on-site

1196
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,599
instructions i mean i think it's pretty

1197
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,280
draconic but

1198
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,040
it's written today i i still don't know

1199
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
exactly how to interpret that but i i'm

1200
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,400
interpreting the way it's in there that

1201
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
i can just walk in the affirmative and

1202
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,480
and ask you for the data for your emails

1203
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,960
for everything

1204
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,720
and basically you know this basically

1205
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,200
just implementation in a decade finds up

1206
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,359
to 10 of turnover this may not seem like

1207
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,480
a lot but

1208
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
it is a lot

1209
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,200
i mean it could be i don't know into

1210
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,760
tens of billions of dollars of fines

1211
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,280
so that potentially could be it could be

1212
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
big next slide please

1213
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,440
and so it's on as of last week

1214
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,599
okay

1215
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,119
i think this has a potential of being

1216
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,480
huge

1217
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,680
but of course the devil is in the

1218
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,720
details

1219
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,559
how's this going to work yeah and and i

1220
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,400
think one very important difference in

1221
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,760
respect to the past in the past

1222
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,680
competition policy has been left to

1223
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,800
lawyers

1224
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
and some economists

1225
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,200
and i think one of the reasons why this

1226
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
is very revolutionary this is going to

1227
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,599
create an enormous demand for people

1228
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,040
like you

1229
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,119
because i mean how on earth can the

1230
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,760
european commission know that amazon

1231
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,880
is giving preferences on no i need to

1232
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,200
have ways of of um

1233
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,960
i don't know finding out whether they

1234
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
are

1235
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,160
giving access uh uh

1236
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,280
interoperability whether they're

1237
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,599
actually sharing the right data uh and

1238
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,720
so forth i mean there's so many ways of

1239
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,119
of not following the rules and this is

1240
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,720
not something that a lawyer can figure

1241
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
out this is something that will require

1242
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,839
a lot of expertise and and this is to me

1243
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,599
is the biggest problem the commission

1244
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,760
has very limited staff and in particular

1245
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,400
very limited technical staff

1246
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
and i think this will be the biggest

1247
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,440
challenge to see whether they can

1248
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,839
actually face up to the big giants and

1249
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,640
and force them to to uh to to

1250
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,160
apply the rules that are being defined

1251
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,960
by the dma so we'll see in the next few

1252
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,400
years and let me just say that in

1253
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
addition to dma another big thing that's

1254
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,119
coming out is the digital services act

1255
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,440
and that covers issues like liability

1256
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,040
free speech

1257
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
and things of that sort so non-technical

1258
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,559
issues but nevertheless very important

1259
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,599
issues by large digital corporations and

1260
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,200
i think like i said

1261
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,880
um

1262
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,000
i think it's great that the european

1263
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
union is taking a lead on that uh

1264
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,839
traditionally the u.s was really the

1265
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,720
country where competition rules were

1266
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,559
more enforced and more likely enforced

1267
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,000
but in the past few years things have

1268
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,160
kind of been reversed uh regulators in

1269
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,119
the u.s

1270
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,880
have essentially been asleep when it

1271
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,599
comes to antitrust and so it's probably

1272
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,200
a good thing that european union is

1273
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,800
taking on that role

1274
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,920
so thank you and uh i'll be happy either

1275
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,839
now or later on perhaps i can stay here

1276
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,680
for a little longer and answer answer

1277
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,079
questions you might have about the dma

1278
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,680
again thanks for having me

1279
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,559
no thank you so much can we no actually

1280
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,400
we have questions so stay here don't run

1281
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,559
away

1282
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,520
so

1283
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,079
let's see wes kick us off

1284
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,079
thank you very much very interesting uh

1285
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,440
talk

1286
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,119
and i hope you know that it actually

1287
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,720
comes true to some extent that it

1288
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,680
promotes interoperability at layers

1289
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,520
uh higher than we we typically see in

1290
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,200
the ietf these days you know everybody

1291
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,599
wants wild garden log lock-ins and you

1292
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,400
know they use base http and tcp and the

1293
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,240
layers that we know about and then it

1294
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,520
sort of stops because they're trying to

1295
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,839
get vendor lock in what i worry about

1296
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,480
and what i'm curious about is

1297
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,240
does the document which i have not read

1298
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,520
i apologize

1299
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
uh figure out a way to avoid some of the

1300
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,440
legal loopholes right so you talk about

1301
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,040
you know they want to mandate instant

1302
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,720
messaging right i could very quickly see

1303
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,160
the companies going okay we're no longer

1304
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,760
doing instant messaging we're now doing

1305
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,960
something different

1306
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,319
right so they're always trying to keep

1307
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,559
one step ahead and get you know sort of

1308
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,480
more lock-in

1309
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,640
is there any sort of protections of you

1310
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
know that the list is not this fixed

1311
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,160
list that you know will is that going to

1312
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,240
be out of date in three years so i think

1313
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,839
you're asking the right question and i i

1314
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,520
i don't have an answer i mean the answer

1315
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,680
is no it doesn't have any air

1316
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,960
and there are a lot of loopholes i mean

1317
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,319
one is for example encryption you can't

1318
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,160
say that well i'm what's up and you know

1319
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,240
i'm i have this technology for

1320
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,839
encryption and and if you don't have

1321
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,160
that i'm not going to allow you to to

1322
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
interoperate with what i'm just giving

1323
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,800
you as a possible example they're

1324
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,640
they're mirrored ways and of course the

1325
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
large corporations have a lot more

1326
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,880
um technical people who can who can who

1327
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,599
can do those sort of tricks and that's i

1328
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,440
think the reason why i i say that the

1329
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,200
devil is in the details whether the

1330
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,920
commission will be able to actually uh

1331
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,599
implement this in in a way that it's

1332
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,839
practical and that prevents all sorts of

1333
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,400
loopholes and and tricks that the large

1334
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,480
corporations may implement to the way

1335
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,839
with that and one of the problems that

1336
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,960
you also point out which i think is

1337
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,319
important i mean one possible downside

1338
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,280
of this

1339
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,880
is that they will just stop offering a

1340
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,400
lot of services i mean if that's how you

1341
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,880
want to do it then i'll stop doing it

1342
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,839
i

1343
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,359
don't think so

1344
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,280
but a lot of people of course i mean the

1345
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,640
large corporation's not already saying

1346
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,400
that it was part of the lobby

1347
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,760
by the last corporate oh well if you're

1348
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,440
going to start regulating us like this

1349
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,599
we're going to stop offering search

1350
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,480
on google well come on

1351
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,400
or it's like so i don't think it's a

1352
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
credible threat i'd just like to know

1353
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,119
you really scared me when you said

1354
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,480
companies going to start implementing

1355
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
their own encryption algorithms again to

1356
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,920
get around the interoperability problem

1357
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,040
i i'm now quaking

1358
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,160
hey stephen farrell thanks for having

1359
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,720
the talk that was good um so a related

1360
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,839
question is uh

1361
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,079
related question is how

1362
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,000
so the defining interoperability is

1363
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,319
obviously going to take a while um from

1364
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,400
the kind of regulatory side of it how

1365
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,160
would you how how would you see that

1366
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,640
process happening and how long might it

1367
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,720
take or is it just nobody knows yet

1368
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,400
so one thing that i did not mention is

1369
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,960
that the dma does uh include the

1370
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,559
possibility in fact

1371
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,160
suggest that there would be a dialogue

1372
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,760
with the corporations that are

1373
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,920
considered gatekeepers so as to

1374
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,280
implement that i mean i think the

1375
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,720
commission understands that they don't

1376
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,480
understand things and so uh the idea is

1377
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,000
that there will be some sort of a

1378
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,480
dialogue

1379
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,559
with the gatekeepers and perhaps some

1380
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
interested third parties i mean

1381
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,319
duckduckgo for example i mean they've

1382
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,559
been clamoring for for ages that they

1383
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,079
want access to uh indexing and so forth

1384
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,920
so my guess is that the commission will

1385
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,319
uh call google listen we we need to do

1386
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,760
something about this and then it will

1387
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,839
call duckduckgo as well to tell you know

1388
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,520
you guys are the experts tell us exactly

1389
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,680
what you need and and then negotiate

1390
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,119
that with them so

1391
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,480
dma does not have in detail exactly what

1392
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,200
this means just creates a platform as it

1393
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,680
were for this to be implemented

1394
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,440
largely by means of dialogue great

1395
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,800
thanks and as a follow-up i guess i

1396
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,079
presume there's no mention of things

1397
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,480
like the ietf so far in in that in those

1398
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,200
documents um

1399
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,960
you know i don't know it's a good

1400
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,640
question um

1401
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,319
i think there's a mention of third

1402
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,160
parties who will be

1403
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,079
relevant i don't know that there's iepf

1404
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,520
is mentioned

1405
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,440
specifically

1406
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,280
it should be because a lot of these

1407
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,920
things are going to amount to a

1408
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,359
technical

1409
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,640
interoperability details

1410
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,680
hi phil hanbaker great talk i you know i

1411
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,800
appreciate the informed discussion of

1412
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,839
this stuff

1413
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:06,720
uh

1414
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,280
i want to ask about switching costs

1415
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,559
see the thing is at the moment we're

1416
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,680
talking about competition policy and

1417
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,240
company a can fairly compete with

1418
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,599
company b

1419
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,920
i don't care about the companies

1420
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,119
i care about alice and bob

1421
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,520
and alice in one world garden can talk

1422
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,559
to bob

1423
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,839
in another walk garden is an improvement

1424
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,079
but the real thing for me is

1425
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,480
alice who is in one world garden

1426
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,200
can get up anytime she chooses and move

1427
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,599
to another wall garden of a choice

1428
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,839
without losing all her friends losing

1429
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,960
all the contacts losing etc so is there

1430
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,160
any sign of that sort of movement uh

1431
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,160
coming on to the agenda yet

1432
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,079
so i think that's the right the right

1433
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,599
question and i think that's one of the

1434
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,240
areas where the dma is very specific now

1435
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,920
what they can get it is a different

1436
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,880
story

1437
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,920
but i mentioned the example of of uh i

1438
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,240
have my amazon account and and suppose

1439
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,119
there's another platform that has

1440
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,839
amazon is obliged to provide the third

1441
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,799
party

1442
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,640
all of the search information that he

1443
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,559
used of me all the information they have

1444
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,400
about me that would allow the third

1445
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,079
party to provide exactly the same

1446
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,440
quality of service in terms of

1447
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,200
recommender systems

1448
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,040
that's the law

1449
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,480
again the devil's in the details i mean

1450
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,160
i i can think of a hundred ways that

1451
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,480
amazon could could could uh you know

1452
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,720
screw things up for the third party

1453
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,720
and that's where i believe

1454
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,319
technical support is going to be so so

1455
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,920
important you know lawyers are not going

1456
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,520
to be able to do this

1457
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,799
or economists for that matter

1458
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,760
alyssa cooper thank you for this talk

1459
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,200
it's very helpful

1460
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,280
um i have two questions my first

1461
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,040
question is

1462
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,920
about interoperability so there's

1463
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,599
obviously like many different ways that

1464
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,440
you can achieve interoperability and

1465
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,480
standards are just one of those um

1466
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
and so i'm curious whether

1467
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,000
there's a sense um that that you have

1468
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,559
from your perspective

1469
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,079
about whether the european commission

1470
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,920
has preferences about how this

1471
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,160
interoperability is achieved obviously

1472
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,040
in this venue we like standards a lot

1473
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,799
um and we like to do things on an

1474
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,599
internet scale um so a sort of

1475
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,599
one-to-one dialogue you know with each

1476
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,359
gatekeeper where they negotiate

1477
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:28,799
bilaterally how they're going to achieve

1478
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,440
this interoperability is sub-optimal

1479
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,119
from our perspective

1480
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,480
and you list it out i mean there's a

1481
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,720
number of areas where interoperability

1482
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,799
appears to be a goal it's very explicit

1483
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,160
with respect to messaging voice and

1484
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,760
video but there's lots of other ones in

1485
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,440
there around the data sharing and the

1486
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,680
ads ecosystem and search and all of that

1487
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,319
um so i'm just curious if uh if you if

1488
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,160
you can glean whether they actually

1489
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,599
would prefer to see standardized

1490
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,960
solutions to some of these things or

1491
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,880
whether they're kind of indifferent

1492
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,359
um and then the sort of flip side of

1493
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,480
that second question is there's

1494
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,119
my understanding of other pieces of um

1495
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,720
european union legislation where they're

1496
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,079
much more explicit about the

1497
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,680
standardization requirements where they

1498
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,079
actually you know detail them and then

1499
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,480
um and then you know delegate them to

1500
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,040
the european um standards organizations

1501
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,760
or for like in the the data act where

1502
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,240
they talk in cloud switching about um

1503
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,799
the need for standards or interfaces and

1504
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,640
it's much more explicit at least in my

1505
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,799
reading than it is in the dma and so i'm

1506
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,400
wondering if that's meaningful like the

1507
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
fact that there is no explicit language

1508
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,920
in there about standardization whether

1509
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,599
we should read something into that as

1510
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,079
far as um you know whether it was put to

1511
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,280
the side

1512
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,359
because it was not viewed as a viable

1513
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,599
option or if that was just part of the

1514
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,240
political process right uh two very good

1515
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,160
questions i mean i'm probably going to

1516
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
repeat myself a little bit in here but

1517
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,680
the dma

1518
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,040
was

1519
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
created by a bunch of politicians

1520
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,599
lawyers and economists who know nothing

1521
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,920
about technical details it was largely

1522
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,680
an exercise in reverse engineering

1523
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,200
saying here are some problems that we

1524
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,280
have we have to deal with apple we have

1525
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,119
to deal with google we have

1526
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,119
what is a law that would

1527
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,760
kind of relate to that and so um the

1528
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,880
answer to your question i don't think

1529
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,319
there are any preferences because they

1530
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,240
have no idea

1531
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,200
pardon

1532
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,319
my

1533
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,720
sincerity now you're on the record i

1534
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,200
have no idea how to do it and honestly i

1535
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,720
i i

1536
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,599
i really think that this is an era where

1537
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,680
you could make an enormous contribution

1538
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,520
because uh um

1539
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,920
it's the dma it's a that's a part i

1540
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,520
don't like it's a bit of a patchwork of

1541
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,000
things which is clearly guided by the

1542
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,559
problems that people have not by a

1543
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,559
general theory of how it could be but

1544
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,480
ultimately is as one of the previous

1545
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,240
questions said i think the goal is to

1546
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,480
end with closed systems

1547
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,359
the internet right now is a series of

1548
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,280
enclosed gardens

1549
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,760
enclosed systems that do not allow for

1550
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,960
competition

1551
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,480
app stores

1552
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,799
search protocol and so forth and so the

1553
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,280
idea is to to the best that we can try

1554
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,839
to end that

1555
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,280
um what's the best technical way of

1556
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,040
doing that i don't know and i think

1557
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
honestly i think that the european

1558
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,359
commission would be delighted

1559
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,280
to have ietf or

1560
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,400
uh iab contributions in that direction

1561
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,240
and but i also think that probably

1562
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,599
depends on

1563
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,119
what type of problem you're talking

1564
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,880
about because you know an app store is

1565
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,480
very different from search which is very

1566
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,720
different from uh algorithm

1567
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,520
uh

1568
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,040
i mean there are different types of

1569
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,880
problems on the commercial part of the

1570
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,040
internet i don't think there's one size

1571
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,599
fits all in terms of regulations

1572
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,720
thank you thank you

1573
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,839
we have christian next remotely and we

1574
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,599
are close to time so christian and

1575
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,760
mallory can you please keep it short and

1576
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,599
i'm cutting the queue after mallory

1577
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,839
thank you for the talk it was very

1578
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,200
interesting and it's interesting to see

1579
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,480
that people are trying to address

1580
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,400
competition issues

1581
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,440
i am a bit scared by

1582
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,440
what you have mentioned about sharing

1583
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,119
data

1584
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,880
i mean you mentioned competition as

1585
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,799
being a big issue in the internet and it

1586
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,160
is

1587
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,760
but there is another big issue which is

1588
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,520
surveillance

1589
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,920
which is the fact that companies

1590
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,880
are acquiring data about you

1591
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,079
to

1592
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,480
either sell products or

1593
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,440
even

1594
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,960
steer you towards particular goals

1595
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,760
behaviors and all that

1596
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,160
and when you say okay

1597
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,119
now everybody can negotiate with google

1598
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,480
or amazon

1599
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,400
and get all the clicks of their users

1600
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,359
that seems to me like a

1601
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,160
liberalization of surveillance

1602
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,799
in the old days only amazon and google

1603
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,839
and a couple of big guys could do that

1604
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,400
but in this brave new world

1605
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,480
anybody can get all the data all the

1606
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,760
time

1607
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,920
and that doesn't that seems scary

1608
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,280
um

1609
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,079
i

1610
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,960
my answer is i agree i i have to agree

1611
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,040
i think much of what you're talking

1612
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,520
about right now will probably fall under

1613
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,839
the digital services act which is the

1614
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,119
the next

1615
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,720
act as it were that the commission is

1616
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,720
putting which includes issues of

1617
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,040
surveillance issues of monitoring free

1618
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,839
speech issues of you know basically

1619
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,520
liability for users actions and and and

1620
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,359
responsibility for the user users

1621
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,760
privacy

1622
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,559
i

1623
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,079
don't know much about the digital

1624
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,640
services act um

1625
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,880
but as i said i i think your question

1626
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,960
probably refers more and more to that i

1627
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,799
mean regarding the example that i gave

1628
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,200
of of amazon search data

1629
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
you can think of that as

1630
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,880
in the old days of telecommunications

1631
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,559
number portability i mean there's kind

1632
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,319
of a similar idea i need to have a

1633
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,640
system whereby it's very easy for me if

1634
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,839
i want to go from a phone company to

1635
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,599
another company i can do it tomorrow at

1636
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,599
a very low cost

1637
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,880
it's the same thing when it comes you

1638
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,240
know if you switch a different browser

1639
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,599
you would like to have a way that all of

1640
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,440
your bookmarks could be transferred very

1641
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,720
easily

1642
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,559
that's the kind of thing that the dma is

1643
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,400
asking for in here is making it easier

1644
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,520
for the user to switch from one system

1645
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,039
to another system and to uh impose the

1646
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,400
obligation on the platform to provide

1647
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,480
that data so this is not a violation of

1648
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,319
privacy this is data that i know that

1649
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,480
amazon has about me and in fact i'm glad

1650
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,079
that amazon has about me because they

1651
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,160
make very good recommendations but i'm

1652
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,559
sick of amazon i want to move to

1653
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,839
um

1654
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,520
cabral platform

1655
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,599
and and i want amazon to give the cabral

1656
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,200
platform all of that data so that i can

1657
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,599
have a seamless transfer of of of

1658
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,440
services from one platform to the other

1659
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,280
so i don't think

1660
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,880
here it's so much

1661
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,480
i don't think it's an issue of privacy

1662
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,039
per se it's an issue of

1663
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,640
not allowing

1664
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,839
the firms to have

1665
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,279
proprietary rights over user level data

1666
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,079
hi everybody uh mallory nodal at the

1667
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,160
center for democracy and technology um

1668
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,319
thanks um professor cabral for coming on

1669
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,000
such short notice it's really good to

1670
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,440
have um this discussion here um about

1671
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,599
the impacts um i guess my question's

1672
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,599
really straightforward so it's short but

1673
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,000
you know we we've seen the global data

1674
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,400
protection regulation for example gdpr

1675
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,359
um kind of play out for a few years now

1676
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,440
and i think a lot of people would say

1677
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,599
there could be some changes we've got

1678
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,799
notes

1679
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,720
for those regulators and i wonder then

1680
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,760
about the dma as well i suspect that

1681
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,280
because we're already sort of

1682
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,119
anticipating problems that some of those

1683
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,960
problems will play out so what are the

1684
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,079
mechanisms to revise this how long will

1685
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,400
it take does it have to be in the courts

1686
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,559
would the ec be more flexible and

1687
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,720
actually changing this because i believe

1688
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,200
it's a directive not a regulation or

1689
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,680
maybe you could clarify on that and um

1690
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,520
you know what kinds of

1691
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,480
evidence or advocacy would be useful in

1692
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,799
bringing um you know really big red

1693
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,680
flags to uh the commission if it does

1694
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,520
happen to play out in ways that we think

1695
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,079
it might but actually then do correct i

1696
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,240
mean another great question uh yes

1697
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,079
you're quite right in fact the dma does

1698
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,839
have provisions for it to be revised in

1699
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,680
the next few years i mean my guess it'll

1700
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,000
take probably a decade before the dust

1701
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,960
settles on it um and and i mean any

1702
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,440
interested party can can can contribute

1703
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,319
to it uh so so uh uh i mean in that

1704
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,760
regards i mean i i think it's a good

1705
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,119
attitude that european commission have

1706
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,640
which is one of

1707
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,160
willingness to learn and willingness to

1708
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,400
adapt as time goes by

1709
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,760
i have to say that data point that you

1710
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,039
raise which i think is a very important

1711
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,359
point is

1712
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,640
i mean there are risks there are

1713
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,480
enormous risks the egdpr one risk was

1714
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,920
and there's some evidence already that

1715
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,440
economists have been studying that this

1716
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,599
had a very negative impact on small

1717
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,520
startups

1718
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,319
because you know if

1719
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,920
cookies i mean information about

1720
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,960
consumer data is what what made many of

1721
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,920
these startups survive and thrive and if

1722
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,839
all of a sudden you cannot do that it

1723
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,599
creates an enormous bear to want you for

1724
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,440
new startups so

1725
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,720
clearly there are risks i mean for

1726
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,319
example in the u.s i don't know if

1727
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,680
you're aware of that but one of the

1728
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,400
proposals uh senator warren and other

1729
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
people have been proposing is to have a

1730
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,760
complete

1731
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,119
moratorium or complete uh um

1732
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:30,000
prohibition of acquisitions of startups

1733
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,079
by large corporations like i said

1734
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,880
there's been about a thousand since 2000

1735
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,119
i think that would be disastrous if you

1736
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,039
ask me because it's an entire ecosystem

1737
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,680
that would disappear overnight

1738
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,760
so

1739
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,359
it's important to take into account the

1740
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,480
risks that such draconian policies have

1741
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,920
and i think that's one of the reasons

1742
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,799
why this is not set in stone i mean i

1743
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,880
was probably dramatizing it a little too

1744
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,599
much the document was approved last

1745
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,280
i think it was an important moment

1746
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,000
monday of last week but this is by no

1747
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,839
means the end of the story it will take

1748
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,760
probably a decade until things settle

1749
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,440
down and there will be a lot of dialogue

1750
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,119
with all the interested parties and a

1751
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,039
lot of adjustment in india various

1752
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,799
articles of the dma but it's a good

1753
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,480
start i think it's an important start

1754
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,680
all right thank you so much we're sorry

1755
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,359
for running a little bit over time can i

1756
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,039
ask everyone to join me in a round of

1757
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,670
applause for dr cabral

1760

great talk because i've been hearing

1761
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,880
about this so many times and now i feel

1762
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,559
like i understand a little bit more and

1763
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,720
i'm terrified

1764
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,680
um all right this is a wrap of the ib

1765
