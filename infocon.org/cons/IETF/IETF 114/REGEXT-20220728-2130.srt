hour today uh we do have a a couple of

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,520
uh discussion topics one which might be

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,960
a little bit lengthy

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
um but we'll just uh jump through our

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
details here so um

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
let's see

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
let's just move forward one

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,119
in the slides

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
this is the standard note well everyone

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
should be very well familiar with it by

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
now uh even if you're a newcomer you

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,479
surely have been to a meeting before

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,520
this one

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
so i won't really belabor this point

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,200
uh also just a reminder we now have a

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
whole set of code of conduct guidelines

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
um and a reminder you know treating each

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
other with respect and speaking slowly

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
and limit the use of slang

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,399
a couple of important things to uh put

44
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,280
up there

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
but also like to take this opportunity

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
to remind people

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
that uh everything is recorded here uh

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
make sure that you're aware of that and

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,318
keep that in mind when when you're

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,920
speaking

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,000
it to participate in the room you can

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
use the qr code which is not on the

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,959
screen anymore but i believe it's on the

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
back of a couple of chairs you surely

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,640
know all of that by now

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,360
and in any case you can go to the agenda

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
the

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
the

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
full agenda page and for each individual

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
meeting there is an icon over there on

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,239
the right on the line for choosing to

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
join the meeting room

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
you must join the meeting room

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,519
at least at the local tool to speak

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
please so that you can properly get

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
yourself in the queue put your hand up

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
and we'll call on people to come up to

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
the mic uh you'll see the cue list you

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
can you know one extra person can stand

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
up behind whoever's speaking just to

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
keep things moving along but we're going

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
to try not to crowd folks

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,400
as much as possible

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
and yes the important thing about

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
signing into the room is of course it's

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,080
the blue sheet

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,879
uh

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,239
reference and that's where all of that

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,599
comes from

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,360
so uh thanks for that

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,239
and

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
last point here is masks are required

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
unless you are speaking at the

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
microphone and strictly speaking i guess

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
i can wear mine

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
it's supposed to work just fine even at

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
these mics right

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
um people have had some issues at the

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
mics in the center of the room

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
so the reminder is to please make sure

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
to get very close to the microphone

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
please do eat the microphone and you

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
know speak in a normal or slightly above

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,519
voice

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
so that your sound can carry into the

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
room properly

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
all right thanks very much and i can see

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
that everyone in this room has a mask on

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
and we appreciate that

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
all right

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
here's our agenda for today it's a

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
pretty pro forma agenda

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
uh what we normally do so we'll just

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
kind of zip through some things here

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
pretty quickly

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
we've kind of already been into the

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,519
welcome

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
and introductions

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
and we've covered the note well

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
just a reminder in general that we very

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
much like

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
uh

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
we're trying very hard

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,600
to move forward with document management

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
and reviewers

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
you know we we have been trying to make

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
sure that although this is a

118
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
low volume group

119
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
and

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
not a very significant set of people

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,199
we're trying very hard to make sure we

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,080
have at least five independent people

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,759
who acknowledge that a document should

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,040
move forward

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
when we're looking for that doing during

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
last call and we're also trying to be in

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
a place where we get document shepherds

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
early in the process of a document if

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
not at the moment it's adopted

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
preferably

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
we've just had some issues with that

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
going along so

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
just trying to make sure we get all of

134
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
that along the way and appreciate your

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
help in that respect

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,960
finally uh we do need a minute taker

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
someone to take notes i know that

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,800
someone has graciously already put a

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
copy of the agenda there

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
so anyone who would be willing to

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
volunteer to um

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
step up and take some notes

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,800
okay so we just see rick here in the

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
front row so thank you very much to rick

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
wilhelm

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
you know our notes taking is not as

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
complex as some of the other groups you

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
know fairly straightforward just uh

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
collecting some bullet point summaries

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
and and actions of course

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
alongside the agenda that's already in

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
there so appreciate that rick thanks

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
much

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
okay

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,880
so let's move to a look at the documents

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,639
we've published since the last time

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
sadly none

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
um but i expect a banner year to be

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,479
coming up as we move along here we have

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
quite a few documents that are very

161
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
close to the end

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
and uh we also have

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,360
moving along here we have a document in

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,160
particular one that is currently with

165
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
the iesg

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
we have our internationalized email

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
addresses in epp

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,840
extension

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
there's been quite some discussion in

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
the ietf last call

171
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,759
i think this is probably our first

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
document that has really gotten this

173
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
much attention in the community at large

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
so that's much appreciated by the rest

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
of the ietf we've certainly had the

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
folks who are much more

177
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
expert in internationalization issues

178
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
who paid a lot of attention to this

179
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
i think it's in a pretty good place i'm

180
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
not going to walk through all of the

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
issues that have been discussed but

182
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
thank you to the document authors and

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,639
the document shepherd you know who've

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,160
been carefully tracking all of these

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
things and making sure that all the

186
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
details are covered

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
um and i believe the document is getting

188
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,440
very close to being released from the

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
iesg

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
um that all the issues have been i think

191
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,639
all the issues have actually been

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
acknowledged at this point and taken

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,599
care of

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
so i expect the isg will do its final

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
due diligence and that'll move along

196
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
into the rfc editor queue so that's a

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
good thing

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,120
no material issues that had to be handed

199
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,840
back to us to address so yay for us

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
okay and with that we're going to move

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
to walking through a few of our other

202
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
documents and status of existing work

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,599
and i'm going to turn this back over to

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
antoine who's going to walk us through

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
the rest of this

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
antoine if you want to just take over

207
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,719
the slides there

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,440
you have to

209
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
you have to do that for me right ah

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
you just removed them okay i'll open

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,039
them again no problem

212
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,719
so

213
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
here they are again and i think this is

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,120
where we

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
were going right

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,919
and you can all hear me

217
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
so this one you already did

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
okay existing work

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
no presentations well the first one of

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,199
course is a simple registration

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
reporting it's still in our queue

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,879
um

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,240
so i think

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
the chair rule but jim do you want do

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
you have anything to say about

226
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
your document

227
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
no thanks to uh jim gould who provided

228
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
some detailed comments we've provided a

229
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,919
revised document and uh we're

230
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
just

231
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,440
frankly kind of holding back at the

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
moment because there are other documents

233
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,880
that are kind of in front of it

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
rather than pressing on getting it

235
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
published

236
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,760
but

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
no new significant updates at the moment

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,399
and we expect that we'll move that along

239
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
as soon as something else moves up into

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
the queue first

241
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
thanks

242
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,640
okay great

243
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,839
then we have existing work with

244
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,760
discussions and documents and we have a

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
document registration there's a

246
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
dictionary header is going to talk about

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
that so header i will

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
take up your slides

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
do you want to have the control yourself

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,839
or do you want me to progress the slides

251
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
uh there's only there's only two two

252
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
substantive slides so we might as well

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
just keep on keep holding on

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
all right next slide please

255
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
all right um so

256
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
we've been

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
slowly updating this draft and the the

258
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
main feedback we've received um there's

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
sort of two two camps here

260
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
one is there's um some folks that have

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
an ongoing concern that the

262
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
draft will drive policy which is which

263
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
is not what um it's intended to do but

264
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
there is a concern that it will just by

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
its existence

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
that said there is support from for

267
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,480
example the rir space uh folks i talked

268
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
to on that side of the world said you

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
know they saw some potential overlap

270
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
um with some existing work

271
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,760
but uh there was value here that they

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
could see having a data dictionary of

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,279
common terms would be would be helpful

274
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
so

275
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,079
what we

276
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,519
were thinking is you know with this

277
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
draft this is

278
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,560
you know if you're going to do something

279
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,839
if you're going to be using terms and

280
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
the ietf is where you take that to

281
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
say here's how you do it but we're

282
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
really not trying to set the policy here

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,760
so

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,079
i'm looking for feedback as to is there

285
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,040
any

286
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
language that we can add

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,480
that would relieve some of that concern

288
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
i'm proposing to add some additional

289
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
text to the introduction and abstract

290
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
being very explicit that this is not

291
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
intended to promote policy development

292
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,959
it is uh intended to be broadly

293
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,880
applicable this is not just for of

294
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
course the i can't contracted parties

295
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
it's supposed to be for rir or cctlds

296
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
really anyone working in registration

297
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,920
space

298
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
um

299
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
there are a couple areas in the document

300
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,200
that if you could go to the next slide

301
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
please

302
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,200
that still needs some definition and

303
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
that's really the next thrust of work

304
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,880
that we'll be doing between now and the

305
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
next ietf meeting

306
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
if you have

307
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
thoughts feedback uh commentary both on

308
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
the question of how to relieve the

309
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,839
policy concern and

310
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
definitions to put for these tbd items

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
i'd love to hear your feedback

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
steve is there anything you would like

313
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
to add

314
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,279
there was something that was occurring

315
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,200
to me and then it went away and i'm

316
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
hoping it comes back momentarily so

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
um let's see if we get anybody else to

318
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,839
engage while i recover the thought that

319
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,120
i was going to share

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,959
okay we have a question from

321
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,399
richard richard go ahead please

322
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
uh sure thanks um

323
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
pir um

324
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
so

325
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
i'm i'm one of the folks although i

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
haven't put this on the list that this

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,680
this document really is

328
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
not helpful for um icann contracted

329
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,519
parties whether they be registrars or

330
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,800
registries

331
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
because the terms that it define

332
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
overlap strongly with terms that are

333
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,240
defined in in registrars and registries

334
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,519
contracts

335
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,639
and

336
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,839
frequently

337
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,360
icann refers to rfcs as a way to

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
anchor things in the technical realm

339
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,279
and the concern that this is going to be

340
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
that kind of a document is going to be

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
hard to get away from

342
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
especially when it defines things that

343
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
are

344
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,079
that are not necessarily as technical

345
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,240
and it's a data dictionary so i don't

346
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
know what really to do about that um

347
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
other than to

348
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,639
maybe limit the scope of the things that

349
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,920
are defined

350
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
um also there's overlap with other

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
documents but i think that's that's

352
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
one's already been been brought up

353
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
uh thank you

354
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
can i um

355
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
can i offer two comments

356
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
um

357
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
as as

358
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
uh as you noted uh icann

359
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
frequently refers to

360
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,440
rfcs as a source uh to draw from in

361
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
their definitions this is intended to be

362
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
exactly in that line

363
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
um

364
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,959
it's

365
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
the the awkwardness that i think you're

366
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,199
implicitly talking about is that

367
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,760
these definitions had not existed in rfc

368
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,519
form before

369
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,040
i can

370
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,800
start putting these into contracts

371
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
ideally

372
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,160
the

373
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
all the terms would be

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
all the terms that i can is interested

375
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,480
in

376
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
would be aligned and uh in any case

377
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
as is always the case for ietf documents

378
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
that there's no force behind them

379
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
they're adopted or used or referenced

380
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
as people find they find them useful to

381
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,240
do that

382
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
so a very sharp

383
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
division

384
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
between trying to have a neutral

385
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
external uh generally useful set of

386
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
definitions and then how

387
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
any group whether it's icann or any

388
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,320
other

389
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
group that implements things makes use

390
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
of those

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,680
so that's one comment that i wanted to

392
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
offer up and i uh it's genuinely not

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
intended

394
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,000
at all to be driving icann policy

395
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
it's intended to actually provide a

396
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
if you look at it from an icam

397
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,399
perspective a more solid basis for the

398
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
references for the terms that they use

399
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,279
separate point

400
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
we've envisioned

401
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
and expect that uh when this dictionary

402
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
is put together

403
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,160
that it's accompanied by a suitable set

404
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,839
of experts

405
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
that um

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
then are are

407
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
the um

408
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
i don't want to make it sound like

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
control but are the are the

410
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
um

411
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
source of

412
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,360
of of expertise expertise and sanity

413
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
with respect to

414
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
new terms that get added or raising

415
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
questions about whether there's conflict

416
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,600
between

417
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
you know two different terms that mean

418
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,639
the same thing and such

419
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,600
so

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
um

421
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
you know heather and i

422
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
are neither of us are volunteering to be

423
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,440
part of that expert group but one of the

424
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
things that has to be done downstream at

425
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
some point

426
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
wherever it's appropriate in the process

427
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
is to find volunteers

428
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
from the community who are willing to be

429
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,359
part of that

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
okay thank you steve and

431
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
richard you have another comment to make

432
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,800
uh yes please

433
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
yeah go ahead um so so thanks for that

434
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
steve i appreciate the the feedback

435
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
thing comment um it's precisely the

436
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
variability of that of the dictionary

437
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
and the fact that it's

438
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
going to be starting to be leaned on by

439
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
contracts that makes it

440
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
unsuitable because

441
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,720
the contracted parties can't have

442
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
the definition of what a registration is

443
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
be open for interpretation by an expert

444
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,040
group

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
the the contracts need firm language

446
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
upon which to be

447
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,000
built

448
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
and having

449
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,799
the these kind of definitions that are

450
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
contractually important

451
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,160
be rested in an rfc that's open to

452
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
malleability by an expert group no

453
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
matter how expert they are

454
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
is not the kind of contractual certainty

455
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
that contracted parties can live with

456
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
and so

457
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
while i understand that it's that it may

458
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
be interesting and useful for a

459
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,960
population

460
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
of certain

461
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
groups a key constituency in this whole

462
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
thing are the icann contracted parties

463
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
and this makes

464
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,559
their lives

465
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
their contractual lives

466
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
much more difficult than the benefit

467
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,919
that it gives

468
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,000
i would offer thank you

469
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
yeah i i think you're putting way too

470
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
much emphasis on

471
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,840
uh the role that this dictionary would

472
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
play um

473
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,919
i mean to take simple examples

474
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
where it says name

475
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
um

476
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
there's i don't know what what the

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
contractual issues uh and certain

478
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,200
definitions that you have in mind in the

479
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
icann contracts

480
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
that would have any issue about what a

481
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,760
name means

482
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
but

483
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,639
you know i think we're going

484
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,840
sort of imagining more force than is

485
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,039
intended there

486
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
um

487
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,320
also the icann

488
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
contracts although

489
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
uh they cover

490
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
half of the world uh of the domain name

491
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
system they don't cover the other half

492
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,679
and they don't cover the numbers

493
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
community

494
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
and so if one wants to think in terms of

495
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,919
whether or not

496
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
the fields that are defined might be

497
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
common across the entire spectrum then

498
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
the question is how do you get there

499
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
the itf is the place ican doesn't do

500
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that

501
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
or in other words steve i think you know

502
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
when it looks like a car when it smells

503
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
like a car

504
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,039
when it sounds like a car it's probably

505
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
a car right

506
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
yes but i didn't quite understand which

507
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
word you were using it looks like smells

508
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
like what

509
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
a car

510
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
a guard or domain name an automobile or

511
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
whatever

512
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
yeah

513
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,400
all right okay

514
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
one more point not in just to kind of

515
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,000
this is

516
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
serious business our talk about cars and

517
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
ducks notwithstanding just to bring the

518
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
point home

519
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
the contracted parties when we're

520
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,320
working with rfcs we are very careful

521
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,440
about which urls we use

522
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
so as the urls that go into the

523
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,120
contracts are the actual firm urls that

524
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
the urls can't be variable in later

525
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
spots that we nail down the actual

526
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
reference urls with the text that they

527
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
can't later refer to something else so

528
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
the contracted parties contracts are

529
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
serious business they incorporate and

530
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
reference rfcs for very important things

531
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,240
because the ietf makes important

532
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,159
contributions to those things

533
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
their firmness

534
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
and their quality is important and when

535
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
we've got something like this it's a

536
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,559
data dictionary that could be

537
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,720
moving underneath

538
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
that could be incorporated in the future

539
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
it sets a bad situation up for the icann

540
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
contracted parties precisely because the

541
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
itf

542
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,039
rfcs have such standing so it's not to

543
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
denigrate the rfcs it's direct i'm

544
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
pointing out the fact that they carry a

545
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
lot of weight in the icann community

546
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
thank you

547
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
yeah yeah but the the the point is

548
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
exactly to nail these down and put them

549
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
in a um

550
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,039
a solid position we're talking about an

551
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,799
iana managed

552
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
registry that is intended to be to have

553
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,679
exactly this solidity that you're

554
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
talking about and not be

555
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,480
mangled or changed arbitrarily over time

556
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
it's the same as any other protocol

557
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
definitions you need them to be quite

558
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
stable

559
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
can i

560
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
george michaelson apnea can i talk

561
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,240
briefly to this

562
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
i i actually have a great deal of

563
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,760
sympathy to the problem a contracted

564
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
party would have in this space and i

565
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
don't think your response from pir is

566
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
silly in any sense at all i think this

567
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
is a rational response

568
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
but i wanted to observe the nature of an

569
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
rfc is the post publication they are

570
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
substantively immutable

571
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,159
and were there subsequent change to a

572
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,600
data dictionary we might call it a

573
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,720
9999 biz

574
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,440
process in draft but when it's published

575
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,760
the number it gets will not be 99.99

576
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
it can't be the nature of the document

577
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,640
is that it becomes an immutable state of

578
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
the data dictionary at the time it is

579
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,919
published but your substantive point

580
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
about the

581
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,600
contractual and legal issues i think

582
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
that's a genuine concern i think you're

583
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
right to wear it but i don't think the

584
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,200
mutability of the dd is material because

585
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
if you embedded a url ref it would embed

586
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
to the historically consistent state

587
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
that was my only point

588
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
thank you george very well stated and it

589
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
reminds me of

590
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
since i invented the rfcs 50 years ago

591
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,799
uh as genuinely requests for comments

592
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,440
i've observed that we passed the 1984

593
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,600
mark of george orwell

594
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,640
and that

595
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
the words don't mean anything like what

596
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,720
they used to mean requests comments are

597
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
no longer requested

598
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
by the time an rfc is published

599
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
okay thank you steve and um

600
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
i want to say the record well my remark

601
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,080
was not so more about that perhaps uh

602
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,600
steve you might be able to explain what

603
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
the um

604
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
the experts

605
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,280
are supposed to do are they going to

606
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
change any of the definitions that are

607
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
in the data dictionary or do you

608
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
envision that they are you know

609
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,159
reviewing

610
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
new additions for new terms that need to

611
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,120
go into the data dictionary

612
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,159
well the the the essential role is on

613
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
the latter uh as

614
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,120
gatekeepers and

615
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,400
you know curators and and

616
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,600
managers of sanity for new entries

617
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
and to and to make sure things remain

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
stable not to go fiddling around

619
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,880
that that was also my my fault

620
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
and hence i thought you know when there

621
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
is a definition the definition remains

622
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
stable otherwise it's no sense to make a

623
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
definition right

624
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
precisely

625
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
exactly okay any other questions on this

626
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,760
document

627
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,720
if not then thank you heather

628
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
and thank you steve and

629
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,400
i will go to

630
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
the next slide

631
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,799
let's first a little bit

632
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,520
share slides again

633
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
thank you

634
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,320
okay so

635
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,559
that was extreme decision and then we

636
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,600
come

637
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
to

638
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
i think the major part of our discussion

639
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,279
here today

640
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,919
will be about the art up extensions uh

641
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,720
and identifier conformance um as most of

642
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
you seen there has been quite some

643
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
discussion on the mailing list recently

644
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
about this topic uh firstly i want to

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,919
follow i apologize for not entering the

646
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
discussion immediately uh

647
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,200
i had a pretty long vacation so i had to

648
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
read it all back and it was quite a lot

649
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
and i think many people have had the

650
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
same issues

651
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
um

652
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,320
the result of the discussion um was that

653
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,120
we have four rtf documents which are

654
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
being held back by the outcome of the

655
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
discussion

656
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
so jim and i thought it would be useful

657
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
to have a um

658
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,640
a summary of the discussion and try to

659
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
resolve it here

660
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
and discuss um

661
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
anything about the uh the extension

662
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,919
identifier and art up conformance and we

663
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,400
have a presentation for that and jim

664
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
will

665
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,159
jim has done a great job in some summary

666
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,840
so i will

667
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,919
give the word to jim ah you brought them

668
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
up already yourself so you can control

669
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,919
them so go ahead and try to explain the

670
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,120
discussions that we had

671
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,520
okay thanks very much uh antoine um

672
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
and yeah there has been quite some

673
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
discussion um on the

674
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,039
mailing list

675
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
about this work

676
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,039
uh and about the issue

677
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
so uh what we're gonna do here is i'm

678
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
gonna very briefly

679
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,720
uh just kind of look at a summary of the

680
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,039
discussion that happened i'm sure that

681
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,559
most of you have already looked at the

682
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
slides here so you know what the

683
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,919
punchline is

684
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,760
i think the most important thing to say

685
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,919
is that we're not really going to try to

686
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
review the technical merits of any one

687
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,320
of the proposals or another

688
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,919
so we're going to come at this from a

689
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
slightly different direction

690
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
look again

691
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
a bit at the problem that we think we're

692
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
trying to solve here

693
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,520
and we're going to put a proposal

694
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
forward

695
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
so this is just a a chairs proposal

696
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
for um

697
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
you know how to proceed and and where to

698
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,159
go from here and so we'd like to focus

699
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
the discussion on our proposal not on

700
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
the technical merits of one option or

701
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,200
another

702
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
and the path forward

703
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
so with that in mind uh this slide

704
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,760
really is i i owe thanks to uh jazip

705
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,960
zing

706
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
who actually produced a document a

707
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
multi-page document where he did quite

708
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
the technical analysis a summary of all

709
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,679
of the issues i want to thank him for

710
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
that i just kind of picked out a few

711
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
things here just to put it in for the

712
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
historical record so that we can all see

713
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
what's there

714
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
again i really don't want to dwell on on

715
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
the various technical merits of these

716
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
different things except to say that

717
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
frankly

718
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
there really isn't anything wrong with

719
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
any one of them you know if we were

720
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
starting from scratch i think that all

721
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
three of these are perfectly valid paths

722
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,039
forward and and we'd be having a

723
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
slightly different discussion

724
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,200
we'd want to dig in a little more on on

725
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
the technical merits of the differences

726
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,200
between these things so that we could

727
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,279
think more about what our future looks

728
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,039
like from today

729
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,440
as opposed to what was done

730
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
you know when epp was created and

731
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
looking forward and how it put things

732
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
out there so

733
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
our particular choice here and the

734
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,720
proposal that we're going to get to is

735
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
not intended to undermine any one of

736
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,279
these options i think they're they're

737
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,840
all uh good choices they all have their

738
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
advantages um

739
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
disadvantages but you know we're just

740
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
gonna we're gonna move on from that at

741
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,480
the moment

742
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,799
okay

743
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,320
you know and clearly the other thing to

744
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,039
keep in mind is that we're a relatively

745
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,960
small group

746
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
really those who are very active in

747
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,000
these discussions really are all experts

748
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
and so the opinions about

749
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
each of these individual options are

750
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,159
very solid and stable opinions you know

751
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,640
i mean these are people who who really

752
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
you know do command the respect that

753
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
they've earned in presenting these

754
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
options and talking about them

755
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,000
but as chairs the problem that we're

756
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
faced is we don't have consensus which

757
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,720
is kind of interesting in our group

758
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,799
consensus usually means just finding

759
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,880
three to five solid people who are not

760
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,360
an author of the document or or

761
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,240
otherwise engaged with its movement

762
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,159
um who agree or don't you know at least

763
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,840
explicitly don't have any objection to

764
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
it and we don't even have that it's

765
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,320
clear that we we've got you know

766
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,720
the people who we would normally turn to

767
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
to

768
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
help steer the group in a single

769
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,399
direction

770
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,200
are all on on different sides of this

771
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,279
so

772
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,880
on the one hand you know what we have

773
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,000
here is is a technical problem

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,240
but we have an internet standard that

775
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
has a defined solution for what we're

776
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
doing

777
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,039
we can certainly

778
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,279
you know have some discussion about how

779
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
clearly defined all of that was but what

780
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,159
the chairs are putting forward here is

781
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,559
given that we have an internet standard

782
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,039
we really do have to fall back on

783
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,760
on the process point of there's a pretty

784
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
high bar for changing what already

785
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:02,960
exists

786
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
there has to be by definition that's

787
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,840
what it means to be an internet standard

788
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,559
so

789
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,320
you know with respect to these options

790
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
we we you know got to thinking about

791
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
okay

792
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
well if that's the case then

793
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,279
you know what do these things look like

794
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,960
against the standard that's already

795
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
there

796
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
and we took a step back to ask ourselves

797
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
you know what problem are we really

798
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,919
trying to solve

799
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,159
i want to call out a couple of specific

800
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,000
sections which have appeared on the

801
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,279
mailing list

802
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
i believe

803
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,760
scott has

804
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
scott hollenbeck called out both of

805
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,279
these sections as part of the discussion

806
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,120
uh but in any case

807
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,600
you know in the rdap rfcs the first one

808
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,320
in the series in the extensions does in

809
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,799
talk about the fact that the rdap

810
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,679
identifier itself i'm sorry

811
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,480
the extension identifier for rdap in the

812
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,279
registry should be unique against all

813
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,880
other identifiers

814
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
and so that that becomes in our mind as

815
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
we we look at how to think about these

816
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,320
things the critical

817
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
characteristic that we're looking for

818
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
um in defining extensions in any

819
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,240
extension in in our dap

820
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
and another thing

821
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,720
is in 1983 which is the response

822
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,320
specification which talks about

823
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,279
responses look like it also explicitly

824
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,360
talks about what goes in the rdap

825
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
conformance is a unique string that's a

826
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,440
literal value

827
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,399
in the rdap extension registry

828
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,039
so all of these things you know keep us

829
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,399
to a first principle of uniqueness

830
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,039
whatever identifier is there you know

831
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,799
that is the principle by which we're

832
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,519
restarted that's where we were when we

833
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
started and you know that's really where

834
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
we should stay and so the question is

835
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
you know have we really motivated

836
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
wanting to change that particular

837
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
property

838
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,279
we're also sort of mixed on this issue

839
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
of head what's your metric for

840
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
evaluation of some of these changes a

841
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
lot of the discussion

842
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
we've noticed focuses on programming

843
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,480
as a metric for you know which which

844
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
option to choose some things you know

845
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
require more programming work than other

846
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,360
things

847
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
taking a step back

848
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,039
and and maybe this is just our point of

849
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,679
view but it's certainly i'll say for

850
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,159
myself it represents my experience over

851
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,960
time in the ietf you know programming is

852
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,519
not really the first order metric that's

853
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,039
not to say that complexity is not

854
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
important but what we really care about

855
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,960
is protocol behavior

856
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
and protocol performance

857
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
i mean to a large extent programming is

858
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,159
a one-off thing right once you figure

859
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,000
out what you want to do you put whatever

860
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
effort you have to into the programming

861
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,519
and then you move on

862
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,640
so

863
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,399
you know judging a particular option

864
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,480
based on the amount of effort

865
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,159
to get it right

866
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,880
uh doesn't feel like the right metric

867
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
you're really more concerned with how

868
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,600
it's all going to behave and how it

869
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
comes together

870
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,159
so in the end

871
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,720
what we think is you know have we

872
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
created a problem is there a problem out

873
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,840
there

874
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
that

875
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
um

876
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,320
does something different in terms of the

877
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,840
first principles of uniqueness and

878
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,600
optionality we think that extensions in

879
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
general have to have those two

880
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120
characteristics those are the things

881
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,039
which are most important

882
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,279
in this space and in deciding you know

883
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,279
whether or not to change into any one of

884
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,519
these options the question is is there a

885
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,279
problem that exists

886
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
that um

887
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,480
is beyond

888
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,279
what these two properties uh actually

889
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,720
provide

890
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,600
okay

891
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
so have we found a bar that we've

892
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,399
crossed in order to change the standard

893
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
because we believe the standard has

894
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
those two critical properties and these

895
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,120
options really don't

896
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
have those two properties in the same

897
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
way

898
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
all right

899
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,039
so what is our particular suggestion

900
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,720
here

901
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
focusing on the fact that we want to

902
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,559
keep the uniqueness and optionality and

903
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,320
we also think that simplicity is

904
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
preferred

905
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
then

906
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
the observation we make is these

907
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,640
discussions about the options are about

908
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,679
finding some way to version extensions

909
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,000
and supporting a versioning

910
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
option of some sort in the extensions

911
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
and it is our belief here and our

912
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,599
assertion that support for versioning is

913
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,199
not an integral part of the base

914
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,440
standard it's not part of our dap as

915
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
defined

916
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,159
and while it might be interesting to

917
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,560
solve that problem as part of

918
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
you know our working group here we

919
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,119
honestly have not heard we don't believe

920
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,879
any of the options

921
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,359
have motivated the need for changing

922
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
that particular characteristic

923
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
focusing on uniqueness and optionality

924
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
versioning is not part of those two

925
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
things it's a different thing entirely

926
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,839
and that wasn't covered in the base back

927
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,918
it's just not present and not intended

928
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,679
to be there

929
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,239
now we do observe that certainly

930
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,839
you could choose to provide optioning

931
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
inside of your extension definition if

932
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,960
you're so inclined

933
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,440
arguably option three in that list is

934
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,680
kind of like that option three is

935
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,760
essentially describing a mechanism

936
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,480
whereby an extension itself could decide

937
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
in its own specification

938
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,960
to provide a means for versioning

939
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,800
that would be fine you know i mean

940
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
that's an independent object it can do

941
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
what it wants to do and you can see if

942
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
it gets tractioning

943
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,599
but it doesn't feel like something that

944
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,359
should rise to the level of being

945
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
handled by the extension registry

946
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,680
and it doesn't rise to the level of

947
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
something that should be handled by the

948
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
rdap protocol itself

949
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
at that level

950
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,079
and so that's the observation that we

951
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,040
make

952
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
um

953
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480
and

954
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,880
you know that really is the point so

955
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,040
i think that you know

956
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,119
what we're proposing is probably closest

957
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,880
to option one

958
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,960
um but in principle you know we just

959
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
want to focus on the fact that uh none

960
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
of these options really

961
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
um

962
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,440
you know they haven't made they haven't

963
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,359
motivated a change to a full internet

964
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,400
standard

965
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
and so we believe that versioning is not

966
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
something that's covered and we should

967
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
not open that door and open that topic

968
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
in this in this uh

969
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,400
working group at this time

970
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,320
that uh trying to challenge the base

971
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,480
specification doesn't we haven't got

972
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,119
consensus to do that not at all

973
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
there's been no uh technical motivation

974
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,359
for for doing that

975
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,359
so that is our

976
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,750
uh response to all of that discussion um

977
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,000
[Music]

978
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,599
not sure how that's gonna going to sit

979
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,440
with people give people a chance to

980
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,200
think about that a bit more

981
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
um i've added a little bit of color oh

982
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
we do have someone in the queue here so

983
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
let's uh take that question so jim gould

984
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,480
go ahead

985
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,599
can you hear me

986
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,040
yes we can

987
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,520
okay good thank you well first off i i

988
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,599
wanted to say i i appreciate the

989
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,480
passionate debate on the list it's uh i

990
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
really enjoyed it um

991
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,520
and i want to appreciate the uh the work

992
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,760
that the chairs did in uh coming up with

993
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
this

994
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,280
proposal i know it's difficult um and i

995
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,359
can get behind it um

996
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,920
i do have a couple caveats that i want

997
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
to point out that i i really believe

998
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,520
that version is an important element

999
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,760
that we should look to add in the future

1000
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,079
in some way so that may be something for

1001
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,280
us to

1002
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,839
uh look for the opportunity to do so

1003
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,720
uh the other is that uh we do need to

1004
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,960
support versioning of

1005
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,640
uh policy identifiers uh for example the

1006
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,560
pro the the rdap profile identifiers

1007
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,359
um

1008
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,599
version and those scenarios are

1009
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,240
important there are not extensions

1010
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,760
with actual elements of of an extension

1011
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,880
so

1012
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,119
i want to ensure that that version

1013
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,520
can continue to be supported in the

1014
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,119
extension register

1015
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,200
so that's it thank you very much

1016
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,599
so thank you jim appreciate the comment

1017
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,560
um

1018
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
under the the second bullet here even on

1019
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,880
this slide uh the second bullet under

1020
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
the second bullet

1021
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
where you make the observation that you

1022
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,920
know there probably is an opportunity

1023
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,760
for additional clarity regarding

1024
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,880
versioning

1025
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,079
um

1026
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
i put it there on the slide when antoine

1027
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
and i were talking and left it as kind

1028
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
of a question mark because

1029
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
whereas the change of the lunar neck

1030
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,359
level zero to just lunarnic really isn't

1031
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,880
a rada change and that's a fairly

1032
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,119
straightforward and easy thing to do

1033
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,400
it's not clear that this is a

1034
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,720
straightforward and easy thing to do so

1035
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,240
jim you just brought up the issue that

1036
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
versioning is something that we should

1037
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,520
approach

1038
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,839
and and you know pay more attention to

1039
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,000
and bring it as a topic forward and

1040
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,320
certainly don't object to that i agree

1041
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,760
it's it's a

1042
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,720
very

1043
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
it's certainly a technical topic within

1044
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,880
the context and within scope for this

1045
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,000
working group

1046
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
so uh you know there's an opportunity

1047
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,520
there if someone wants to press on that

1048
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,960
and have that discussion

1049
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
and it is related to this question you

1050
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,839
know should we have some additional

1051
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
clarity regarding versioning

1052
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,119
um

1053
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
i don't know i i was

1054
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,480
we were looking

1055
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,160
anton and i trying to decide if there

1056
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,079
was an editorial point somewhere along

1057
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,160
the way where we could add some changes

1058
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,480
that might make this a little more clear

1059
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,119
but it just started getting really kind

1060
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,839
of

1061
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,960
uncertain

1062
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,119
i felt like we were crossing a line

1063
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,520
between editorial and material and

1064
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
figured it was really a question to

1065
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
bring back to the group here

1066
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,240
i mean if there's interest i think i'd

1067
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,640
i'd like to see us do that

1068
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
as a working group but i don't want to

1069
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,079
we don't want to force the issue

1070
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,079
and i don't know i'm going to put you on

1071
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,440
the spot there scott if you have any

1072
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
thoughts about that offhand or if you

1073
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,560
don't want to say anything that's fine

1074
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,640
oh you just put your hand up so

1075
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
go ahead go for it

1076
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
sure thank you jim scott holland back

1077
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,599
here uh first i'd like to say uh i do

1078
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,440
support this proposal

1079
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
um i

1080
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,720
it's it's actually something a

1081
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
suggestion i made on the list several

1082
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,760
weeks ago

1083
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
uh basically be kevin i because i i

1084
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
agree with your assessment that

1085
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,000
there are some places in 1983 where the

1086
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,599
wording is a little inconsistent you've

1087
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,119
got the one example there where there's

1088
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,520
one example that talks about the string

1089
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,480
lunar nick being used as an identifier

1090
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
another example uses lunar nic level

1091
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,680
zero

1092
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
uh those examples should be consistent

1093
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
and i'm actually going to suggest a

1094
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,839
slight change to this proposal and that

1095
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,079
we should change lunar nick to luna nick

1096
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,440
level zero

1097
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,079
because rdap is itself is identified

1098
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,560
with the identifier rdap level zero

1099
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
i

1100
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,599
but it's uh just for the sake of

1101
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,200
consistency right i think they should be

1102
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
the same

1103
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
um and there's also one other place in

1104
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,640
1983 where it talks about these

1105
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,119
identifiers as uh those that are

1106
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,280
returned in the rdap conformance data

1107
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,480
structure

1108
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,200
uh as being a hint

1109
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,040
i think that word hint

1110
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,280
is a little bit soft and potentially

1111
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,560
leads

1112
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,400
to questions of interpretation and

1113
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,520
confusion

1114
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,960
and so uh i've got a sentence in mind

1115
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,160
that i'm thinking about that i'll

1116
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,000
probably throw out to the list

1117
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,800
or you know in the creation of an erotum

1118
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
report for this so we will have

1119
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,119
something to discuss on list in terms of

1120
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
the way the erotic is processed and so

1121
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,319
for people yeah if you're wondering well

1122
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,960
how is that processed someone actually

1123
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
you know goes to the rfc editor webpage

1124
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,119
and fills out a little report saying hey

1125
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,359
i think i have found a technical issue

1126
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,960
with this rfc

1127
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,520
right they describe it in detail

1128
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
and then that

1129
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
report is sent among other places to the

1130
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,920
working group mailing list

1131
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,119
where

1132
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,400
the suggestion for the correction um

1133
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,079
you know and the merits of that can be

1134
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,280
discussed

1135
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,839
so you know this isn't just a slam dunk

1136
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,440
you know one person says something and

1137
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,200
then the rfc editor is noting a change

1138
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,480
someplace we will still have an

1139
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,800
opportunity for discussion

1140
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
um and as i said i think uh you know

1141
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,400
changing that word hint to something a

1142
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
little bit stronger and less open to

1143
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,280
interpretation is one other place where

1144
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,119
we should probably look at 1983.

1145
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
so thank you for that uh let me first

1146
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,359
say that um i certainly take your

1147
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,280
friendly amendment of reversing my

1148
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,760
suggested errata thing here that's fine

1149
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
you know i i think that um it is

1150
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,920
important to make the uh examples

1151
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
consistent

1152
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,480
um

1153
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,720
and your suggestion about uh

1154
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,599
the hint mechanism um well i see antoine

1155
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,880
came in the queue here there's a

1156
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
discussion that he and i were having as

1157
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,480
we got into all of this about rdap

1158
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,079
conformance i'm sure he's going to ask

1159
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,440
that question so why don't you go ahead

1160
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
and do that

1161
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,880
i actually want to do to have a

1162
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
different question and the question is

1163
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
actually directed to james because you

1164
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,359
know

1165
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,520
what we what we're trying to do here is

1166
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,640
that the

1167
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,720
or what we said about the versioning is

1168
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
that the extensions at the moment don't

1169
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,160
have a

1170
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
method for versioning

1171
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,119
um

1172
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,280
but the comment that james made what it

1173
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,880
was and they made it again now in the

1174
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,560
chat room is that you want to ensure

1175
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,920
that the version of the policy

1176
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,359
identifiers

1177
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,839
uh that they have versioning and i think

1178
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,880
there's no question about that right

1179
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,240
so

1180
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,079
you thought jim that we wanted to have a

1181
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,520
discussion about versioning of

1182
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
extensions

1183
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,160
but um i think the the versioning of

1184
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,040
policy identifiers is with without any

1185
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,079
uh

1186
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,079
discussion right

1187
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,280
and i see scott first in the queue so

1188
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,079
scott go ahead

1189
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,079
uh thanks antoine scott holland beck um

1190
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,880
in the ca yes i should also note i do

1191
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,119
support the idea of having a discussion

1192
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,920
around versioning version negotiation

1193
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,200
right

1194
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,960
and i will note that there actually is

1195
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,520
text right now in 1983 if you look at

1196
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
the description of the help response

1197
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,000
it does say that among the other

1198
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,760
information that can be returned is

1199
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,560
information describing extensions

1200
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,400
now unfortunately that's as far as it

1201
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,440
goes

1202
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,319
which

1203
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,000
means there's an awful lot of room there

1204
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
to interpret well what exactly does

1205
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,560
extension identification look like

1206
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,960
but i think that that does mean we have

1207
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,240
i don't know if i'd want to call it a

1208
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,640
foundation but at least we have a rough

1209
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,960
idea of where we might look uh for a

1210
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,280
possible method and a mechanism

1211
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,359
to add these kinds of capabilities to

1212
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,480
our dap

1213
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,160
so before you before you sit down and

1214
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
step away um the question that i thought

1215
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
antoine was going to ask is he and i got

1216
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
into this discussion about why does rdap

1217
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,400
conformance even exist

1218
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,160
because it doesn't seem to have there's

1219
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,960
no

1220
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,640
there's no material processing

1221
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
requirement on the part of a response or

1222
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,760
a client

1223
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
and so it the only real purpose that it

1224
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
had as far as we could tell was about

1225
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
the help

1226
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,240
because in in principle the suggestion

1227
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,640
is that all of the extension identifiers

1228
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
in use or supported would be listed

1229
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
there so that's its only real existence

1230
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
but it's interesting that

1231
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,480
all the examples say that rdap

1232
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,800
conformance must exist right but there's

1233
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
nothing that says what you're supposed

1234
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,160
to do with whatever's in there and then

1235
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,520
as you just said you've got the hint

1236
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,280
question right so it all just came to

1237
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
that larger question do you want to

1238
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,960
comment at all on that or yeah sure

1239
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,400
because 9083 does also say that you know

1240
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,560
in the context of returned values uh of

1241
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
an extension that a that for example a

1242
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
client might not recognize

1243
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,720
uh this is why extensions register and

1244
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,800
use these identifiers

1245
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,280
they are intended to tell a client that

1246
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,079
hey here is for example a data structure

1247
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,119
that does not exist in the core spec

1248
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,680
and you can match the prefix on this

1249
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,760
data structure to the identifiers that

1250
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,480
returned in the rdap conformance section

1251
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,640
to tell you where the specification for

1252
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,319
how to process that extension exists

1253
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,640
yep so yeah it's

1254
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
i don't yeah i'm maybe i'm not

1255
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,920
expressing myself well that's not

1256
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
getting to the question i'm asking

1257
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,480
as as i understand it even when the when

1258
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,319
the server provides the response it

1259
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,880
doesn't have to tell you what extensions

1260
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,839
that he used because that's an option

1261
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,359
and so

1262
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,839
and in fact a client can simply ignore

1263
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,000
objects it doesn't recognize right an

1264
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,079
extension that doesn't recognize

1265
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,880
so

1266
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,200
the presence of rdap conformance you

1267
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,040
know except for the help thing where i'm

1268
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
trying to find out what a server does it

1269
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
doesn't seem to serve any purpose any

1270
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,839
material purpose and as documented yeah

1271
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,359
i mean i think the intention of that

1272
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
rdac conformance data structure is that

1273
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,760
the server should return information

1274
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,079
describing all of the specifications

1275
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,720
that are represented in that response

1276
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,599
to include you know rdap level 0

1277
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,960
core rdap

1278
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,760
and

1279
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
any other extension that is represented

1280
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,040
in the response

1281
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,400
and i

1282
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,920
the intention is not that that is an

1283
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,599
optional thing

1284
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,359
right but now we're back to being a hint

1285
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,119
on the client side and all that but all

1286
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,920
that's fine okay um

1287
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,920
oh it exists so a client can know which

1288
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,520
career parameters to use when sending

1289
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,680
the requests well sure that makes sense

1290
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,800
to me uh andy in in the sense that a

1291
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,640
client would do a help request to find

1292
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,319
out what's available and then it could

1293
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,079
go do things then it would know what to

1294
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,760
do so i do understand the idea that the

1295
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,680
in the help response

1296
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,760
the the r adapter performance would list

1297
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,119
all the extensions

1298
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,359
it's just interesting that it's also

1299
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,160
there in all responses

1300
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,240
um and it's suggested that it can be

1301
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,720
there but it does not seem to have any

1302
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
material value in a response

1303
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
certainly speaking it's just a hint so

1304
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,319
to speak

1305
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,280
um

1306
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
that's just an observation i guess it's

1307
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,559
not really a complaint

1308
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,040
um okay jim gold you've been waiting

1309
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,559
quite patiently

1310
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,880
ahead

1311
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,119
can you hear me

1312
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,240
yep

1313
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,400
great thank you very much all right it's

1314
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,680
unusual for me to be patient so um

1315
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,839
yeah i just want to ensure that we uh

1316
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,839
don't disallow a version of the policy

1317
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,720
identifiers that's all um so

1318
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,440
as i understand it that version is not a

1319
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,400
feature

1320
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
of art app and that

1321
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,119
the registrations of extension and the

1322
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,119
structure of those extensions will not

1323
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,480
include version

1324
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,839
or don't have to

1325
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,720
uh but as long as we also

1326
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,400
are don't disallow

1327
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,559
the inclusion of a versioned policy

1328
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,440
identifier i think i'm fine

1329
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,760
thank you

1330
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,400
yeah i think that made sense to me and

1331
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,000
i'm okay with that but rick is jumping

1332
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,680
up to the queue sure i was although

1333
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,200
scott was first but

1334
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
now that you're there

1335
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
go ahead

1336
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,520
thanks rick scott holland back uh yeah

1337
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,760
jim i agree with you completely right i

1338
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,280
mean we already have registered

1339
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,720
identifiers in the iana registry uh for

1340
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,400
example the rdap profile that was

1341
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,960
developed by icann

1342
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,599
and there is nothing that that modifies

1343
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,680
in the context of changing data

1344
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,520
structures and response

1345
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,000
right it's all about

1346
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,520
what a server does in terms of

1347
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,480
constructing the response within the

1348
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,079
confines of standard 95 already

1349
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,160
right so it tells the client hey this is

1350
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,839
kind of what you can expect you know in

1351
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,119
terms of your response and how it's

1352
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,119
constructed um

1353
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,880
but as i said you know nothing was

1354
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,079
extended

1355
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,160
it's really a more more of a processing

1356
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,240
oriented thing and yes i want to make

1357
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,800
sure that we continue to allow that for

1358
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,480
very important reasons that this this is

1359
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,680
definitely needed from a policy

1360
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,160
perspective

1361
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,480
okay thanks scott

1362
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,680
okay so um

1363
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,520
i think the proposal here to um

1364
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,359
just you know stick with these things

1365
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,000
are unique identifiers

1366
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,119
and they match one to one between the

1367
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,359
rdap conformance

1368
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,640
element

1369
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,480
object and the

1370
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,600
rdap extension

1371
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,880
[Music]

1372
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
identifiers

1373
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,400
they're just opaque strings

1374
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,319
as far as the protocol is concerned then

1375
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,400
there's a one-to-one mapping there

1376
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,200
and it's always a unique specification

1377
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,680
that the extension identifier maps to

1378
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,520
and all of those extension identifiers

1379
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,000
need to be unique

1380
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,359
and so we're just going to kind of stick

1381
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,440
with that and that's we're going to go

1382
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,480
i

1383
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,680
accept

1384
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,520
so the proposal here about the errata

1385
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,599
that's you know that's fine wherever

1386
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,880
wherever you take that scott and that

1387
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,640
goes to the list and that'll get

1388
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,160
properly reviewed

1389
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,400
and so that's fine and george go ahead

1390
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
please so just george michaelson ap nick

1391
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,000
just so i understand the formalism

1392
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,240
we don't make decisions in rooms right

1393
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,839
so what you're saying is this is the

1394
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,000
chairs making a proposal it's going to

1395
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,400
the list you're seeking consensus on a

1396
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,720
chair proposal

1397
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,040
thank you george for uh reminding me

1398
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,559
that i should be a little more careful

1399
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,640
about that very good yes

1400
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,960
uh we certainly want to make sure in in

1401
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
the minutes that all this is captured

1402
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,960
and we should close out the discussion

1403
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,240
there are multiple threads on the

1404
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,720
mailing list um should try and pull all

1405
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,319
of them together with it with a closing

1406
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,280
message

1407
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,760
uh which points to this discussion and

1408
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,880
these slides and what we're gonna do

1409
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,280
so uh that's where we'll end up

1410
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,240
okay

1411
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,920
any other comments or questions about

1412
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,359
this

1413
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,880
not seeing anything else in the uh

1414
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
room here let me just take a quick look

1415
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,559
through the

1416
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,640
uh chat here at the end thank you andy

1417
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,880
that hint was bad language yes

1418
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,319
i think they're just a couple of

1419
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,680
interesting things it's amazing what

1420
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,119
turns up as one goes through this

1421
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
process over the years

1422
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,280
and thank you for uh supporting the

1423
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,960
proposal

1424
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,640
um okay

1425
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,119
so we are all good i think with that um

1426
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,880
antoine i'll just turn this back to you

1427
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,079
here

1428
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,160
yes i'm trying to preload the slides but

1429
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,520
i think you uh

1430
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,119
you first need to drop yours yeah right

1431
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,359
share

1432
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,359
because i think

1433
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,839
that was

1434
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,520
the last

1435
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,960
piece of our agenda or at least we have

1436
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,280
eight minutes left for any other

1437
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
business does anybody have any other

1438
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,680
business

1439
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,680
i'll just comment in general i mean as

1440
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
antoine had said in the beginning there

1441
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,440
there are several documents which people

1442
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,200
were holding back because they wanted to

1443
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,040
make sure that we resolved this question

1444
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,400
of these things

1445
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,559
and uh so we're hopeful that

1446
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,920
all of those are going to move along

1447
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,480
here uh quite smartly um there's a

1448
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
couple of them that we really do want

1449
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,720
and need going forward and george you

1450
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,640
know you should be raising your hand in

1451
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,400
the queue really yeah yeah

1452
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,599
screw the queue so

1453
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,240
i don't often do this but i would like

1454
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,400
to thank the chairs for their

1455
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
intervention into what has been

1456
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,640
a difficult

1457
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,559
conversation almost acrimonious

1458
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,000
and i think you added a lot of value i

1459
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,040
think you helped so thank you

1460
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,599
well thank you george um i know that i

1461
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,280
certainly appreciate that i see uh

1462
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,760
antoine nodding too it was tough for us

1463
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,280
we he and i had a

1464
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,200
several hours of conversation trying to

1465
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,720
figure out where to take this and what

1466
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,920
to do with it

1467
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
so uh thank you for that it certainly

1468
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,760
was a difficult topic and difficult

1469
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,200
thing to do

1470
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,319
so

1471
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,040
um but yeah so just a an outreach to the

1472
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,200
authors of those other four documents

1473
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,520
you know please do take this opportunity

1474
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,559
to

1475
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,480
make sure that you are aligned with all

1476
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,280
of this um i i think a couple of them

1477
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,520
have a little bit of wording changes

1478
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,680
editorial work to do and then let's move

1479
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
them along i think i'm most interested

1480
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,680
in the rdap in the uh redacted document

1481
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,200
would like to see that one move along

1482
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,880
very quickly that's just a personal

1483
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,640
observation

1484
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,920
but there are quite a number of them

1485
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,280
people should push them out as quick as

1486
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,079
they can

1487
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,200
jim gould go ahead please

1488
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,559
yeah i wanted to speak about the

1489
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,720
redacted uh draft uh where we do have a

1490
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,559
dependent we do have a dependency on the

1491
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,079
json path

1492
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,720
uh graph that's not an rfc yeah i

1493
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,319
believe they have a milestone going out

1494
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,680
to november

1495
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,079
um so i believe we're gonna have to wait

1496
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,680
for that

1497
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,558
just want to bring that up

1498
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,280
okay thank you and i'm sorry i was sort

1499
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,440
of ticking over the cue from uh antoine

1500
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,839
but yeah

1501
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,160
go ahead squads

1502
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,079
uh thank you guys uh scott holland back

1503
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,720
again uh so yeah just bringing the

1504
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,839
proposal

1505
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,079
conversation to closure antoine if i

1506
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,000
heard i think i heard you correctly one

1507
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,240
of you will send a note to the list

1508
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
yes just echoing what george had said

1509
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,839
say hey look this is what we discussed

1510
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,480
in the room this is the proposal

1511
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,559
and the idea would be that working group

1512
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,599
members would you know comment on the

1513
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,280
proposal at this point

1514
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,680
right so

1515
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,359
right the idea would be that will give

1516
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,799
you an opportunity to measure the

1517
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,319
consensus

1518
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,200
of

1519
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,599
of our approach to the proposal

1520
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,119
okay so

1521
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,760
jumping ahead just a little bit if we do

1522
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,920
agree that we have consensus on adopting

1523
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,880
that proposal i will volunteer to craft

1524
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,160
the errata report for 1983

1525
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,559
all right but i will wait until we i get

1526
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,480
to go ahead from you that yes we have

1527
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,400
consensus on this approach

1528
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,520
yeah

1529
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,720
and thank you for that scott but i think

1530
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,480
what i just understood from you it's not

1531
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,520
1983 that needs an update

1532
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,960
but it's actually uh 74.80 right because

1533
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,799
you wanted to change dunanic into lunar

1534
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,680
league's level zero

1535
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,319
uh no no no that actual example with the

1536
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,760
lunar next stuff it's it's an example in

1537
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,640
that's why okay

1538
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,079
yeah and that hint wording is also in

1539
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,440
1983.

1540
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,640
now that doesn't mean there isn't

1541
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,720
something someplace else it's i i just

1542
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,160
haven't seen anything anyplace else that

1543
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,240
i think rises to the level of adding to

1544
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240
this confusion that we've had

1545
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,599
okay because

1546
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,200
we were when we were discussing this we

1547
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,880
saw that you know the extension

1548
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,839
identifier for lunonic is in rlc's 7480

1549
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,599
section 8.1

1550
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,640
and um so that's where we thought all

1551
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,160
the confusion came from you know there's

1552
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,079
one rfc that talks about lunamic as an

1553
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,160
extension and there's another irc that

1554
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,480
says lunatic level zero as an extension

1555
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,040
but okay thank you no you're right uh we

1556
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,319
will uh um draft a um

1557
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,400
a conclusion for this discussion we will

1558
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,079
send it to the mailing list and thank

1559
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,240
you very much for volunteering to um

1560
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,640
to do the errata that are needed after

1561
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,759
we reach consensus

1562
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,359
and since we have three minutes left i

1563
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,359
ask again do we have any other business

1564
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,319
if not then we are perfectly on time and

1565
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,119
it's time for me to go to sleep

1566
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,799
i want to thank everybody else as well

1567
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,720
for especially for the people there who

1568
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,440
