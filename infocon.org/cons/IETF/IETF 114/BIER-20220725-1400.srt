21
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,080

24
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,600
sandy test testing for sandy

25
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,880

26
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920

oh

33
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,279
finally okay

34
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
i think it's the same thing she's

35
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
connected to a beat echo if it's coming

36
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
to speakers

37
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,160
how could it be she's only connected

38
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,959
remotely echo

39
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
okay

40
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
let's go to materials let's get this

41
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,959
thing um

42
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,880
that's got the agenda anyway doesn't it

43
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
it should

44
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
agenda it does all right

45
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,279
um

46
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,560
let's move this bike over here

47
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
we've done the test test test we think

48
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,120
we're functional it appears from what we

49
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
can tell we can hear each other on both

50
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,839
ends and i think i've got this thing

51
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,040
running like it's supposed to that

52
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
doesn't mean i'm correct

53
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
i only have a delusion of fat correct

54
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
right now so considering that time is we

55
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,800
should probably get this rolling

56
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
um i have not certain how the blues work

57
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,599
i think you need to scan outside

58
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
or scan this and then that

59
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
opens up does the auto blues like before

60
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,640
so we get both remote and

61
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,519
local

62
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
auto blues which is pretty darn nice

63
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
um this was supposed to oh i'm not

64
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
i have to take over

65
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
okay i have to take over as display

66
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,480
i have to share screen video

67
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,720
nope oh

68
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,390
[Laughter]

69
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,680

70
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000

71
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
going to have to reconnect here so give

72
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
me a second

73
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
i think we can reproduce that

74
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
fairly confident

75
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
hey and i'm back in

76
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839

controlling the slides

96
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
it's just to control the mic and the

97
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
camera in the room apparently it auto

98
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,120

yeah

116

118
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,639

119
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,560

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
reroute draft that's been adopted as

175
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
well

176
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
in last call hbls

177
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
we need uh

178
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,399
well need some review from what i

179
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,920
understand i think we had to go to

180
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
idr for review on that too didn't we i

181
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,479
think we already had that in parallel

182
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
and then from there on it moves into a

183
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
theme

184
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
we need shepherds

185
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,399
we need document shepherds

186
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
uh we have

187
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
our own man-man man here

188
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
who is uh in one of the reviews we're

189
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
waiting for his to be complete

190
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,160
php

191
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
beer and six and prefix redistribution

192
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,560
all need shepherds

193
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
it's a fairly straightforward process

194
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
there's a template you go through

195
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
q a you know do some hunting around to

196
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,320
make sure you're consistent with what

197
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
the questions are list response and

198
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,959
things

199
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
but it's it's not a heavy lift it's just

200
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
something that shouldn't be done

201
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
necessarily by the the authors of the

202
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
draft

203
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
so we'll go to the list we'll ask for

204
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,959

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,000
xiaohu xu before and he said he is no

269

some

271
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
other co-authors in the draft to pick up

272
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
the remaining the editing work

273
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000

274
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,919

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
close that piece of material

279
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,720
what's the one sharing mode i was told

280
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
sharing mode perfect

281
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,480
all right

282
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
first

283
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
item

284
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
beer multicast service

285
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
jeffrey

286
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
hello um

287
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
so the beer

288
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
or markus as a service draft was

289
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,720
recently adopted the working group

290
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
documents um

291
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,000
today i'm going to talk about a new

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,280
section that i added to the to the zero

293
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
one

294
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,120
version

295
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
um it's about the supporting beer in vpn

296
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
and it's actually

297
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,240
this came up as a one from one of the

298
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,679
comments from

299
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,960
fang hong

300
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
during the working group adoption

301
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
so this is supporting beer in vpn not

302
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,399
using beer for vpn next time please

303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,679
so the

304
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,000
basically let's say you have

305
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
your provider you're providing vpn

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
services and your vpn customers are

307
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
running beer what do you do how do you

308
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
support it next time

309
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
so this involves both overlay signaling

310
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
and underlay work

311
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
um

312
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
customers bear signaling um

313
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
then they can do the igp bgp signaling

314
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,320
in their own sites but when it comes to

315
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
over this provider core

316
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
we would use the bgp signaling the

317
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,600
existing

318
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,559
idr extensions for beer signaling

319
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,600
i believe it can be used for vpn ip

320
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
sapphire as well so you just attach your

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
beer information

322
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
to the vpn ips

323
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
and rois and then everything should

324
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
should work for the overlay signaling

325
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,400
part

326
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,360
now it comes when it comes to underlay

327
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
how do you get the customer beer traffic

328
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
across the

329
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
provider network there are two solutions

330
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
here one is that you just use ingress

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
replication

332
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,919
so when you do that

333
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,840
it's nothing different from regular beer

334
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
at all it's um now the

335
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,200
your

336
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,000
vr apps become the customers beer or

337
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
routers and it's

338
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,760
you just do the tunneling between the

339
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,480
bfrs nothing special at all

340
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
now another option is that

341
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
you forward

342
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
customers beer traffic

343
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
across the provider network using beer

344
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
itself

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,360
the reason to do that is that it gives

346
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
you um

347
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
efficient replication across provider

348
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,679
core

349
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,120
um you don't have to do the ingress

350
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
replication anymore

351
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,080
um

352
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,720
the the one issue with that is that

353
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
you to do that you need to

354
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
maintain the customer beer state

355
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
uh in underlay

356
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,000
and that is what this presentation is

357
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
about

358
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,440
next slide please

359
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
before we talk about the

360
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,320
underlay signaling

361
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
and stage for the

362
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
blvpn let's review the general spear

363
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
signaling and

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
pift calculation in the non-vpn case

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,120
so the bfr's a signal beer information

366
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
trvs attached to the beer prefixes

367
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,799
and and for the egress router

368
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,600
bf ir or bfer they would include their

369
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
bfr ids in the signaling

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
bftr which stands for beer folding

371
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,559
transit router they don't include the

372
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
bfr ids

373
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,559
um

374
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,840
so for each

375
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,200
beer folding table there is a beef id

376
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,080
for example it could be a beer label

377
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,799
the beer gift id ranges are also

378
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,720
included in the signaling

379
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,760
so

380
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,120
a beef id basically identifies a bift

381
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,200
for a particular subdomain comma set

382
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,679
tuple

383
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
now

384
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,640
how do we calculate that bift

385
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
um

386
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,799
we basically for each fifth entry

387
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,240
is corresponding to a bfer brs router we

388
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
find out how to reach that particular

389
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,559
bfer

390
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,520
we see that okay through the unicast

391
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,960
it's going to be

392
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,520
going through a next hop bfr neighbor

393
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
and that neighbor advertise a particular

394
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,960
label for this

395
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,000
subdomain comma set so then we put the

396
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
entry in the bits and the key for that

397
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,039
entry is the bfrd modulo the p-string

398
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,840
lens

399
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
the next top information for the entry

400
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,559
is basically the beer label from their

401
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,360
neighbor and a unix unique has four

402
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,279
information on how to reach their

403
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,640
neighbor

404
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,720
notice that the bf er's prefix here

405
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,240
is only used to find how to reach it

406
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,480
but it's not used in the beer folding

407
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
table in the beer folding table it's

408
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
just a bfr id

409
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,640
next slide

410
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
so now coming back how do we do peer

411
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,679
review signalling in the underlay

412
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
now

413
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,080
in the provider's underlay a beer sub

414
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
domain is now extended to include the

415
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
uh into a customer

416
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,039
in that in the tubule it's no longer

417
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
just a subdomain of the provider

418
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
spear domain it also you could have

419
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,640
you will have a

420
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,520
per customer subdomains there notice

421
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
that

422
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
your different beer

423
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,679
vpn customers they could have overlapped

424
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,720
subdomain ids or even bfr ids

425
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,840
so now we need to identify each beer

426
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
folding table

427
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
using

428
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,799
using a uh

429
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,880
additional piece of information here we

430
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
call it uh we use edit raw distinguisher

431
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,919
in the control plane

432
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,170
um

433
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,000
[Music]

434
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
but in the uh for in the following plane

435
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,919
it still just use the pixel id as before

436
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,760
like a beer label

437
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
and the

438
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
beer architecture initially

439
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
intentionally

440
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,760
made sure that

441
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,080
beef id itself is just opaque number it

442
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,640
does not carry any other semantics and

443
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,440
that

444
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
design allow us to do this now you can

445
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,279
extend

446
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,760
the sub domain to includes uh customer

447
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,840
information whatever but when the

448
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,360
folding plane the b5d is just

449
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
opaque number that maps to whatever

450
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,279
tuple you give it to give to it so

451
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,320
that's

452
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,080
a very good design that we are making

453
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,480
use of now

454
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,919
um

455
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,080
now

456
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,440
when it comes to um

457
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,039
signaling

458
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,760
now the pe routers and pe routers in the

459
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,000
underlay they will add it has beer

460
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
information trv

461
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
for their underlying loopbacks only

462
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,120
and

463
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,799
now inside the uh brt uh

464
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,159
info trv

465
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
they use they add

466
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
raw distinguisher

467
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
to

468
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
the subdomain id

469
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,799
and name

470
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
for the pes

471
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
they will include

472
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,200
a beer proxy range sub glv

473
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,320
to list

474
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,799
bfr ids

475
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,440
for customer bfers that are reachable

476
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
through that pe

477
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
that information is now used to

478
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,120
calculate uh

479
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,520
per customer or gifts

480
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
can i ask an understanding question sure

481
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
um

482
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
i'm lost at the point oh tell a second

483
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,520
um

484
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,159
behind a uh

485
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,720
in in the service provider domain um

486
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,360
let's assume a situation egress pe with

487
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
the two or three

488
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
um egress ce of the customer each of the

489
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
egress ce has has a bit in the bit

490
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
string

491
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,840
um

492
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
is that mapped one to one into the the

493
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
beer bit string in the core when you're

494
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,399
right when you do run it

495
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,320
so for each

496
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,039
for each customer

497
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,159
biffs in the on the on on the ce side

498
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
then there will be corresponding um

499
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,520
biffs

500
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
in the in the provider network itself so

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,559
it's a one-to-one mapping yes yeah and i

502
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,799
will talk about the scanning

503
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,200
implementation on that as well yeah

504
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
next thing

505
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,880
so this is a picture of the involved on

506
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
overlay and underlay signaling

507
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
we have those small clouds for customer

508
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
beer domains using igp or bgp signaling

509
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
they connect to the pes

510
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,600
and among those pes

511
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
you probably cannot see the color

512
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,720
clearly but here the purple color

513
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,559
is overly signaling

514
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,640
among the pes using the idr extensions

515
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,080
and then

516
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
in underlay

517
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
the peep

518
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
there is a provider beer and we

519
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
both the p routers and pe routers

520
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,320
they use igp or bgp signaling for

521
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
for both

522
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,399
provider domain beer and customer

523
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,120
and

524
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,760
customer beer domain signaling

525
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,320
next slide

526
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
so

527
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,840
the existing drafts

528
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
already talked about a provider

529
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
providing beer transport to multiple

530
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,679
clients which could be overlapping

531
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,559
but in that earlier version the

532
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,960
assumption was that those clients even

533
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
though they are different customers they

534
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
they would all be in the

535
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
same global table

536
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,559
and

537
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,480
and the beer prefixes

538
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
from the customers from the clients are

539
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,070
actually advertised into the underlay

540
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,679
[Music]

541
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
that

542
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,799
is changed

543
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
that can can stay but now with the vpn

544
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,640
mechanism and we can use the same

545
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,240
mechanism for vpn used for both vpn and

546
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
non-vpn cases we basically instead of

547
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
leaking the

548
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,799
customer

549
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,200
prefix into the uh

550
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
into the uh underlay we are using the or

551
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
just leaking the

552
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,080
customer bfr ids into the underlay and

553
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
that makes use of the

554
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,880
gear proxy range subjects and that is

555
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,840
added in the into the zero zero one uh

556
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
revision

557
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,519
just like version of the mic

558
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,519
huawei for the beer whipping i think

559
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,399
english replication is the best solution

560
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,399
because as you said

561
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,320
it has a low air state on the key motors

562
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,279
to nick the client pfid range to provide

563
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
a network

564
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,480
is not a hierarchical solution i think

565
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,279
it somewhat violates the traditional

566
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,919
weapon architecture

567
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,840
because either of the clan bfr prefix

568
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,679
clan afrid or client bfid range is the

569
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
root information of the client network

570
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,240
leaking them into provider network this

571
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,440
is a scalable problems

572
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,279
in addition i think you should check

573
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,399
whether it is beyond the scope of the

574
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,360
charter of the year working group and

575
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,279
whether it is under the

576
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,760
current beer architecture

577
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
i think it is somewhat beyond what

578
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,399
current beer working group can do

579
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,719
thanks

580
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,679
um i have some i have one slide uh

581
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,600
regarding the scaling considerations

582
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,039
um if that should not be the last uh

583
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,919
slide or or is it can you

584
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,039
yeah

585
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,159
yeah

586
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
so uh indeed now um

587
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,480
we have uh customer specific specific

588
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,919
information in the provider network

589
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,799
basically it's per customer or

590
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,799
beer folding tables

591
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,840
and

592
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,960
that

593
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
is

594
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
basically a trade-off between the

595
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,960
efficient replication and additional

596
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
states

597
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,679
now as for the additional states

598
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,080
i want to point out today

599
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,200
in the mvpn or evpn when you do

600
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,039
selective tunneling

601
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,120
you are essentially

602
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,679
adding additional state in the provider

603
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,720
network

604
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,679
for corresponding the customer flows

605
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,399
um you for you for example you could

606
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,360
have

607
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,399
one

608
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,240
p2mp tunnel for every customer flow

609
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
uh in in the provider network

610
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,559
that is the precedence and of course

611
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,679
uh the provider has to make a choice to

612
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,640
decide do am i going to use ingress

613
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,040
replication or using the

614
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,560
uh uh using the inclusive tunnel for all

615
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
my customer traffic

616
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,480
um sometimes that's

617
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,839
that may not work well because just

618
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:19,839
because the

619
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,960
the amount of uh additional replication

620
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,800
and in you know provider networks that's

621
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,119
not going to work out it's not it's not

622
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,480
economical

623
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,918
um so here is the similar situation

624
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,440
yes ingress replication among the

625
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,159
vrfs will work it does not have the

626
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,359
states but if you do the

627
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,239
uh

628
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
introduce additional

629
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
customer gift state in the

630
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,119
provider network it provides a trade uh

631
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,599
efficient replication and you as a

632
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
provider you can control

633
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,359
how many

634
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
uh uh customer

635
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
base

636
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,960
to be supported in your provider network

637
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
is compromised

638
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520
and

639
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,560
my thinking is that if the multicast or

640
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
beer demand

641
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
picks up

642
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,400
this solution is acceptable and it's

643
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,040
actually feasible and it's worthy that's

644
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,800
my view

645
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
thomas eckhardt again i think the the

646
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,440
key difference is not even starting from

647
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,320
the

648
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
number of states that you have but how

649
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
you can plan it right it moves it from

650
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,440
application created state which even the

651
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,520
operator of the customer site may not be

652
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,760
able to well control to um

653
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
uh operator control right so the number

654
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,680
of bits are controlled by the customer

655
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
operator so that can be brought to be a

656
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,320
no number obviously right so

657
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,599
that's that that's that's the main

658
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,200
benefit i think

659
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
it's a lot more controllable

660
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,040
um here is the um the the provider can

661
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,560
still has control right so

662
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,640
that's what i meant in terms of it

663
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
don't you don't even need to argue about

664
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,640
the numbers but about the plan ability

665
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
of the numbers

666
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
you cannot plan

667
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,520
you know when applications are starting

668
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,240
to uh to to create flows

669
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,119
right

670
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,880
right this is great but just to help

671
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
clarify what toronto is trying to say

672
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,680
you're comparing this to traditional ip

673
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
multicast mvpn where it's all flow-based

674
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,640
state it's all unbounded it's driven by

675
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
applications as opposed to the provider

676
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,079
and you still have this date on the pe

677
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,440
of the service provider when you're

678
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,359
running traditional beer only in the

679
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,040
service provider you still have that

680
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,480
state there now you're pushing it back

681
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,079
to wherever the customer wants to have

682
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,839
it and from the customer you're only

683
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,839
getting a planable

684
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,280
accountable

685
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,839
chargeable number of bits kind of

686
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,520
distributed via the bit string so it's a

687
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,280
totally different model it's not kind of

688
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,040
compare sizes it's called

689
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,839
i think

690
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,760
yeah like these are comments in support

691
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,280
yeah but it's from toronto thank you

692
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
determined

693
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,839
i mean

694
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,520
see it's i mean he didn't bring them up

695
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
in the first place so they're

696
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
we need to work out a little bit better

697
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
marketing of this because obviously

698
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
pushing out

699
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
native ip multicast so to speak from the

700
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,640
pes would be a giant step forward

701
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
thanks yeah

702
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,720
and tony p juniper is the first tourist

703
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,200
marketing will warn theirs overseas

704
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,520
now i have a technical comment on the

705
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,359
igp redistribution so uh if we extend

706
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,920
the beer information with the rd

707
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
uh then the computation is basically

708
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,119
different primary key and um the whole

709
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,880
igp will have to support it to work

710
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,720
correctly which can be done

711
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
um but what i suggest is to add to igp

712
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,800
kind of a

713
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
capability indication in the router

714
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,240
description so you know that you're

715
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,520
dealing with people who can actually

716
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
support this rd or otherwise whatever

717
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,200
you have it partitioned or you know you

718
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
have to deal operationally with the

719
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
issue yeah

720
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,160
thanks

721
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,400
next slide

722
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,760
yeah i think that's probably the last

723
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,200
one

724
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,000
just

725
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
try it next slide any more questions

726
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
comments

727
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
we have

728
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,839
one comment

729
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,520
oh sandy volunteered to take minutes we

730
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
already have it done all right we got to

731
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,040
handle sandy thank you though

732
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
all right

733
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
thanks jeff friends

734
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,359
excellent

735
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,400
next our next is yours also i think so

736
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,720
here we go

737
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,240
okay so uh this is a new draft uh

738
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
from uh uh co-authors uh in juniper zt

739
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,720
channel mobile and nokia

740
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,839
next slide

741
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,440
it's actually a follow-up of

742
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,839
two drafts

743
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,839
and the presentation

744
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,320
i did in lasa etf we had some

745
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,160
discussions on the beer extension header

746
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,040
it's based on the mqs extension header

747
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,079
drafts

748
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,040
and we strive for

749
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
design and generic generic header

750
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,240
extension mechanisms that is aligned

751
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,839
with nqos and ipv6 extension header

752
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,160
so that we can support

753
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
some generic functions

754
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
with the same extension header and

755
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,000
whether it is for mpos or br or ipv6 and

756
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,160
we also strive for multi-vendor support

757
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,839
of this proposal

758
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,720
and

759
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,960
you will notice that

760
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
we have pretty much major vendors in

761
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
this draft except

762
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
we're trying to still get cisco's

763
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,640
support

764
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,200
next slide

765
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
so there is a

766
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
illustration of the header definition at

767
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,520
the very top is original beer header it

768
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,400
would have

769
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
its protofield will have a value to say

770
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,839
that the beer extension header follows

771
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,400
and at the beginning of that

772
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,920
there is a

773
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,240
header of extension header and then

774
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,400
followed by the extension headers could

775
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
be multiple of them

776
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,799
next slide

777
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,079
now um

778
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
the header of extension headers

779
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,440
um

780
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,480
the there is the first four bits the

781
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,720
reserve field uh it's really just for

782
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,319
it's a enable because this could be used

783
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,040
for npos as well we want to be able to

784
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
see that don't treat this as an ip

785
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,160
packet

786
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,480
and next one is a counter of the

787
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
extension header

788
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,839
followed by the

789
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,560
extension header total lens

790
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,599
followed by the original upper layer

791
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,880
protocol type

792
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,280
that's the real payload after

793
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
extension header

794
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,960
then is the next hop

795
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,280
type

796
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,680
indicating the the real the type of the

797
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,160
real next hub following this header of

798
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,480
extension header this value of this next

799
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,440
hop field is from the

800
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,480
internet protocol numbers registry

801
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
remember that we strive to

802
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,359
use the same extension header

803
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,440
mechanism for all

804
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,040
protocol layers mpos b or ipv6 therefore

805
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
we want to use this uh

806
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,040
address the number space from the ip

807
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
protocol numbers

808
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
and that way if there is a ip extension

809
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,920
header for a function that can be

810
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,400
applicable uh can be applied to beer or

811
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,280
mpos we will just use reuse the ipv6

812
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
extension header

813
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,040
now the

814
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,720
the key

815
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,000
the the real that there are two main uh

816
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,720
fields here are critical here

817
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,000
uh total um

818
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
i shouldn't say uh

819
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
critical but it's important that total

820
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
extension header lens

821
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,880
gives you the ability to

822
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
to directly locate where the payload is

823
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,920
for whatever reason um without going

824
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,079
through the headers one by one

825
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,960
the next hop header or value using the

826
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,359
uh ip protocol number space

827
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,200
allows you to do the uh use reuse ipv6

828
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,800
extension headers

829
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
number of

830
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,119
headers

831
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,560
uh in this one um i've heard from some

832
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,720
people saying that

833
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,599
you

834
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,400
may

835
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,200
not need that or you may not want there

836
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,599
i want it there for example if you have

837
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,040
to remove a

838
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,079
header

839
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,240
and you may need to uh

840
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,800
update this field why bother including

841
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
it there just as long as you have the

842
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,520
total lens each everything should work

843
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,400
fine

844
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,640
that's um yeah um

845
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
we can discuss that

846
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
with mpos the co-authors as well yeah

847
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,078
next

848
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,160
oh i already talked about that why do we

849
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,680
want this one

850
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,040
beer header

851
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,920
protofield itself is a six bits with its

852
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,040
own space

853
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,440
now we when we use this one we can reuse

854
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,319
the

855
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,280
uh ipv6 extension headers for whatever

856
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
function now i do want to point out uh

857
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,640
using the internet protocol number space

858
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,760
does not mean that every time we design

859
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,000
a new beer extension header we have to

860
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,440
allocate a number

861
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,760
from that ipv6 uh

862
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,079
registry no we only need one number

863
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,640
that number will just means that

864
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
the next header

865
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,599
is a

866
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,440
really extension header

867
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,079
that is not about the ip it it could be

868
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,319
that this could be for mpos for vf or

869
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,480
whatever we only need one

870
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
number from that registry

871
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,880
um if if um

872
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,640
if you know that you're dealing with a

873
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,720
beer or encapsulation you know that's uh

874
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,119
that would be beer specific if you know

875
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:51,920
if

876
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,480
you're doing the mpos you know it's mpl

877
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
specific

878
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,799
next slide

879
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,440
so now extension header

880
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
it's just like ipv6

881
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,720
we added one optional extension

882
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,079
field there

883
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,720
uh basically let's say that we have to

884
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,680
define

885
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,040
five

886
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,680
mpos appear specific extension headers

887
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,520
for beer functions

888
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,040
we get one

889
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,079
number from ipv6 ip protocol number

890
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,960
registry and then we can define

891
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,079
uh

892
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,760
uh

893
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,560
we can allocate five

894
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
extension and

895
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
value for that field in in this picture

896
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,680
and so that they can

897
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,599
represent different functions uh with

898
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,079
different beer extension headers

899
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,800
um we could also have one extension

900
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,640
value assigned

901
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,760
to indicate that um

902
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
for this sphere extension header there

903
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,920
are multiple tlbs

904
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,000
for different uh functions

905
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,599
so they could

906
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,960
there are different ways to do things

907
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,520
you can have one extension value for

908
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,720
each spear specific extension

909
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,040
function or you can have one extension

910
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,480
value

911
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,520
to using different tlvs to encode

912
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,359
different information for different

913
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,880
functions

914
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,839
next slide

915
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,880
so um seeking comments and suggestions

916
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,839
we try to try to reach consensus from

917
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,839
major vendors and operators

918
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,200
um i mentioned that we already have

919
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,359
quite some major vendors here

920
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,240
uh

921
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,119
that draft song is uh draft itself is

922
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,839
from huawei so i assume uh well that

923
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,160
that's the implication that

924
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,880
implies that we we do want to work with

925
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,599
all the mentors including huawei to to

926
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,880
uh to support this

927
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,079
thanks

928
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,880
any other comments or questions

929
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,160
no one in the queue

930
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,119
all right

931
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,640
great stuff thanks chase

932
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,200
one more

933
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,720
where'd this come from

934
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,000
sandy

935
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,960
awesome

936
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,920
yeah

937
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,480
okay so we need to get sandy on the mic

938
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,359
sandy can you hear us

939
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,800
yeah i can't hear you can you hear me

940
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,079
i can hear you

941
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,400
all right you see the slides

942
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,359
yes

943
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,520
we got you all right go ahead teddy

944
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,440
thank you

945
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,640
okay okay thank you and hello everyone

946
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,880
i'm sandy zhang from zte this

947
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,920
presentation is bift id signaling for

948
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,280
brte

949
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,119
we have calls our rioja

950
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,359
yeah can you speak louder

951
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,480
closer to mike maybe

952
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,280
if this is better

953
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,960
hello

954
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,960
a little bit and we need more than that

955
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,960
okay

956
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,079
the steam slag there is very loud

957
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,559
echo

958
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,319
yeah we only have one speaker in the

959
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,079
room that seems to be

960
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,319
uh

961
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,599
yeah just do your best to go slow and

962
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,920
loud

963
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,400
okay

964
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,640
if this is better

965
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,599
hello

966
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,839
yes that's better hello

967
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,640
hello okay

968
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,280
okay okay

969
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,720
thank you um

970
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,079
should i repeat

971
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,040
the first page again

972
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,319
oh okay

973
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,440
let's move the uh this background

974
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,240
okay

975
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,319
from the brt architecture we know that

976
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,720
drt uses explicit passes to forward

977
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,680
multicast packet in vr domain

978
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,839
the path can be calculated by the

979
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,520
controller

980
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,480
every bit position of the bit string in

981
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,520
a brt packet indicates one or more

982
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,720
agencies

983
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,400
instead of a bfer as in beer

984
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,160
brte in each bfr has no routing table

985
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,079
but only a brte forwarding table indexed

986
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,960
by

987
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,000
a set identifier bit operation and

988
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,280
populated with only those agencies to

989
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,480
which the bfr should replicate

990
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,079
pex2

991
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,240
as described in brte architecture all

992
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,520
the beer encapsulation methods apply to

993
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,800
brte

994
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
such as nprs

995
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
ethernet or br insects

996
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,720
next please

997
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
the brt forwarding is achieved by the

998
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,280
beer header too but the composition of

999
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
bit string and the forwarding table is

1000
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
different from beer

1001
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,079
we know that the bift id is used to

1002
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,160
locate the forwarding table of the

1003
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
packet

1004
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,599
in order to distinguish the forwarding

1005
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,160
table used by brte the bift id in beer

1006
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,839
header needs to be different from beer

1007
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,720
next please

1008
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,680
for the bift id signaling let's take

1009
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,680
isis protocol as an example in order to

1010
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,280
support mpls internet and the bearing

1011
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,119
sex encapsulation

1012
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,359
we advertise the mprs and non-fprs

1013
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,800
encapsulation sub-sub-to-v associated

1014
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,680
with

1015
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,319
brte in for sub-top

1016
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,839
which is defined in draft itf brte is is

1017
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,760
and the beer's ipv6 encapsulation sub

1018
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,960
sub sub trv can be advertised

1019
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,400
in case the node wants to use brin6

1020
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,839
encapsulation instead of internet

1021
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,720
all the advertisements are similar with

1022
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,880
fc

1023
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,680
8401 and the draft lsr mpls extension

1024
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,720
in case both of the mpos and the

1025
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
non-mpos

1026
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,960
encapsulation sub sub tovs are

1027
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,200
advertised by one node

1028
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,319
the label in mpls encapsulation

1029
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,280
sub sub to v and the fifth id in

1030
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,400
non-ampus encapsulation sub-subtle v

1031
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,960
should not be overlapped

1032
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,040
the second only in ospf and ospf v3 is

1033
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,040
similar

1034
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,640
so

1035
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,040
that's all any comments

1036
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,960
all right let's come under the mic

1037
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,359
uh tallest eckerd yeah um

1038
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,040
sorry i still haven't didn't have the

1039
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,640
time to um

1040
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,240
come out to conclusion with this i'll

1041
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
i'll certainly be happy to support it

1042
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,520
from the r for from the um brte side we

1043
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,960
you know the

1044
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,839
uh soon to be rfc has is describing you

1045
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,040
know

1046
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,280
at least two high-level models of how to

1047
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,160
share the si and sd space with beer and

1048
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,000
i think depending on what we want to do

1049
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,319
there that may have an impact on what we

1050
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,319
do in the signaling plane so i hope

1051
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,920
hopefully we can have more productive

1052
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,280
discussion about that on the list

1053
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,440
jeffrey from juniper um

1054
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,240
so i had a comment uh for uh another

1055
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,480
draft from uh why more

1056
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,040
i had the same comment applied here

1057
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,960
um i saw a response from from primo but

1058
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,200
i sorry i haven't got a chance to reply

1059
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,559
but here

1060
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,720
my understanding is when it comes to

1061
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,480
brte

1062
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,680
we have two things to worry about

1063
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,520
a bit one is the bf fifth id and the

1064
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,720
other one is the content of the dips

1065
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,079
in case of a regular beer each

1066
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,200
bfr will calculate the contents of

1067
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,559
uh the fifths but when it comes to brte

1068
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,800
my understanding that

1069
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,400
each bfr

1070
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,079
only needs to care about

1071
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,880
its local or the big positions for its

1072
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,800
local adjacencies whether it's

1073
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,760
direct adjacency or router agencies

1074
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,559
so

1075
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,440
and that that information is better

1076
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,240
populated from a controller

1077
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,520
and instead of using igp to signal

1078
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,160
and if you do use the controller to

1079
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,280
signal

1080
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,319
uh uh to pro to provision those uh

1081
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,040
content of the bits then

1082
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,160
then the bit id itself can also be

1083
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,240
signaled as part of that provisioning

1084
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,720
instead of using ige signaling

1085
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,520
um as i mentioned um i have not got a

1086
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,960
chance to

1087
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,720
further discussion with my mom but i

1088
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,839
think this is uh this is related to

1089
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,440
the discussion as well

1090
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,800
this is great just for clarification

1091
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,480
you're talking about assigning the bits

1092
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,720
from the controller assigning the bits

1093
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,880
uh yes uh well so assigning the bits uh

1094
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,000
is a part of a planning process and then

1095
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,640
how do you get the space to the router

1096
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,520
and

1097
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,599
it's in the old days you may you for

1098
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
example in the old days you allo you

1099
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,920
assign a loopback address and then you

1100
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,359
write down a piece of paper and include

1101
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,359
the router and enter it

1102
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,760
here is similar you assign the bits and

1103
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,839
then you you need to put it into the

1104
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,160
router how to put it in the router

1105
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,000
nowadays you can use the controller or

1106
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,319
something once you do that

1107
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,680
then you

1108
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,400
you uh as part of that as a provisioning

1109
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,319
you you could use uh to do the big

1110
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,040
signal uh to assign the fifth ids as

1111
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,720
well

1112
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,959
thanks

1113
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,720
hello

1114
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,319
hello

1115
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,119
okay

1116
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,559
um we know that there is a working group

1117
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,720
document about jabir

1118
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,799
t young and and in that draft the the

1119
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,880
ftid or the

1120
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
agency's bp can

1121
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,480
also be assigned by the controller and

1122
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,599
can be downloaded to the devices to

1123
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,040
run for it

1124
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,760
so

1125
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,060
um

1126
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,599
[Music]

1127
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,640
so

1128
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,240
if we do this work or by controller the

1129
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,000
brt young is enough to do this work

1130
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,400
in case we want to use igp for signaling

1131
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,440
the bit operation of agencies

1132
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,040
maybe we also needed to advertise the

1133
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,680
gift id for the

1134
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,359
working table

1135
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,799
looking up

1136
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,799
yeah

1137
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,760
any more comments

1138
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,680
looks like we'll have an active

1139
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,200
discussion on this on the list some good

1140
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,279
feedback uh thank you sandy

1141
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,839
all right that is the end of our agenda

1142
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,920
i would call this by far the quickest

1143
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,400
beer working group meeting we've had

1144
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,079
um probably the least animated we've had

1145
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,960
if we went like

1146
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,440
yes even though we started a good point

1147
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,440
actually if i even docked that time off

1148
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,920
we're about 45 minutes then of actual

1149
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,240
operator operation here uh normally

1150
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,000
we're pushing our two hour window and

1151
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,119
people are chasing us out the room so at

1152
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,640
giving the point give some okay we have

1153
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,880
an a.d who's going to give us some

1154
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,720
wisdom

1155
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,160
i've actually just been there's been a

1156
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,839
bit of discussion on the iesg and i have

1157
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,720
been

1158
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,359
thought that we would remind people just

1159
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,480
while you're in the meetings if you're

1160
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,839
not at the mic

1161
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,319
please wear your masks we there are

1162
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,079
people testing positive that aren't

1163
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,760
wearing masks and

1164
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,160
the masks are mandatory so i just needed

1165
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,440
to please say if you're in the session

1166
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,160
and

1167
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
you're not at the microphone talking

1168
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,960
please wear the masks but other than

1169

thank you andrew

1175
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,559
let's make sure this is not a super

1176
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,280
spreader event

1177
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,359
oh one more my question go ahead yeah

1178
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,119
well it's not a question it's a comment

1179
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,880
being nokia

1180
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,040
should be in the next ietf

1181
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,000
uh come up with some beer success

1182
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,079
stories uh

1183
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,680
i don't know whether that's part of the

1184
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,079
itf or not but just you know show some

1185
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,880
of the deployments for

1186
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,720
uh

1187
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,799
is lenny here but he's here

1188
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,680
so isn't there some work in i2 where uh

1189
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,760
european i2 they've got some p4

1190
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,960
implementations of beer and they're

1191
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,160
doing some

1192
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,200
actual

1193
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,839
live testing now

1194
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,559
uh yeah there's um

1195
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,359
uh

1196
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,839
they presented it at mbondi

1197
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,839
last meeting or the one before

1198
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,880
um

1199
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,640
it's

1200
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,079
one of it's the french uh and ran uh

1201
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,200
renator

1202
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,319
oh yeah

1203
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,880
they have a network called rare net uh

1204
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,799
and it is a network of

1205
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,400
uh tofino switches um

1206
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,079
p4 switches

1207
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,720
that they implemented beer on and it is

1208
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,599
a beer network um

1209
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,960
it's a global

1210
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,640
network

1211
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,720
rna network

1212
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,960
that includes that that does have beer

1213
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,040
running and

1214
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,079
they added an amt relay

1215
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,319
and a unicast multicast translator so um

1216
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,839
so yeah uh

1217
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,079
come to mbondi um or check out um

1218
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,400
we would love to you know uh there's

1219
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,160
there's a mailing list that talks about

1220
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,680
this deployment

1221
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,760
but it's a pretty neat uh deployment and

1222
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,720
it's

1223
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,880
it's exciting because it um

1224
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,880
it has the confluence of both beer and

1225
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,640
amt

1226
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,920
which is

1227
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,760
kind of a interesting you know very

1228
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,359
promising mix um so yeah

1229
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,960
that's a that's a cool network to take a

1230
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,000
look at

1231
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,440
can you send me the links or send them

1232
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,760
to the list and then yeah sure okay

1233
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,520
definitely if i don't

1234
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,640
i forgot so just remind me yeah okay um

1235
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,319
i i can also add that uh

1236
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,520
since since you asked greg um

1237
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,480
we are

1238
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,920
or um we'd love to have in mbondi um

1239
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,200
your other working group don't forget

1240
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,880
about us um

1241
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,240
if there are um operational

1242
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,119
where are we with beer do you are we

1243
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,160
ready for operational considerations and

1244
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,040
are we ready for um

1245
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,319
ops documents and drafts in mbondi

1246
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,920
pertaining to beer because i think that

1247
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,839
would you know if we're at that point

1248
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:56,160
now we very much welcome that in bundy

1249
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,559
thank you lenny for off the cuff there

1250
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,880
appreciate it next jeffrey from juniper

1251
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,760
so

1252
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,839
as a multicast engineer

1253
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,599
i've always said the

1254
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
beer is the best mouse

1255
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,119
multicast technology i have since

1256
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,200
um

1257
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,760
but this deployment has been kind of

1258
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,760
disappointing

1259
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,839
mainly because it's

1260
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,680
new encapsulation new forwarding

1261
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,880
algorithm and therefore you neither need

1262
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,680
a programmable chips or you need brand

1263
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,359
new chips

1264
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,480
and

1265
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,079
that gives us a chicken egg problem

1266
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,599
there have been many customers who

1267
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,760
wanted to do beer they talked to us to

1268
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,240
many vendors and they said oh you cannot

1269
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,559
do this yet oh you cannot do this on all

1270
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,280
platforms therefore they back off when

1271
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,559
they back off

1272
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,200
the vendors also back up they say oh no

1273
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,280
not many customers wanted so this kind

1274
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,280
of chicken and egg problem

1275
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,280
is what prevents

1276
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
white deployment

1277
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,839
but

1278
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:00,210
um

1279
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,319
[Music]

1280
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,119
prime pioneer vendors and pioneer

1281
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,880
operators

1282
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,760
will break the chicken negative active

1283
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,520
dilemma and

1284
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,480
i am optimistic that

1285
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,920
it will happen

1286
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,160
and in the near future

1287
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,399
thanks jeffrey

1288
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,240
no no sorry i have a lot of back pain i

1289
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,160
can't stand a lot um

1290
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,760
what was it three points so the first

1291
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,720
one just to retaliate on your great um

1292
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,400
recommendation the beginning for for

1293
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,880
chairs me um

1294
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,240
for the people in the room please make

1295
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,760
sure that you are locked in at least

1296
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,359
once into meet echo because that's how

1297
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,520
you're getting counted right so you want

1298
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,079
to know that for the room size next time

1299
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,480
um and uh sorry it was too late for this

1300
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,799
meeting here but uh that's so there is

1301
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,559
the on-site tool we should all use this

1302
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,319
for the microphone line i never

1303
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,680
understood it i don't think we need it

1304
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,839
for the microphone line but kind of for

1305
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,839
counting how many people are in in the

1306
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,760
room and and the

1307
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,440
proceedings i think that's that's very

1308
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,440
useful because we don't have blue sheets

1309
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,839
um taurus for some clarity i'm logged in

1310
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,440
here at the laptop that counts me as

1311
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,799
well though i don't have to i hope so

1312
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,720
yes yeah okay

1313
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,079
but for those who aren't in media echo

1314
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,920
they can just use the scan and then get

1315
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,280
on the blue projector or you just use

1316
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,960
the tool whatever i haven't figured out

1317
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,680
i need to ask the the tooling people how

1318
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,160
they in the proceeding actually you know

1319
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
count the stuff but if if you're not on

1320
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,599
any online tool they can't count you

1321
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,640
yeah

1322
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,160
yeah it's all done automated now yeah

1323
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,720
exactly um the sheets are no longer blue

1324
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,520
right

1325
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,559
um

1326
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,160
there was something in the middle i

1327
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,400
forgot okay uh h

1328
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,039
and then um yeah i mean

1329
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,640
hope you don't find this offensive but

1330
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,880
really you know come positively mood it

1331
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,599
to the msr six path right and consider

1332
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,480
that you know this this whole technology

1333
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,720
maybe can can use another even more

1334
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,799
maybe researchy and and longer term

1335
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,799
solution because one of the things we

1336
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,720
specifically haven't achieved is getting

1337
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,799
really into host stacks and i think that

1338
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,520
just by taking the word ipv6 on on it

1339
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,839
and making native v6 we we may have to

1340
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,119
get it better let's not have the

1341
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,480
discussion here because encapsulation

1342
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,680
doesn't dictate uh hosts oh no

1343
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,599
all i'm saying is just just just come

1344
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,079
with a positive attitude right let's

1345
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,640
let's not you know dwell on tasks yeah i

1346
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,640
think thanks

1347
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,879
thanks

1348
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,440
greg mursky erickson um

1349
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,640
i really

1350
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,000
appreciate the ask for um

1351
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,440
more uh ops related

1352
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,640
information

1353
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,640
and i think that

1354
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,599
that's what oem is for

1355
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,720
so it's basically using us our alphabet

1356
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,079
soup it's a

1357
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,359
operation administration maintenance so

1358
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,920
i'm part of this effort and

1359
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,880
as

1360
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,520
chairs noted

1361
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,280
working on

1362
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,520
being document and ping document then

1363
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,200
enable us

1364
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,559
to progress

1365
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,079
mtu discovery and bfd documents

1366
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,000
so i hope that will be a good addition

1367
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,839
to the ops related

1368
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,440
suite excellent

1369
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,880
thank you

1370
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,240
one more

1371
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,119
yeah uh who my big goal in nokia um just

1372
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,839
to comment on the chicken and egg issue

1373
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,480
i do agree on that

1374
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,799
but i guess there's a lot of great work

1375
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,480
in this working group there's a lot of

1376
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,160
drafts that are

1377
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,960
trying to address different parts of the

1378
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,880
beer technology

1379
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,640
but for the

1380
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,359
providers well not providers for the

1381
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,000
main companies that are implementing

1382
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,039
beer

1383
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,720
i would imagine that we want to

1384
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,200
concentrate on a set of

1385
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,039
functionality

1386
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,799
that we can interrupt

1387
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,640
very nicely with each other

1388
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,520
and get this thing going right because

1389
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,599
as you said we need like let's be honest

1390
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,920
here we need the deployments

1391
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,000
to start putting more

1392
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,240
technology into our routers

1393
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,480
if we don't have the deployments

1394
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,319
you know there are other

1395
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,520
uh

1396
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,200
higher priority stuff that you know

1397
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,359
companies will start working on so

1398
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,359
that's all i'm trying to point out is

1399
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,400
that maybe you know in the next meeting

1400
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,039
we can talk about some of the main

1401
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,920
pieces of beer work that we need to

1402
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,319
implement on all

1403
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,720
uh these companies you know the tier one

1404
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,000
companies that

1405
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,280
that we are

1406
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,400
so we can get this thing up and deployed

1407
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,960
in the customer side a little bit more

1408
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,640
again i don't know whether this is itf

1409
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,640
or this is offline conversation that's

1410
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,319
the part i'm kind of wondering you know

1411
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,359
how we can tackle that

1412
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,640
just a quick reply um and maybe you know

1413
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,960
i told the secret again um

1414
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,440
maybe looking into what what we all came

1415
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,039
here for service provider and the wide

1416
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,960
area isn't the only you know thing we

1417
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,119
can attack right so data centers we've

1418
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,520
seen michael menth and and companies you

1419
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,400
know p4 implementation so data center

1420
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,240
may be more ripe even though we may not

1421
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,520
be the ones that have the best

1422
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,760
connections there but maybe just talking

1423
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,520
to the right people right and

1424
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,799
uh j2 broadcom has support now that's a

1425
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,799
huge step

1426
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,079
okay

1427
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,720
it's vancouver from deutsche telekom uh

1428
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,480
so from the network operator side

1429
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,680
um

1430
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,520
the chicken and egg problem which have

1431
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,079
been from mentioned from jeffrey and

1432
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,880
human and also the operations

1433
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,119
management side mentioned from greg

1434
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,440
are very relevant to us because

1435
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,599
for us it's always the question how

1436
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,200
interoperable is

1437
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,520
is this stuff because

1438
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,200
it's not a secret we are not on a single

1439
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,640
vendor strategy

1440
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,200
um so that point one is very important

1441
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,680
but the other point as well is

1442
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,920
um that we are getting challenged

1443
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,720
internally also a lot how many others of

1444
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,200
our

1445
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,640
of other telcos are using it are they

1446
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,079
using it

1447
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,359
in

1448
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,680
the backbone or is that a data center

1449
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,880
technology because this determines for

1450
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,599
for us also how mature is the technology

1451
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,079
to use um or are we

1452
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,400
the first one or are we the only one

1453
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,480
demanding it because this has also

1454
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,760
obviously

1455
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,799
in the long run implications on

1456
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,960
how well is it maintained how well is it

1457
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,760
tested how well is it

1458
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,319
developed further for on for upcoming

1459
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,480
feature sets so

1460
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,680
having somewhere a source

1461
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,559
other than personal contacts to

1462
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,440
get a grasp of how many

1463
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,359
providers are interested and how many

1464
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,000
providers are using it and for which

1465
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,799
cases would be really beneficial also

1466
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:53,920
for

1467
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,000
me and my arguments to use it internally

1468
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,920
to develop it further

1469
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,960
and

1470
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,760
yeah to to give it also some more um

1471
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,440
relevance in order

1472
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,480
in contrast of implementation

1473
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,520
excellent

1474
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,520
so if i can just wrap this up with my

1475
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,119
experience in this as well

1476
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,280
i haven't spoken to a single vendor who

1477
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,880
looked at this and said oh i don't like

1478
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,920
it

1479
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,520
it's always when can i get it what

1480
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,198
platform is it on you know how many

1481
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,640
platforms support it but then you get to

1482
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,960
that who else is doing it there's that

1483
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,120
coward state right which i understand

1484
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,120
but this is forwarding plane this is

1485
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,880
just not another routing protocol this

1486
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,238
is the forwarding plane so it's the

1487
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,399
narrow part of the hourglass is the big

1488
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,279
challenge it's new hardware and just to

1489
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,040
your point jeffrey too

1490
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,960
not all programmable chips give you that

1491
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,640
option because it requires header

1492
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,719
manipulation post replication if there's

1493
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,560
not a pipeline to do that you have no

1494
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,640
programmable path to do it so even

1495
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,000
programmable chips aren't necessarily

1496
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,359
ready for this

1497
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,040
so it it's it's a heavy lift um

1498
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,040
even if the implementation is simple

1499
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,238
it's still

1500
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,238
more bits

1501
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,238
so i also just wanted to add that you

1502
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,359
know as as taking off my 80 hat and

1503
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,359
speaking as an operator one of the

1504
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,600
things we've been working on internally

1505
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,839
are certain routing devices etc that are

1506
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,839
more tailored for the african market

1507
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,520
size-wise etc

1508
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,198
and we are working to implement a lot of

1509
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,120
the stuff in our stuff in our products

1510
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,560
as well

1511
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,560
excited

1512
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,560
wait tauros has another comment yeah on

1513
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,520
on

1514
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,000
on your rant um just just going back you

1515
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,319
know original multicast was also pushed

1516
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,198
in the market by software

1517
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,120
implementations right so that's the

1518
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,960
question what is the strategies that we

1519
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,799
that we you know find marketplaces where

1520
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,799
that happens and then you know the big

1521
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,719
elephants are getting moved last right

1522
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,238
so that's that's always been the problem

1523
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,719
when we primarily selling from you know

1524
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:43,600
the big

1525
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,920
elephant devices with with expensive

1526
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,000
hardware need to want to make a jump

1527
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,359
start for a new technology

1528
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,560
all right

1529
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,238
oh we have one more

1530
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,480
mic approach david lampotter so there is

1531
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,920
also chicken and egg with software

1532
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,400
implementations um speaking as someone

1533
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,679
who would do one of the software

1534
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,000
implementations we are stuck because the

1535
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,880
use cases from data centers and telcos

1536
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,760
in this

1537
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,719
and they want the hardware

1538
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,560
implementations and they don't see the

1539
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,679
point of start with the software

1540
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,159
implementations and there's like

1541
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,120
yeah

1542
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,080
so there is a joint session from babel

1543
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,040
monet and roll on um which with which

1544
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,360
are looking into multicast and so you

1545
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,000
know we've tried already to to discuss

1546
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,920
uh beer type

1547
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,679
beer itself or beer type technologies

1548
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,280
with role and then we just didn't have

1549
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,199
the time and critical mass and so on so

1550
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,280
maybe we can get more critical mass into

1551
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,360
that you know software space because i

1552
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,040
think there are a lot of use cases uh

1553
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,960
all around but yeah obviously people

1554
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,640
haven't worked enough

1555
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,480
these people here are mostly paid for by

1556
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,880
big boxes so for big service providers

1557
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,800
so we'll need to expand the community

1558
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,120
not me

1559
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,400
all right

1560
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,000
i am an independent contributor

1561
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,560
all right any other questions comments

1562
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,640
gripes

1563
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,679
fruit veggies

1564
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,120
is that we got one more we got one more

1565
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,760
hi this is uh ron enfeld the

1566
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,560
chair of the uh monet working group and

1567
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,159
the session that uh

1568
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,800
just mentioned this on friday morning

1569
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,360
first session okay friday

1570
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,880
and uh

1571
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,159
yeah my question is indeed

1572
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,920
these are

1573
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,719
mostly software-based routing solutions

1574
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,800
that we're looking at there and

1575
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
would be or be applicable

1576
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,880
there

1577
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,800
at least sandy is giving a presentation

1578
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,480
on how to uh

1579
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,440
to carry uh uh beer information in the

1580
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,600
label product

1581
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,560
but

1582
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,480
how this works on the boarding plane is

1583
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,960
not yet clear so i have to find that out

1584
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,400
before friday

1585
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,520
we're on it

1586
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,199
all right

1587
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,719
once twice

1588
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,040
thank you so much have a great week

1589
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,800
hello happy to be

1590
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,760
hello hello hello

1591
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,440
yes hello

1592
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,239
yes

1593
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,280
i just want to add some discussion

1594
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,719
for for for the

1595
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,880
because in china we had talked beer

1596
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,400
technology to operators years

1597
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,440
again

1598
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,600
years ago so

1599
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,800
i think that in china many operators

1600
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,920
know that beer is a very good technology

1601
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,159
and they want to use it

1602
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,080
but the another

1603
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,480
driven for the beer deployment is that

1604
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,800
how to use it for the application so

1605
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,239
we just uh we had talked the vr

1606
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,440
technology with the cdn and

1607
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,880
cdn

1608
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,760
content delivery

1609
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,159
so and some media

1610
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,440
uh delivery uh

1611
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,400
application to work with it so i think

1612
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,760
that maybe later um there can be used in

1613
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,719
china

1614
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,800
uh not very long yeah okay

1615
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,600
thank you sandy all right everybody uh

1616
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,719
congratulations you've already signed

1617
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,000
the blue sheets

1618
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,280
magic

1619
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,920
thank you very much have a great week

1620
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,400
masks on

1621
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,640
is you know 10-12 minutes to support

1622
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,440
good thing we had a short agenda

1623
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,159
ice

1624
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,000
ice is a hedge down

1625
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,280
what's that isis stuff here no no

1626
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,719
he's

1627
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:31,679
he actually

1628
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,120
jumped on the list

1629
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,800
like a month or so ago and had some

1630
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,920
input

1631
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,360
i was kind of surprised

1632
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,040
because he's pretty busy

1633
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,159
but i think from what i understand they

1634
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,640
may be coming out with some info like

1635
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,960
this summer so

1636
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,080
yeah we might hear what they're doing i

1637
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,000
mean it's pretty clear as nasty land

1638
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,520
play

1639
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,480
knowing the players but uh yeah what

1640
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,840
structure were we're really doing we'll

1641
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,159
find out

1642
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,719
all right all right yeah this is this

1643
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,120
has been fun you know it's been

1644
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,159
uh

1645
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,000
two years of remote i'm just kind of

1646
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,239
doing my own thing for a

1647
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,400
i remember this last night talking to

1648
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,679
smart people

1649
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,199
you know talking about heart problems

1650
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,919
like this is fun

1651
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,679
i enjoy what i'm doing in my own time as

1652
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,600
well but uh i need my head challenged

1653
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,560
yeah

1654
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,920
don't get that done too much by just

1655
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,920
building

1656
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,719
someone's afternoon

1657
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,480
you got lunch plans

1658
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,840
hey how are you doing good how are you

1659
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,400
i'm not too bad

1660
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,760
yes

1661
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,520
about two and a half hours without

1662
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,120
traffic so

1663
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,719
it's a nice little

1664
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,040
short drive and i grew up around here so

1665
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,000
it's

1666
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,600
good to get back

1667
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,440
my parents are

1668
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,519
20 minutes away in jersey so okay

1669
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,320
yes yes

1670
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,080
um

1671
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,400
i can tell you restaurants and wine yeah

1672
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,480
you know i don't know about beer yeah

1673
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,560
that's you know i'm not a big fan of

1674
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,400
american beer so i i can't give you good

1675
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,640
advice

1676
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,320
it's because you're living on old

1677
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,520
knowledge

1678
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,159
very old knowledge
