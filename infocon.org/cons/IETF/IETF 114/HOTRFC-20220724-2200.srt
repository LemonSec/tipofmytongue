41
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,400
stupidly

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
said stupidly um i did the thing that's

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,799
like oh i'm not going to be using my

44
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480

47
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,760
back in

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
i logged out and logged back in but i

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,920
did not restart my browser and stuff let

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,519
me let me do that

51
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,120
well hold on before we try that let's

52
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
just

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
let's see

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
yeah see this is what i'm getting

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
it's not it's not it's not refreshing

56
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120

57
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680

the audio like it shouldn't be doing

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
audio through here if it's

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759

me

111
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,799
if we would take a moment to do that

112

113
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120

119
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200

[Laughter]

130
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,959
i was trying to get logged in enough to

131
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,399
where i could just say meet echo and

132
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
make occurs

133
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
maybe in the next one

134
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
no no no no i'm still

135
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
we're still getting there yeah that's

136
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
not a problem it's uh

137
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
it doesn't

138
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
find you

139
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
yeah but

140
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
yes yes you're right

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
one of these days i'm going to have to

142
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
figure out how to clear that but it

143
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,839
doesn't need to be this way

144
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,079
um and so i'm going to

145
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
oh sorry there

146
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,680
right here

147
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
oh and this is actually working better

148
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,760
than i think it is

149
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
because

150
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,720
yeah

151
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
i'm actually looking

152
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
let's see

153
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
those are chair slides

154
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,000
okay i'm guessing that because that was

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
uploaded so very recently it's not in

156
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
here yet so you're gonna we're gonna try

157
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,320
something else okay

158
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
okay

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,680
um yes

160
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,839
okay

161
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,959
there should be a thing to upload

162
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,518
something manually

163
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
okay

164
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
okay

165
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
so

166
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,560
we'll figure this out another day

167
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
oh we probably screwed around

168
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
yeah

169
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,519
but but that could be for different

170
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
reasons

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
i think i have two different things

172
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,839
that are both called what are both

173
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
called chairs

174
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,600
so i actually need to be able to do

175
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
something

176
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,359

oh i do

245
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,400
uh so the ground rules hot rc is a

246
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,559
request for conversation

247
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,679
um

248
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,080
it's a good way to find a way find

249
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
people to talk to for various reasons

250
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
and we don't actually care what the

251
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,760
reasons are

252
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,000
each person who's going to be speaking

253
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,320
gets four minutes from go to please

254
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,640
applaud

255
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
at four minutes we start applauding

256
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
which looks like this

257
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,280
and the crowd goes well

258
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
so when you're speaking and you if you

259
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,440
if you happen to hear people applauding

260
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,159
uh that is your opportunity to recognize

261
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,400
what a great job you've done and passed

262
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
back the micro microphone to the next

263
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
speaker

264
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
uh we don't do questions after each talk

265
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
here that basically the thing with hot

266
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,000
rfc is that this is where you

267
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,799
come and you provide follow-up

268
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
so basically saying what you

269
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,120
want people to do and how you want them

270
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
to find you to do it

271
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,879
is part of each talk

272
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
to

273
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
follow along we're going to be using the

274
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,120
data tracker for all slides

275
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,080
so we will let the conv the we will let

276
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
the

277
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,799
conversations begin

278
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
and um

279
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
first speaker we have

280
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
will be tourists

281
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
who will be talking about what has the

282
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,039
ietf ever done for energy

283
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,320
give me a second to get slides up and to

284
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,120
start a clock

285
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
and i'm removing the mask because my

286
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
accent is worse enough already i hope

287
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
that's

288
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,679
fine still louder okay

289
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,720
all right

290
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
people on the back falling over okay

291
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
yeah i'm i hope it's okay to remove the

292
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
mask while i'm here on the microphone

293
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
because my accent is already bad enough

294
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
and i don't need a microphone to make it

295
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
worse and maybe if we can get the levels

296
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
up that would help people to really not

297
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
eat the mic not sure if the technician

298
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
is still here while spencer is still

299
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,039

300
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,918

all right welcome everybody um

324
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,080
so we we started to think about um

325
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
what might be interesting to do about

326
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
energy green networking sustainability

327
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,720
and so on and then you step back and say

328
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
well you know what is already been done

329
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
in the ietf and

330
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,880
um when we started to write this

331
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
together it actually went through a lot

332
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
of different areas

333
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
um which reminded me of really

334
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
the monty python the life of brian right

335
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,240
so

336
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
what have the romans ever done for us

337
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
and you know you start with oh yeah the

338
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,799
itf that's just lln uh low power

339
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
networks iot that's all it's energy

340
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,159
related and when you then go through um

341
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
what diet have and i think it's a lot

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
more um so

343
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,240
the purpose of the document is uh to

344
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
become maybe an um

345
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
individual submission document for um

346
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,559
education of the community and to help

347
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,480
um you know steer interest in new work

348
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,679
but also

349
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,919
to broaden the adoption of the specific

350
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,200
technologies mentioned now um i'll i'll

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,440
just uh you know show you here the um

352
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,520
the content of the document a lot what i

353
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,640
think

354
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
really helps preserve energy from the

355
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
iatf work is really incidental meaning

356
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
all the technologies we've done to some

357
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,320
extent

358
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
do save energy compared to their prior

359
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,720
non-digitized

360
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
solutions um and then the other part

361
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,559
that really made the um

362
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,200
itf technologies become very energy

363
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
saving is the the saving through scale

364
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
right building the internet converging

365
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
all these different separate network

366
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
applications into one network so those

367
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,120
things are

368
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
big areas in the document

369
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,679
and then looking into specific

370
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
applications like telecollaboration

371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
computing with sustainable energy so

372
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,919
there are really specific areas i think

373
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,400
of interest obviously i hope i'm missing

374
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,320
a big area some people will jump up and

375
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
say you know we can contribute other

376
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
stuff that incidentally relates to

377
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,559
energy saving as well then the obvious

378
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,120
one low power lossy constraint networks

379
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,799
we've got you know

380
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,240
almost an area worth of um

381
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
working groups um that are working on

382
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,559
various technologies and then there are

383
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,600
some

384
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
you know sample technologies where you

385
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
know i just had some background and

386
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,760
interest in but hopefully there will

387
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,720
others uh be added to it um and then of

388
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,799
course the specific networks being built

389
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,960
to actually support the generation of

390
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
power um smart grid synchro phaser

391
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
networks um that's in the totally

392
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,279
different approach and then energy

393
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
management we had an e-man working group

394
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,679
and later on there were ideas to do

395
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,000
power awareness in networks but

396
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
they didn't pan out so far to form

397
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,919
working groups but there are some good

398
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
initial drafts next slide

399
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,000
so yeah

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,880
so this document just to repeat

401
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,480
if you're interested please read it

402
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,640
provide feedback if you're interested to

403
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,919
contribute please contact the authors

404
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
it would be great if this could become a

405
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,399
community effort of the different areas

406
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,399
of interest

407
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,640
and maybe there is a

408
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
strange old mailing list that might also

409
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
be be used to discuss these things

410
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,720
sounds like a

411
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,159
recipe for possible collaboration

412
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,440
and yeah that's it

413
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
thank you very much

414
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,170
[Applause]

415
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,720
excellent

416
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
um

417
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
let's see

418
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,399
our next our next speaker should be

419
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
alexander

420
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
excellent okay and let me get your

421
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,760
slides into the right place

422
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,520
[Music]

423
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
great

424
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,679
am i in the right place

425
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
does it show okay it doesn't show here

426
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,200
okay well

427
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,799
okay so um yeah so um

428
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,480
welcome everyone so basically this

429
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
presentation is briefly to build on what

430
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,600
charles was just presented presenting on

431
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
challenges and opportunities in green

432
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,440
networking and there are two drafts

433
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,039
actually which this presentation relates

434
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
to please next slide

435
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,320
i just have a

436
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,879
oopsie

437
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,360
there should be two slides after this no

438
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,320
no i mean

439
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,919
they are i'm just getting an unstable

440
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
connection with the server

441
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,158
um

442
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,640
let me

443
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
yeah i just got i just got server

444
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
unreachable let me connect to somebody

445
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,760
let me connect to another device

446
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,679
interesting

447
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
okay

448
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,799
wow

449
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,159
is

450
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,840
my apologies

451
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,360
okay great

452
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
yes so so really this concerns two

453
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
drafts one problem statement and uh

454
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,480
with challenges and opportunities in

455
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,320
green networking and one basically

456
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,080
addressing one of starting leaders one

457
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
of the challenges namely the metrics of

458
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,000
the instrumentation um next slide please

459
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
okay so basically um yeah this builds a

460
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
little bit also on what charles was

461
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,640
presenting earlier so the question is

462
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,000
why green networking or why

463
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,320
sustainability actually and obviously

464
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,919
this is one of mankind's grand

465
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,120
challenges

466
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,559
and the question is basically well while

467
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
network applications themselves are key

468
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,320
enabler of course the sun sustainability

469
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
what about the networks themselves and

470
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,279
clearly the net zero mandates etc will

471
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,519
apply to the network providers as well

472
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,279
sorry we lost connectivity again

473
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,440
how do we get that

474
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
i am getting

475
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,440
so

476
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,760
i am getting an unreliable connection to

477
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,960
the server after switching to my my uh

478
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
phone as a hotspot

479
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,440
so

480
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,679
i'm curious

481
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
wait we seem to we we seem to be coming

482
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,840
back to life here

483
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
okay

484
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,520
um

485
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,520
all right

486
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,680
so let's go let's see maybe three times

487
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
the charm

488
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
so

489
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,520
um

490
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,160
okay so so uh anyway so so the question

491
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
is what boils down to this is uh the

492
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
question is also how can and how can the

493
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
network itself

494
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
contribute to that and how what are ways

495
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,920
in which the itf and the network at the

496
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
network level

497
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,240
how we can contribute to making networks

498
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
more sustainable um and this may be

499
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,320
perfectly a smaller factor than general

500
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
hardware advances and deployment factors

501
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,720
and antenna technology but still of

502
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,760
course there are certain things which

503
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,880
are within our

504
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,960
control next one next slide please

505
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
okay and so there are

506
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,320
um quite a few opportunities and of

507
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,040
course challenges associated with them

508
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
we divided them into

509
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
four different uh yeah into four

510
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,119
different levels basically one for one

511
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,359
basically going bottom up at the device

512
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,520
or at the equipment level it starts with

513
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,359
providing proper instrumentation and

514
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,040
visibility into the right types of

515
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,960
metrics um

516
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
which because unless you have visibility

517
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
to this uh all the other well then

518
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,280
basically it's kind of like future

519
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
what else you're attempting to to do

520
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,880
this is kind of like our starting point

521
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
there but of course it shouldn't end

522
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
there there are things that you could do

523
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,800
at the protocol level and basically a

524
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,119
wide wide range of things anything from

525
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,400
basic traffic

526
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
adaptation to leads to traffic

527
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,880
characteristics which are more energy

528
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,240
friend friendly if you will to

529
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,320
enabling other mechanisms such as for

530
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,400
ins fast discovery for state

531
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
reconvergence if you for instance

532
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,240
dynamically

533
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
take resources in and out of service for

534
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,359
instance um

535
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
network addressing to have smaller

536
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
tables to maintain et cetera et cetera

537
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,280
at the network level there is a question

538
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
of can we do more energy where routing

539
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,880
path configuration takes energy and

540
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,200
sustainability into account what would

541
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
be some of the control protocol

542
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
extension that would make sense there

543
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,599
and then find basically also at the

544
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,200
architecture level one can look at some

545
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,520
of those things as well basically when

546
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
it comes to where do we place content

547
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
where do we place computation of course

548
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,200
people are already looking into this but

549
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,720
not so much with the energy or

550
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
sustainability in the foreground but

551
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
certainly an aspect that that plays a

552
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,359
role there as well

553
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,960
and so there are many pieces and support

554
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,040
that can contribute to this

555
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,440
not one brand solution is required next

556
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,839
next slide

557
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,800
please and uh so basically we want to

558
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,200
generate basically more uh discussion on

559
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
this and so we have posted two drafts on

560
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,520
this topic and would appreciate uh

561
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,599
feedback comments on this there's a

562
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,960
problem statement and then basically

563
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
metrics is the first specific work item

564
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
and we are also still looking for

565
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
collaborators and actually the proper

566
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
landing spot here here in the idf

567
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
between the authors we will have an

568
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,839
informal site meeting on tuesday

569
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,640
from 1 to 2 in salon 9. if you are

570
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,200

oh

579
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,520
yes hi spencer i'm online though

580
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
oh okay

581
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
excellent but let me let me let me

582
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,680
uh

583
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
let me get back here and get organized

584
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
and i will i will

585
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,280
share your slides

586
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,240
there you go

587
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,599
there you go

588
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,280
okay sophia

589
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,119
yes should i go

590
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,040
yes please please please start i am

591
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
starting your clock

592
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,000
okay thank you

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,720
so hi everyone uh so today i wanted to

594
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,920
talk about the challenges and

595
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,839
opportunity of postgraduate cryptography

596
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,079
and that was a critical uh nexus live

597
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,040
please my name is sophia

598
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,839
next is like this

599
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
so basically why should we talk about

600
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,400
this so as many of you might might have

601
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,720
heard nist run a process to actually

602
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,560
select new plus quantum algorithms

603
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,440
mainly algorithms that are safe in the

604
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
interface of the thread of quantum

605
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
computers and right now this process

606
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,560
have actually reached its very first

607
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
milestone actually this month and they

608
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
decided to actually announce the

609
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,240
selected algorithms that are going to be

610
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,760
standardized for the key exchange

611
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,440
process meaning that that's the process

612
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,760
in which you generate a key and you also

613
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
share that team with a participant to

614
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
arrive to arrive to confidentiality and

615
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,160
also this they decided to standardize

616
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
the algorithms for authentication mainly

617
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
digital signatures this is just the

618
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,760
first milestone they are going to run

619
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,599
the next competition for more digital

620
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,760
signatures and also for a fourth run but

621
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,520
they indeed reached the first milestone

622
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,440
meaning soon we were going to be having

623
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,599
a standardized quantum algorithms from

624
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,520
the uh basically from the next

625
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
institution next slide please

626
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
so why is this important for the itf

627
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,800
because one of the things that one might

628
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
think is to just take the pos quantum

629
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
algorithm the signature algorithm for

630
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,400
example and swap it

631
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
in the place where a classic algorithm

632
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,960
might have been this is not so simple

633
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,319
because all of the post quantum

634
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,280
algorithms in in specific the signature

635
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,839
algorithms have bigger uh parameter

636
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,680
sizes when compared with the classical

637
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
counterparts here just put a simple

638
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,400
list actually compare with some

639
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
classical algorithms and when they

640
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
actually are not bigger in size uh they

641
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
do have also bigger computational times

642
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
in their signing or verification times

643
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,079
nexus like please

644
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
okay so as i said that's already a

645
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,839
trader because you will have bigger

646
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
sizes you will have bigger computational

647
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,440
times and that in turn means that maybe

648
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,400
we will be adding latency um or increase

649
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,560
uh increased times to the connections

650
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,160
that we have which means that the

651
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
network and protocols that we're using

652
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
are going to be affected and also an

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,400
important point is that right now the

654
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,560
majority of protocols that we use being

655
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,040
a tls or

656
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,200
wireguard or signal are mainly addicted

657
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
to diffie-hellman properties and the

658
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
majority of those quantum algorithms

659
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,160
don't have all of the difficult

660
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,400
properties that we love and also certain

661
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,079
algorithms are now currently being

662
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,160
standardized by the iita for example in

663
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
the ppm group don't really have a

664
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,319
postquantum counterpart that can be

665
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,319
attested for a high security just like

666
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,560
for example syrian united states

667
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,400
threshold signatures to have past

668
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,720
quantum alternatives but they have not

669
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
been properly assessed for their

670
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,000
security excess life please

671
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
okay maybe

672
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,680
there you go okay thank you um

673
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,000
well this is very important as i said

674
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,760
it's something that we should start

675
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
thinking about experimentation to see

676
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,280
how much we can indeed add dispersed

677
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
quantum algorithms or if we cannot add

678
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
it what kind of alternatives do we have

679
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,760
and this in turn means that maybe we

680
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,880
should build these science that are

681
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
generic for post quantum algorithms but

682
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,720
also for other things and this also in

683
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,880
turns means that maybe the way uh that

684
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,480
the protocols right now working could

685
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,400
potentially be changed to not only

686
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,480
include quantum algorithms but also all

687
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
the uh things that are needed if you're

688
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
ever interested interested we're running

689
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,720
a workshop on this specific challenge of

690
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,640
putting quantum cryptography network and

691
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
protocols it is going to be potentially

692
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,520
collocated with the niss workshop on

693
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,359
november so please reach out if you're

694
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,440
interested in participating to it and

695
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,760
there's also currently a new itf mainly

696
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,240
spqc that you can join and continue the

697
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,839
discussion next is like

698
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,970
and with that thank you very much

699
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:26,069
[Applause]

700
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,079
so

701
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,560
next person on the agenda is i believe

702
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,560
pascal

703
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,040
and

704
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
yeah

705
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,480
okay

706
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,880
so we go

707
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,920
go

708
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,599
go

709
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,280
so this talk is about internet of

710
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,359
security and it's a call to research and

711
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,880
collaboration and next slide please

712
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
so to introduce the issue to learn about

713
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
secure emails are small chip using one

714
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,720
card and sim module electronic passport

715
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,839
with a height security level lighter

716
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,079
security level in the market

717
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,359
there are

718
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,160
today many eight uh

719
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,200
small eight to 16 cpu with 10 kilobyte

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,319
sram and 100 kilobyte of non-relative

721
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,680
memory

722
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,839
there's new generation with about 2

723
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,560
megabyte flash and 64 kilobytes

724
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,319
sram and they include a crypto processor

725
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,599
they use a

726
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,760
legacy communication which is based on

727
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
serial and iso 7816 protocol

728
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,480
but

729
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,680
emerging support a2c and spi

730
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,440
there have been a reincarnate rules for

731
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
a packet

732
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,119
up to

733
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,680
256 bytes the programming environment

734
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,599
like java card 6 billion device

735
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,359
deploy every day 6 billion java cards

736
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,040
and

737
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,280
there are secure software manager but

738
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440
something's called global platform in

739
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,480
order to

740
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,119
list the letter upload the software next

741
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,760
slide please

742
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,680
so while connecting secure element to

743
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
internet

744
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,200
it's very simple

745
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,280
we want online cryptographic resource

746
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
for internet users

747
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,520
and we want to identify this resources

748
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,640
by a

749
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,280
uniform resource identifier

750
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,760
the issue there is no tpip stack in

751
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
secure elements so we need additional

752
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,240
processors to manage the networks we

753
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,160
need to support global platform for

754
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,400
on-demand protocols we need the defined

755
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,839
protocol to access secure element

756
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,280
resources

757
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,359
we need we need to define ticker element

758
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,839
naming and we need to define attestation

759
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,640
procedures for on-demand

760
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
application

761
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,170
for next slide please

762
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,960
[Music]

763
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,240
so that

764
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,359
mine is a free atf draft in order to to

765
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,720
support this

766
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,880
one is called rox it's an old draft and

767
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,520
this graph is enabled to support a

768
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,839
global platform over tlx

769
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,760
the second one is called the second

770
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
draft is called tlssc for tls for secure

771
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,880
element

772
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,599
it supports a tls ps key in a secure

773
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,640
element

774
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,280
and this gives a tls interface to secure

775
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,880
element

776
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,079
we choose a

777
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,040
telescope name for

778
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,119
uniform or source identifiers

779
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,880
and the third draft is a citation

780
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,079
procedures and it's it's in the internet

781
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,000
of secure element ioc draft

782
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,280
and

783
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,620
next slide please

784
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,240
[Music]

785
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,760
so at this moment there are open

786
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,960
software

787
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,520
one is tls sc for java card it works

788
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,640
with java card 3.04

789
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,520
it's available in github

790
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,640
and

791
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,839
the second

792
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,839
open software

793
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,680
version 5 which works with windows

794
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,800
ubuntu

795
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,480
and raspberry pi

796
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,720
and it is an implementation of racks and

797
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,640
tls from server

798
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,800
and it supports a multiple communication

799
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,440
interface like pcic i2 sim

800
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,839
and sim array

801
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,839
and that's it i'm done

802
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,419
[Music]

803
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,720
thank you

804
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,960
thank you and um

805
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,200
our next speaker will be hannes who is

806
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,280
talking about attestation within uh tls

807
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,079
and i will find hannes's slides real

808
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,079
quick

809
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,000
thank you guys

810
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,800
um

811
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
as mentioned i want to talk about the

812
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,040
new effort or new investigation we have

813
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,240
been doing on

814
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,720
using at the station in dls next slide

815
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,640
spencer

816
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,599
and

817
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,440
as a short problem statement on why we

818
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,040
are doing this

819
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,640
i'm sure you've followed you've been

820
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,599
following the work on at the station and

821
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,760
in the iedf and the rats working group

822
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
and some of the iot work where we are

823
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,599
trying to define

824
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,559
mechanisms to enroll iot devices into

825
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,400
cloud-based services and they typically

826
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,760
want to see

827
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,599
all sorts of information about whether

828
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,960
the device is genuine whether it has

829
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,240
been cloned

830
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,040
um

831
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
what type of configuration it's using

832
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,280
during boot what software it's running

833
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,359
on etc and all of this is covered in in

834
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,800
rats with these entity at the

835
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
attestation token and other similar

836
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,599
mechanisms

837
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,599
and then at the end of the dance once

838
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,680
the device is authorized

839
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,000
it actually typically establishes a

840
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,680
secure communication channel with the

841
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,119
cloud-based service and so next slide um

842
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,760
it was kind of obvious to combine the

843
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,240
two steps of attestation with dls

844
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,359
and that's what we have been doing in in

845
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,359
a recently published document and also

846
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,359
software we've been working on

847
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,160
the

848
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
solution is simple to augment the dls

849
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,640
exchange with um the attestation

850
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,960
information and to provide a uh proof of

851
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,319
procession

852
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,440
um

853
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
the software we are working on which

854
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,480
will hopefully

855
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,880
uh will be able to release shortly uses

856
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,480
a combination of the

857
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,880
embed dls with dls 1.3

858
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,839
um

859
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,280
a platform agnostic uh library to access

860
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,640
security hardware called basic

861
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,440
and

862
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,920
on the cloud side there is a

863
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,319
verification services service we need to

864
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,599
use uh

865
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,040
which

866
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,640
colleagues of mine have been working on

867
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,200
called verizon and we basically munch

868
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
all these uh three components together

869
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,640
to

870
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,920
accomplish a workable system

871
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,079
next slide

872
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,240
and here here's the document and uh

873
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,680
pointer to

874
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
the projects we're using and uh soon you

875
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,240
will also see the

876
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,200
sort of this poc essentially or the

877
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,640
stack

878
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,319
and if someone is interested in the

879
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,520
details or

880
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,920
wants to collaborate or has similar

881
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,240
type of attestation systems uh come and

882
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,680
talk to me

883
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,200
thank you thank you

884
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,239
[Applause]

885
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,480
next speaker is uh lynn hahn

886
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,119
who will be talking about

887
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,599
the leo satellite networking these

888
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,520
flying infrastructure for future

889
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,280
internet uh let me find your slides

890
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,280
hello everyone my talk is a aerial

891
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,079
satellite networking

892
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:55,200
infrastructure for future internet

893
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,200
this is a pretty big topic i don't think

894
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,119
five four minutes is enough but i've

895
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,040
tried to do my best to

896
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
give most important information next

897
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,440
slice

898
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,119
uh lu satellites is a

899
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,319
most key components in the future

900
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,920
non-terrestrial network integration

901
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
because it can provide the

902
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,240
shorter latency and higher bandwidth

903
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,119
compared with other satellites or other

904
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,160
space

905
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,000
networking technology

906
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and it can provide global coverage

907
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,240
next slides

908
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,319
uh

909
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,119
why are your slices so special because

910
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,079
it's a

911
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,119
moment it's moving so fast

912
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,760
unfortunately this is originally a ppt

913
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,400
has some video clip if you're interested

914
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,240
i can

915
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
give you you can shoot me email

916
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,200
first is that 50 satellites moving to

917
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,079
different directions another 50 percent

918
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,079
this uh this will cause the satellite

919
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,480
networking becoming our interleaved mesh

920
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,480
network and moving at a very high speed

921
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,880
also including the self-rotation of

922
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,680
earth makes the

923
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,720
movement is even more complicated second

924
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
issue is that the link between satellite

925
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,119
and ground station will keep flipping

926
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,440
about five minutes

927
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,720
and

928
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,480
the distance between satellite and the

929
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,640
ground also keep changing

930
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,760
and

931
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,119
also the

932
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,640
compilation is a point-to-mod point

933
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,880
and the huge number of satellite ground

934
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,599
station link could be more than million

935
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,800
links

936
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,839
last problem is that

937
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,200
is a distance between adjacent

938
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,839
satellites is keep changing and also

939
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,200
those

940
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,839
links will be uh swapping the direction

941
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,440
at the polar area

942
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,079
next slides

943
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,440
so itf has done a lot of work uh for

944
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,839
many years uh for satellites but

945
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,880
unfortunately uh uh most of our work are

946
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
focusing other layers for example we

947
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,640
have done a

948
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,839
dtn

949
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,400
it's not fitting to air you

950
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,280
and we have done air for works which is

951
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,240
about transport quotation layer and we

952
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,200
have done the coding for the satellites

953
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,920
even we had the satcom side meeting in

954
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,400
the old itf

955
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,800
recently we have many

956
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,520
satellite-related draft come up

957
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,720
but

958
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,440
long existing home for those

959
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,119
drafts

960
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,720
the first question we have to answer is

961
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,359
that is the ip networkings needed for

962
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,599
air u because many people challenge me

963
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,000
say starling doesn't use it that's true

964
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,960
but

965
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,520
we have many reasons to to to predict

966
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,240
that the l3 technology is still best for

967
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,480
the aerial satellite firstly the

968
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,839
scalability

969
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,480
second is the interworking with internet

970
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,960
and the third one is that 3gpp has

971
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,200
already expected that

972
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,799
the satellite network is ip network

973
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,960
i have more material at the back of the

974
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,880
slides you can read it

975
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,760
then

976
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,280
we we have to figure out what is the

977
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,119
problem for the current ip technology

978
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,799
actually there are many problems from

979
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,040
addressing to routing uh to traffic

980
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,960
engineering and the multi-pass and even

981
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,040
mobility

982
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,799
we may need to

983
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,720
reinvestigate and

984
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,280
enhance it

985
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,920
next slides

986
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,640
so what's next we plan to have a side

987
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,280
meeting in next ietf not this itf next

988
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,000
itf so if you're interested just reach

989
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,839
me and

990
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,599
if you want to contribute or present

991
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,280
something in the science meeting just

992
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,090
let me know thank you

993
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:53,869
[Applause]

994
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,760
phil

995
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,240
this this this is you this is you let me

996
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
bring you up your slides

997
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,160
okay well while he's bringing up the

998
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,400
flashlight i'd like to really thank all

999
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,960
the webrtc folk

1000
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,720
if it wasn't for the work that you'd

1001
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,839
done

1002
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,050
the pandemic would have gone a lot worse

1003
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:23,679
[Applause]

1004
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,119
that said

1005
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,920
next slide please

1006
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,359
if you look at the state of webrtc today

1007
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,599
this is what users are seeing

1008
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,640
all that open standards based goodness

1009
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,440
is hidden behind a proprietary walled

1010
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,079
garden next

1011
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,760
what next likely what users need is the

1012
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,160
ability to communicate with any other

1013
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,920
user no matter which service provider is

1014
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,920
providing their webrtc contact

1015
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,880
and

1016
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,040
they should not just be able to choose a

1017
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,359
messaging provider and talk to everybody

1018
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,040
they should be able to change their

1019
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,960
messaging provider at any time without

1020
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
switching costs

1021
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,760
i'm a person i am not your business

1022
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,839
model

1023
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,079
we need messaging address portability

1024
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,880
oh and telephone numbers

1025
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,079
who on earth thought of using telephone

1026
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,480
numbers for messaging on the internet

1027
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,880
next slide

1028
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,440
oh and yes be nice to have some security

1029
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,040
not least because

1030
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,079
um

1031
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,000
you know the potential sponsor i've got

1032
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,920
wants some security and i'm security guy

1033
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,079
next slide please

1034
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,160
the problem i see in the current

1035
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,400
end-to-end messaging model

1036
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,160
is that all we get

1037
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,760
is end to end security we think about

1038
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,839
securing the packets as they're going

1039
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,079
from the sender to the receiver

1040
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,880
but that doesn't close down

1041
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,520
all the points of vulnerability where a

1042
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,440
hostile government can do something

1043
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,559
hostile next slide

1044
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,240
the problem is that unless you control

1045
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,920
your own contacts directory so that you

1046
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
control the knowledge of the public key

1047
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,839
of the other party that's a place where

1048
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,599
a warrant can be

1049
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,359
imposed to redirect calls to another

1050
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,559
endpoint

1051
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,799
so you've still got end-to-end security

1052
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
you're just going to the wrong end point

1053
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,240
and the applications are another point

1054
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,640
if you've got a soul vendor system in a

1055
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,000
world garden

1056
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,559
the uh a government can and does and has

1057
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,480
go to a vendor and say you're going to

1058
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,640
put a back door in or we're going to

1059
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,760
shut you down next slide please

1060
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,400
okay so how do we fix it well the first

1061
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,079
thing we need to do is to complete the

1062
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,240
messaging stack and i've been looking at

1063
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,119
webrtc and you know i've got this

1064
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,280
threshold key infrastructure that

1065
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,559
manages

1066
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,480
public and private keys people

1067
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,520
across devices and makes it really easy

1068
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,480
for the end user is transparent security

1069
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,319
so what i want to do is to take my

1070
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,160
security stuff my tki and bolt it on top

1071
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,319
of webrtc

1072
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,480
the user will control the contacts

1073
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,520
catalog

1074
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,799
so that cannot be tampered with and the

1075
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,280
user because it will all be an open

1076
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,880
specification

1077
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,559
the user can choose

1078
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,480
hopefully between multiple application

1079
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,599
providers not just my uh

1080
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:36,960
prototype

1081
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,640
and that removes a single point of

1082
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,119
failure next slide

1083
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,799
okay so why

1084
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,680
i'm going to be here till friday uh if

1085
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,079
you're interested in uh this type of

1086
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,400
project uh please talk to me

1087
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,200
uh

1088
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,040
you know tell me

1089
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,240
i'm not a webrtc person i can see how to

1090
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,119
do it

1091
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,680
i've kind of sort of got my prototype

1092
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,160
running and i'll be uh hopefully running

1093
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,040
that prototype by london

1094
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,520
but i would really appreciate help on

1095
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,760
choosing the best pass

1096
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,799
path through webrtc and the best of

1097
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,799
breed things to

1098
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,880
go to market with so

1099
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
thank you for your time and uh

1100
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,960
mathmesh.com has the further details

1101
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,190
thank you

1102
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:29,040
[Applause]

1103
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,720
so next speaker is uh legion dawn

1104
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,319
who's talking about challenges and

1105
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:38,079
operations and control networks

1106
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,559
i will find your slides

1107
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,309
[Music]

1108
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,920
hi my name is lee jindong i'm going to

1109
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,720
present unless operations and control

1110
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,319
networks

1111
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,240
through this presentation i mainly want

1112
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,319
to call for your participation in the

1113
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,960
site meeting we're going to host on ocn

1114
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,040
tomorrow lunchtime

1115
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,680
next slide

1116
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,440
as you know automation grows and becomes

1117
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,880
more dynamic

1118
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,359
the factory floors will require more

1119
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,680
sophisticated controllers with more

1120
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,200
processing time

1121
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,160
more processing capabilities

1122
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,680
more flexibility and more

1123
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,760
interoperability

1124
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,400
as support and the controllers sitting

1125
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,480
in the cloud

1126
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,520
such as virtualized prcs

1127
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,319
would

1128
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,880
become more and more popular

1129
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,680
as another use case in remote driving um

1130
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,119
a remote

1131
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,520
human driver actually controls or

1132
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,520
operates a vehicle from a distance

1133
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,920
through communication networks

1134
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,119
and remote driving is extremely useful

1135
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,359
when autonomous driving becomes

1136
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,240
you know short or for short and in some

1137
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,799
hazardous environments where human

1138
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,160
cannot access

1139
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,680
so such um factory automation or remote

1140
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,960
driving use cases do require network to

1141
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,839
guarantee the latent end-to-end latency

1142
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,960
and also need to identify what are the

1143
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,000
urgent uh most urgent packets and treat

1144
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,720
them with some more priority and

1145
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,799
algorithm being dropped during

1146
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,240
transmission um so those different

1147
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,039
vertical like indus verticals do share

1148
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,640
some common operation of behavioral

1149
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,520
operations in control systems so there

1150
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,839
is a controller which interfaces with

1151
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,240
the sensors to collect data and then

1152
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,400
interfaces with the accurate or to send

1153
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,920
a command

1154
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,440
but if those end devices are networked

1155
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,000
there would some would have some issues

1156
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,039
so

1157
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,400
um those common elements or abstract

1158
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,440
elements

1159
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,359
by using ocn actually enable us to

1160
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,680
have discussions on those requirements

1161
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,799
and the issues next slide please

1162
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,920
so we define our thing as operation uh

1163
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,920
like it's a short name for operation

1164
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,839
control network it's a interconnection

1165
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,839
of a few devices

1166
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,000
and their controllers for the exchange

1167
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,240
of data to cause and monitor change to

1168
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,039
the

1169
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,880
end equipment next slide please

1170
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,599
so what are the issues we want to

1171
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,319
consider in ocn um so with the

1172
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,760
controllers

1173
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,920
being sitting in the cloud and there are

1174
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,119
more and more

1175
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,520
field devices being deployed maybe it is

1176
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,079
time to explore the opportunities and

1177
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,520
methods to use iep to interconnect the

1178
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,039
controllers and

1179
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,920
field devices and to build ocn and high

1180
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,599
precision communication are needed

1181
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,680
because you want to guarantee the key

1182
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,200
performances

1183
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,079
and to provide a more granular

1184
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,599
qs to build ocn and you know there are

1185
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,280
multiple types of

1186
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,119
you know like a

1187
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,039
media such as you know 5g radio

1188
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,000
internet you know all those kind of

1189
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,160
different

1190
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,400
media and as well as there are multiple

1191
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,839
types of field bus communication

1192
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:28,079
protocols we want to use o7 to convert

1193
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,079
them in a large scale

1194
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,160
with some reference model

1195
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,640
and then addressing needs to be

1196
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,799
supported like you know auto

1197
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,280
configuration and also header region is

1198
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,480
addressing

1199
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,039
um and we also need to

1200
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,520
build message types um

1201
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,000
for example what are common

1202
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,079
characteristics between the controllers

1203
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,400
and field devices

1204
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,599
and the last but not least is the

1205
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,640
security you know we want to ensure the

1206
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,799
security of communication

1207
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,400
uh between the field devices and the

1208
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,240
controllers um

1209
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,799
and next slide please

1210
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:09,200
all right uh so we are going to host a

1211
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,960
list of meetings always saying tomorrow

1212
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,280
lunchtime uh in room

1213
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,039
actually this is wrong slide we are

1214
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,010
going to host site meeting

1215
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,880
[Applause]

1216
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,839
horizon at a rooftop level okay and this

1217
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,599
is the website oh web link we can share

1218
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,760
and

1219
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,240
i guess i did a better job

1220
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,200
now

1221
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,160
yeah

1222
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,920
most importantly come to the side

1223
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,240
meeting

1224
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,160
i was i was i was just going to let her

1225
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,520
put up the

1226
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,359
sound check slide where the media gets

1227
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,079
next next speaker is uh arnaud who is

1228
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,359
talking about enterprises and

1229
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,599
organizations needing help from

1230
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,240
ech work on how to organize their

1231
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,799
operational security

1232
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,799
and

1233
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,359
you

1234
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,960
yes absolutely

1235
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,119
we can hear you we can hear you fine and

1236
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,480
uh let me find your slides

1237
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,078
thank you spencer

1238
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,640
so good uh

1239
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,160
good evening i guess for you guys

1240
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,440
and sorry for my voice i have a bad

1241
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,000
coved so

1242
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,160
hopefully not go too much

1243
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,400
all right so this is um

1244
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,240
we prepared the paper

1245
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,680
on ech for enterprises uh it's not a

1246
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,599
critic of ech we are trying to look

1247
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,039
beyond

1248
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,280
and the situation is pretty simple

1249
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,880
enterprises are facing a set of

1250
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,720
requirements and constraints uh

1251
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,280
compliancy race threat landscape and

1252
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,079
since 30 years they evolved the defense

1253
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,720
on operational security from

1254
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,160
the old x dot 800 to zero trust to sse

1255
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,079
to mesh etc

1256
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,640
and they need to the require the need

1257
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,240
for network security controls and

1258
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,599
selective decrypt for example with uh

1259
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,359
for that loss prevention

1260
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,799
so if we remove the access to the sni

1261
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,920
ech is pushing security to the end point

1262
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,079
now unfortunately in the paper we show

1263
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,960
we can not trust the device and not

1264
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,200
trust the brother we found enough

1265
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,160
evidence of money in the browser attacks

1266
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,119
and worse if you really want to protect

1267
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,359
the people you not only need to access

1268
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,520
the smi but you need to read the entire

1269
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,440
the entire page that's the only way to

1270
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,880
detect the attack

1271
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,960
so the browser cannot be judge and party

1272
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,480
which means how we're going to do

1273
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,920
security

1274
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,400
so or perhaps ech is pushing the

1275
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,920
security model that goes in the

1276
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,160
cloud-facing server so that would make

1277
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,559
the confessing server a middle box

1278
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,720
is it an opportunity actually to find a

1279
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,640
solution between the different parties

1280
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,160
and that's really the question we are

1281
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,759
trying to address next slide

1282
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,359
so it's pretty simple

1283
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,079
we need first clarification on the

1284
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,839
client-facing server so the back-end

1285
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:12,799
server

1286
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,200
is it really left to just implementation

1287
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,920
or do we need the protocol

1288
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,000
based for the client-facing server to

1289
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,920
the back-end server and in this case we

1290
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,399
are back-to-middle box problem

1291
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,600
if ech constitutes cannot be judging

1292
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,439
parties how do we integrate a

1293
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,679
third-party security component

1294
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,000
and is there a form of recognition like

1295
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,399
management of of enterprise or personal

1296
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,759
security problems both answers

1297
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,839
can happen and they will lead to

1298
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,839
different development so if you are

1299
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,520
interested to find a way forward here

1300
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,679
please join in fact i made a mistake

1301
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,279
it's not 1 30 pm it will be noon 30

1302
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,238
pm

1303
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,719
on tuesday and you can contact me

1304
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,198
thank you

1305
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,960
[Applause]

1306
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,439
thank you

1307
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,919
and

1308
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,000
our next speaker is uh gusama who is

1309
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,198
talking about

1310
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,080
a data driven approach to tackle network

1311
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,279
diversity with heterogeneous protocol

1312
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,279
configurations

1313
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,679
and let me find the

1314
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,560
let me let me find your slides

1315
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,719
hi spencer

1316
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,399
so yeah all right uh i am a graduate

1317
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,158
student at brown university and today i

1318
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:55,600
wanted to share some vicious work with

1319
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,360
the broader iedf community to see if

1320
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,360
everyone's anyone is interested

1321
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,480
so uh next slide please

1322
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,159
so websites typically use cdns uh to

1323
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,000
deliver their content efficiently to the

1324
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,040
end users

1325
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,040
and they have this cluster of servers

1326
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,440
spread across across the globe uh

1327
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,520
typically called cd in edge and at the

1328
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,159
edge we have protocols like tcp and http

1329
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:21,120
that dictate the data transmission rules

1330
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,280
so there's multiple options available we

1331
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,199
have multiple types of http and

1332
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,640
different http configuration and

1333
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,640
similarly for tcp we have

1334
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,120
different congestion controls like bbr

1335
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,360
cubic reno and multiple other options

1336
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,440
such as congestion windows

1337
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,520
and it's the job of operator to select

1338
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,360
the configuration that are expected to

1339
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,199
maximize the performance

1340
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,280
traditionally the operator selects one

1341
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,520
set of configuration which are then

1342
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,679
homogeneously used for the entire user

1343
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:48,480
base

1344
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,239
and in this work we we asked this

1345
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,080
question that is this approach really

1346
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,440
optimal

1347
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,799
so can you go to the next step please

1348
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,280
so in fact when we look at the client

1349
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,880
here or the user base we see that

1350
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,800
there's a diversity there uh users come

1351
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,239
from different regions have different

1352
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:07,840
last-minute connections like 2d 3g 4g

1353
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
and it's a problem because

1354
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,600
the performance of the protocols is

1355
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,199
sensitive to the type of network and

1356
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,480
devices

1357
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,040
so assuming that us an edge has three

1358
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,719
users uh one with low latency one with

1359
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,600
high bandwidth and one with high loss

1360
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,880
network parts

1361
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,800
the choice of optimal configuration can

1362
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,080
be very different

1363
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,239
based on the type of network

1364
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,480
and in fact we did some measurements at

1365
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,159
scale that actually showed that there's

1366
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,560
a tremendous opportunity here there's an

1367
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,360
opportunity to improve web performance

1368
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,120
and the figure here shows the

1369
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,679
improvement in ph low time for websites

1370
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,760
and there's up to 70 improvement at tl

1371
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,920
if we are using uh some sort of an

1372
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,040
article to uh configure the right

1373
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,880
configuration on the per connection

1374
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,080
basis

1375
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,960
so next please

1376
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,679
so in this work uh we propose a system

1377
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,520
that optimizes web performance by

1378
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,679
systematically reconfiguring the

1379
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,120
networking stack

1380
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,800
so basically taking into features such

1381
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,440
as users network uh the device and

1382
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,640
website

1383
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,920
our system

1384
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,719
selects uh predicts the right set of

1385
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,280
configuration that should be

1386
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,800
expected to maximize the performance

1387
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,520
next slide please

1388
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,600
so we proposed uh two changes to the

1389
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,320
existing uh cdn architecture

1390
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,800
we first proposed a data path component

1391
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,920
that runs at a server level and it

1392
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,600
it is basically a modification of the

1393
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,760
today's networking stack and it allows a

1394
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,560
flexible reconfiguration so that we can

1395
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,880
tune things like tcp condition control

1396
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,080
or http on a per connection basis

1397
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,920
and the second component is a global

1398
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,159
control path uh that uses some

1399
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,320
algorithmic and some machine learning

1400
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,960
magic to try to predict the right set of

1401
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
configuration that that can be used so

1402
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,960
basically this this runs in a data

1403
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,280
driven sort of model and it ingests data

1404
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,719
uh from the servers and uh models the

1405
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,360
performance of different configurations

1406
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,239
uh next site please

1407
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,760
uh so in this work uh we asked this

1408
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,719
question that uh since it's hard to

1409
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,800
make or design protocols that are

1410
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,880
generalizable across different types of

1411
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,560
networks and devices

1412
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,679
perhaps this is the right time where we

1413
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,400
should invest and design systems

1414
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
that can make that

1415
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,320
our networking stack architecture more

1416
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,719
flexible so that our networking stack

1417
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,440
can dynamically adapt to what the users

1418
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,960
have on their end

1419
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,320
so if you are interested in learning

1420
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,400
more about it please reach out to me or

1421
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
my advisor theo benson

1422
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,800
or you can take a look at our nsdi paper

1423
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,600
uh

1424
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,440
i'll be also in philadelphia from

1425
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,600
tomorrow and uh if you want to talk more

1426
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,360
about it we can definitely do that

1427
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,400
thanks

1428
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,270
thank you

1429
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:04,719
[Applause]

1430
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,199
yes next we have jake talking about

1431
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,800
multicast quick

1432
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,560
i will find your slides

1433
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,840
all right thanks

1434
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,600
you can probably just go to the next one

1435
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
right away i'm jake and i'm talking

1436
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,960
about multicast quick um

1437
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,440
and uh yeah next slide uh the basic

1438
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,199
premise there's a draft go ahead and

1439
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,040
read it um the basic premise here is

1440
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,840
that uh unicast is a real problem i've

1441
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,960
been working on this for a while i've

1442
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,199
been talking to a lot of isps uh got

1443
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,199
some ideas about how to get them to

1444
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,800
transport it but then the next step is

1445
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,840
what are we going to transport next

1446
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,199
slide please

1447
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,480
um

1448
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,840
and

1449
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,080
the basic idea is ip multicast is what

1450
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,880
we want to use um so we proposed a way

1451
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,960
to trans to to let quick use that

1452
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,840
um

1453
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,239
next slide please

1454
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,199
uh

1455
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,080
so

1456
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,920
just i'm not gonna go over the whole

1457
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,199
thing of course um read the draft but uh

1458
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,040
the the basic idea is you're still going

1459
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,960
to have a single unicast connection

1460
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,040
between any two endpoints you're going

1461
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,480
to be the server is going to tell the

1462
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,960
client hey join these channels um

1463
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,199
client's going to be sending acts uh so

1464
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,040
server knows what channels it got what

1465
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,239
what data it's getting from these

1466
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,199
channels

1467
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,440
and

1468
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,280
and the multicast is going to be used

1469
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,600
for server to client only so this

1470
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,040
matches up with the security

1471
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,360
consideration stack that we presented in

1472
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,600
sec dispatch in 112 we think

1473
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,440
and uh we are

1474
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,560
looking to

1475
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,719
get a prototype running

1476
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,199
next slide please

1477
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,120
so uh

1478
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,480
i just wanted to let people know about

1479
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,000
it i'll be talking about this a little

1480
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,080
bit more in the quick working group on

1481
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,080
thursday

1482
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,520
we've got

1483
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,120
you know we've got the draft we'd love

1484
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,719
to get feedback on it anybody who wants

1485
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,239
a review

1486
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,000
we've been working on an implementation

1487
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,040
with the w3c multicast community group

1488
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,239
if you're interested you can join us

1489
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,560
there and contribute to that

1490
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,520
uh my email is there you can ping me and

1491
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,920
please come to quick and or find me

1492
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,679
anytime this week and give me comments

1493
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,080
and i'd love to have them

1494
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,800
or my co-author max here raise your hand

1495
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,640
anybody can find either of us and we

1496
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,679
will

1497
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,360
take all your feedback and do what we

1498
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,799
can with it thank you very much

1499
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,719
uh last speaker will be stuart chester

1500
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,640
who will be talking about network

1501
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,280
latency why it matters how to measure it

1502
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,320
and what to do about it

1503
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,800
and i will find your slides in just a

1504
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,800
second

1505
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,000
okay

1506
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
perfect

1507
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,320
no that's not good that's not you

1508
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,520
uh i will i will now go find the next

1509
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,159
slide which is actually the right slides

1510
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,600
i think i just clicked on the wrong one

1511
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,600
sorry

1512
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,880
i don't know why that keeps jumping down

1513
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,280
but it did

1514
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,760
all right that's better okay excellent

1515
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,679
my name is stuart chercher and for the

1516
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,520
last four minutes today i'm going to

1517
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,920
talk a little bit about latency

1518
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,480
let's move on

1519
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,280
we're all very used to thinking about

1520
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,880
performance in terms of throughput

1521
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,320
everybody knows how many megabits their

1522
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,560
home internet connection is and that's

1523
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,560
good for big downloads but for

1524
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,480
everything else that we do

1525
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,199
for

1526
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,800
maps driving directions weather

1527
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,880
forecasts every time you're sitting

1528
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,360
watching an app with some little spinny

1529
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,320
wheel waiting waiting waiting it's not

1530
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,800
because you don't have enough bandwidth

1531
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,520
it's because you have too much delay

1532
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,360
this affects lots of things that are

1533
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,159
very obvious like online gaming video

1534
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,520
conferencing

1535
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,600
it affects many other things even if

1536
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,520
you're watching a two-hour streaming

1537
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,480
video

1538
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,199
if you want to skip to another chapter

1539
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,719
then suddenly it's the latency that

1540
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,520
affects the performance of that

1541
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,400
okay next please

1542
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,640
last year

1543
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,280
some of my colleagues at apple put out a

1544
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,280
new measurement tool

1545
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,120
the instructions for how to enable it or

1546
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,120
at this link which is in the pdf on the

1547
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,840
website and when you enable that if you

1548
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,920
tap on the i button

1549
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,159
then

1550
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,199
yep next please

1551
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,800
then you see

1552
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,400
a button for diagnostics and when you

1553
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,000
tap on that

1554
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,080
it will show you the responsiveness of

1555
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,719
your network

1556
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,520
we present this in round trips per

1557
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,480
minute

1558
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,440
because

1559
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,280
most people like metrics where more is

1560
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,000
better and milliseconds is a fairly

1561
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,320
abstract concept to a lot of people even

1562
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,159
for us in this room how much is a

1563
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,920
millisecond well it's too small to

1564
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,480
notice does it really matter so we

1565
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,760
wanted a number that is more uh people

1566
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,719
relate to more easily

1567
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,199
next please

1568
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,719
since last year waveform has put out a

1569
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,880
really good buffer bloat test professor

1570
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,719
william hawkins from university of

1571
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,480
cincinnati has got an open source

1572
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,199
implementation in go

1573
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,519
and

1574
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,920
more recently

1575
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,960
ookla

1576
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,640
makers are probably the most popular

1577
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,920
speed test

1578
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,159
app and website on the internet have

1579
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,199
added a measure of working latency

1580
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,760
so if you're not staying in the ietf

1581
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,080
hotel when you get back to your hotel

1582
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,120
tonight try out the ucla speed test on

1583
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,639
your hotel

1584
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,199
try it on your mobile phone on lte and

1585
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,400
5g try it at home try it at work

1586
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,360
you may be very shocked by the results

1587
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,600
until now speed tests have told you the

1588
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,320
idle latency in milliseconds

1589
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,159
but that tells you how well your network

1590
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,639
works when no one is using it

1591
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:36,719
that's not very useful what we want to

1592
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,560
know is how well your network works when

1593
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,600
it is being used and speed test will now

1594
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,000
report this

1595
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,719
so we know there's a problem

1596
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,560
what are we going to do about it

1597
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,120
the answer in my opinion

1598
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,960
is l4s

1599
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,400
it's a new

1600
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,360
method of doing congestion control

1601
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,040
in partnership between the end points

1602
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,040
and the network it's called low latency

1603
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,280
low loss scalable throughput

1604
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,760
and i can't explain all of this in one

1605
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,320
slide but the summary is

1606
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,880
it works to keep q short by keeping q

1607
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,679
short we keep round trip delay short

1608
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,840
as soon as a queue starts to build up at

1609
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,400
the bottleneck link it uses ecn marks to

1610
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,239
tell the sender to slow down

1611
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,879
next one please

1612
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,600
we had a lot of representation at the

1613
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,199
hackathon let's move through these

1614
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,960
pictures quickly

1615
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,639
go ahead next please

1616
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,480
uh we had two cmts racks set up next

1617
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,600
we had

1618
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,679
we took over a big chunk go on next one

1619
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,320
please we took over a big chunk of the

1620
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,920
hackathon room

1621
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,320
uh next couple of slides please we had a

1622
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,080
whole bunch of equipment piled up on

1623
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,120
desks

1624
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,960
uh a lot of energy

1625
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,920
so

1626
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,239
uh to learn more there's a great buy tag

1627
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,159
report if people ask you about latency

1628
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,840
you'd only spend an hour explaining it

1629
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,760
yourself pointing to this report if you

1630
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,920
prefer video there's an apple developer

1631
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,480
conference presentation about 15 minutes

1632
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,560
long by my colleague vidi goyle who's

1633
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,760
here today and last slide please come to

1634
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,920
can you go to the last live please

1635
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,600
can you put up the last slide oh yeah

1636
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,679
yeah yeah yeah

1637
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,239
okay come and see us on monday and come

1638
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,600
on friday if you're interested in the

1639
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,800
measurement thank you

1640
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,199
thank you and let's give her

1641
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,440
yes

1642
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,840
the the actual applause for for stewart

1643
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,760
and then let's give a round of applause

1644
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,000
for all of our speakers today

1645
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,239
[Applause]

1646
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,960
thank you all for coming uh and thank

1647
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,679
you for your patience as i figured out

1648
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,480
what i was doing which

1649
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,760
yeah

1650
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,639
and enjoy your itf and do the right

1651
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:53,760
thing

1652
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,760
bye
