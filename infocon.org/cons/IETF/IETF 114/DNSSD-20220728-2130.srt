00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
people trickling and then get started

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
and in the meantime if you're not um on

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,279
the meat echo then please scan the qr

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,279
code

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,760
yeah do

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
we have volunteers to take minutes and

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
or jabber scribe

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
can anyone be the jabber scribe it just

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
means watching on the scribe and if

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
someone says make colon you relay what

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,280
they say at the microphone

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
we'll smile at you to thank you

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
you won't see it through the mask but i

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,959
promise i will

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
i thought i can do that it's a very low

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,320
effort role these days

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
and can we have a backup to take notes

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
from what stuart is saying when stewart

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
goes up to the microphone who would be

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
willing to do that it's a collaborative

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
tool so you could just add edits and it

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,759
works really well

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
it's funny i've never seen everyone look

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
at their email so intently than when i'm

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
looking for a minute taker

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,439

uh my name is david skenazi and this is

44
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
chris bucks and we are here to talk

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
about dns service discovery

46
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
um

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
this is the note well

48
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,720
note it well um this is thursday so most

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
of you probably have seen it before

50
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
but in case this is your first meeting

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
we want to insist on a little bit

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
you

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
when it whether you're registered in

54
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
person or remotely you agreed to this

55
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
note well and if you haven't read it

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
before don't try to read it off the

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
slide the font's way too small

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
but it really matters into what we do so

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
for example when you

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
say something or type it in the chat or

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
on email

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,639
you it it it triggers some requirements

63
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
with regard to intellectual property

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
and it also says that you agree to

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
follow our code of conduct luckily that

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
we haven't had issues in this working

67
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
group but i just want to talk about it

68
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
to guarantee that we keep it that way

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
all right next slide please

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
uh

71
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320

next slide please

93
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
all right here are some useful links if

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
you're seeing the pdf on there don't try

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
to click that screen

96
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
next

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
uh similarly we have a github

98
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
organization um ted we should

99
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
sit down uh virtually at some point to

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,039
get

101
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
everything on github on there that'd be

102
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
nice

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
but maybe not for the ones that were

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
about to send to the isg because they're

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
almost done but for the new for new

106
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
adopted work i think that would be nice

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
uh cool

108
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
next slide

109
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,039
uh so

110
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,520
an update on our currently adopted

111
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
working group documents

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
so the srp draft has been in working

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
group last call for a year to the day

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
actually

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
um and those comments were addressed two

116
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,720
weeks ago so we're going to chat a bit

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,039
about that and

118
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,400
hopefully

119
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
start a second work group last call and

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
send it to the iesg in the near future

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
uh the update lease document was adopted

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
a little under

123
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
a year ago

124
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
we had the comments during adoption were

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
addressed the

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
that's not a whole lot of revisions but

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
it's a pretty short and simple document

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
so we expect it to um

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,039
be ready to progress as well and we'll

130
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,479
talk about that a bit and of course if

131
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,919
anyone has objections we'll give you an

132
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,080
opportunity to say so and the

133
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
advertising proxy document was adopted

134
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
last august and then some comments were

135
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
addressed and that one still needs to

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
work so that we'll discuss it in the

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
working group all right next slide

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,479
and then we have some individual drafts

139
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,199
that were published last year and some

140
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
of them were updated right before the

141
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
draft deadline so we can talk about

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
those and one of them is expired

143
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
um all right

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
intentionally all right so we can remove

145
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
it from the uh from the list

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
uh we can talk about that one later uh

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
our current agenda is kind of going

148
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
through these drafts in order i realized

149
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
that we kind of tweaked the agenda a

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
little bit talking with ted and we

151
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
forgot to update this slide

152
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
but uh talking through the working group

153
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
drafts their status then through the

154
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
ones that ted would like to see adopted

155
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,840
in

156
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,080
uh the nearest future

157
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
and then some open discussion time um

158
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
so would you like to bash the agenda

159
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,239
that is not on this slide

160
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,120
are we

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
missing something

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
so uh i had suggested that maybe we want

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
to talk about uh unicast's dnssd but if

164
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
time allows but

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,639
i don't know if that needs to be

166
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
explicitly on the agenda

167
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
yeah that sounds great

168
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
it is on the agenda that is listed on

169
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
data tracker so we do plan to cover it

170
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
yes

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,120
cool

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
next slide please

173
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,720
uh oh right yes and i forgot to mention

174
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
in the agenda that we had a little

175
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,199
presentation from our area director eric

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
about a newly formed dns director tell

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
us more about that eric well actually

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
soon to be formed so next slide very

179
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
quick

180
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
so tim wichinski you mostly know him the

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
chair of deprived and dns

182
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
uh let's make some stats by looking by

183
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
the word dns in the file name for the

184
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
internet draft as well as in the

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
abstract about 59 of was cash since

186
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
april

187
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
including three no surprise from this

188
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
working group

189
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
but as well from others so next

190
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
these are basically non-working group

191
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,640
documents right so not yet adopted

192
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
and in some case it is nothing to do if

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
you look about the the potential like a

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
group name it has nothing to do with dns

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
of the private dd or the nssd

196
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
so we may assume that the knowledge

197
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
the dns knowledge of the people in those

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
working group

199
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
is not as high as in this room or other

200
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,440
room

201
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
like dns hop

202
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
so the fear of the ign we have seen is

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
we received document that has gone

204
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
through working group last call

205
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
working group last iatf last call

206
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
arrived at the isg and then we spot some

207
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
dns issue

208
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
it's a little bit late in the process so

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
what we want to do is recreate a dns

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
directorate so that any working group

211
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,360
based on the chairs of those working

212
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,040
group can request an early review

213
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
by the dns directorate

214
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,760
so next slide

215
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,720
so

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
we got a meeting

217
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,079
uh with add dns of dnsdsdn and deprive

218
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,040
shares

219
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
plus the isg and a couple of the two

220
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,880
meetings actually

221
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
to create this dns directorate

222
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,240
next week or a couple of weeks

223
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
we will be sending an email to the

224
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
community including this working group

225
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
asking for volunteers to be reviewers

226
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
early reviewers

227
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,959
of course you will not review all

228
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
documents coming out from any working

229
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,600
group

230
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
only the one those working group thing

231
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,320
there is a dns there a fully qualified

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
domain name local or

233
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,240
or some reliance on dns

234
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
and like in older iterate there will be

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
reviewers

236
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
we are looking not only for expert

237
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
and i'm looking about the two dns

238
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,440
mdns expert there to be at least one of

239
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
the two right

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
because mdns is special especially

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
really

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
but also in operation in privacy and so

243
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,839
on as well as junior

244
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,240
people right the aig really wants to get

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
a

246
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,440
pipeline of talent

247
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
so one way of growing talent is start as

248
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
a junior reviewer perhaps your review

249
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
won't be the most

250
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
perfect one but you will learn how to do

251
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,800
it and learn by mistake you need to

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
learn on the job so it's a point to

253
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
everyone around to marry and myself we

254
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
will basically select

255
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,240
those reviewers small group normally

256
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
and we are also looking for two

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
secretaries so tell the people they say

258
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,360
oh we got a request from working group

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
foo

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
which is the next reviewer so it's a

261
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
kind of a clerk or

262
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
bookkeeping thing a misrative thing that

263
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,000
you do once a week typically and you

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
select the right reviewer

265
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
and that's basically this i don't know

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,399
unsure whether they are questions

267
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,600
but basically there's a call for a

268
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
volunteer i will send over and we'll

269
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,959
send an email

270
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,880
end of august about this after the

271
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,240
vacation okay thank you

272
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
thanks thanks eric does anyone have any

273
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
questions for eric and

274
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
i want to underscore the point that

275
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,320
like you don't have to be the person who

276
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
invented dns to be on this directorate

277
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
knowing a little bit about is purely

278
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
sufficient and it's a great way to know

279
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,320
how atf works and to see documents that

280
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
you might not know so

281
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
if you're interested or have questions

282
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
uh talk to eric he's very nice

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
he is

284
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,320
all right so where do you want to drive

285
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
the slides

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
uh let's uh why don't we try with you

287
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,720
and see how it goes

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,279
because i always

289
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,040
have trouble regulating my breath when

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
i'm talking into a mic with a mask on so

291
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,839
i apologize um so first we're going to

292
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
talk about document updates next slide

293
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,800
so

294
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
the main document that the working group

295
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,440
still has has uh outstanding for a long

296
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,360
time is the srp

297
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
service registration protocol document

298
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
and that document was in pretty good

299
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,639
shape when we did the last call we got a

300
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
couple of additional comments

301
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
um

302
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
and i took kind of a long time to get it

303
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,839
done and and

304
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
um while i was working on the final

305
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
update um actually before i did the

306
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
final update i updated the tsr document

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,279
and i realized that there were some

308
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
terminology problems with the srp

309
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
document so the first

310
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
and fairly substantial change the srp

311
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
document is just changing all of the

312
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
sort of like server client service zones

313
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
things like that getting that

314
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
terminology correct

315
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
some srp clients are now requesters srp

316
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,079
servers are now registrars srp request

317
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,680
or srp registrar depending on where you

318
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
look

319
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
and that just reduces the confusion

320
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,560
there are a couple places where we talk

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
about dns update clients those are still

322
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
called dns or dns update requesters i

323
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,519
think

324
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,120
and then dns servers are still called

325
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
dns servers

326
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,760
um

327
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
so

328
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
and then

329
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
i noticed when i was doing the update

330
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
that the text that describes the

331
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
discovery of browsing domains was wrong

332
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
so i fixed that that was just me nobody

333
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
commented about that in the last call

334
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,199
unfortunately we're doing another last

335
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
call so if anybody thinks i'm wrong

336
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
about that they can correct me and then

337
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
there were just a couple of comments

338
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,320
from esco

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
about

340
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
suppressing unusual unusable records

341
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,720
which is something that came up when we

342
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
were talking about the advertising proxy

343
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
and also clarifying the service

344
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
discovery instruction section he found

345
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,800
kind of unclear i thought it was

346
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
perfectly clear i wrote it

347
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
but uh

348
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
but he had some suggestions and i

349
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
hopefully it's clear now so we still

350
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
need esko to tell me that i actually got

351
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
it right and we may do another cycle on

352
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
that and

353
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
the chairs have already decided we need

354
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
a working group last call

355
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
so

356
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,920
um any questions about srp

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
nobody's coming up to the mic

358
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,160
uh next slide so hold on before we move

359
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,880
on just to confirm for everyone

360
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,760
the uh working group last call has been

361
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,240
kind of going on for a while

362
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,320
and a lot of folks have forgotten about

363
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
it and i wouldn't blame anyone for not

364
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
remembering what they said a year ago

365
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
uh it's been a while so we're gonna

366
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
officially have a second working group

367
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
last call the really for a real last

368
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,959
call that's gonna like we're gonna start

369
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
it very soon and last for two or three

370
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,440
weeks

371
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
and hopefully if everyone can take a

372
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
look especially like these terminology

373
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
changes i know every time i do

374
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
replacements like this i get one of them

375
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
wrong

376
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,240
so please take a look

377
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,240
and then assuming that um esko was okay

378
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,480
because he had some comments before and

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,920
no one has some serious comments then

380
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,839
we'll send it over to the isg and so if

381
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,360
anyone has any concerns with this

382
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,320
approach

383
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
please say so now or doing the working

384
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
group last call

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
all right thank you

386
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
thanks

387
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
now next slide

388
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,440
oh

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
yeah there we go um yeah so the other uh

390
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
the other document um that's sort of

391
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,759
close to or hopefully at time for wglc

392
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,680
is the update lease document

393
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,759
um again the terminology change is a

394
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,199
little bit more restricted here because

395
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
the update lease document is not

396
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
actually an srp document so we don't

397
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
talk about srp requesters we just talk

398
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
about dns requesters dns update

399
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
requesters

400
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
um

401
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
the document was um

402
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,759
it's been around a long time and when i

403
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
was reading the document and i i saw we

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
did actually get some comments you guys

405
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
said there weren't that many comments

406
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
but we did get a couple comments and and

407
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,839
the comments seemed to largely be a

408
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,399
result of failing to understand the

409
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
behavior that was being described so i

410
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
tried to sort of organize things a

411
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,399
little bit differently

412
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
and talk about like the server behavior

413
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,399
and the requester behavior

414
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
for each type of message the update

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
message and request message are actually

416
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,759
the same message just in a slightly

417
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
different context the initial update is

418
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
obviously the initial one and then

419
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,920
refresh messages come later um

420
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
and uh so there was also a question

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
about like you know

422
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
disambiguating whether like like the

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
behavior for refreshment

424
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,720
messages was was was explained as being

425
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
different than the behavior for update

426
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
messages but that assumes that the uh

427
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
the

428
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,959
server

429
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
knows that it's a that it's a refresh

430
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,480
message because there isn't any signal

431
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,679
in the message that it's a refresh

432
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,640
message so um so there's some text in

433
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
there that just kind of clarifies that

434
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
and talks about like well you know

435
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,760
if the server knows it's a refresh

436
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
message it should do this but if it

437
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
doesn't know then obviously it can't

438
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,679
it's going to just see it as an update

439
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,280
message and this is what will happen if

440
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
that's the case so

441
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
hopefully that's clear

442
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,400
but

443
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
you know if if folks see that and it's

444
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,120
not clear to them please obviously

445
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
bring that up in the last call

446
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
and there was also a question on

447
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
the handling of the keys key lease

448
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
interval and i updated that

449
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
somebody asked whether there should be

450
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,520
iana considerations originally there

451
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,880
weren't iana considerations because

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
the

453
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
eds zero option has already been

454
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
registered however the registration for

455
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
the edns zero option is actually not

456
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,799
consistent with other eds zero option

457
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,200
registrations and so i added an in a

458
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
consideration section that just like

459
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
fixes those inconsistencies

460
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
um and also requests that the

461
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,720
the entry refer to this document and not

462
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
to draft sakara update lease

463
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,039
um so uh thanks for the folks that

464
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,280
reviewed this and um

465
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
i claim this is at least ready for last

466
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
call in the sense that

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
you know there may still be more things

468
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
to do but a last call will hopefully

469
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,000
catch them it's not so immature that

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,559
that's going to be a problem

471
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
uh

472
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
oh sorry we had a

473
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
uh meat echo failure right here um

474
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,039
well

475
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,919
while chris tries to fix that um i think

476
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
if you start sharing again it might work

477
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
oh no you or just

478
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,280
oh no it's working um so

479
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
yeah from the church perspective

480
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,799
this draft has gone through many

481
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,400
revisions but we're not you know

482
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
required to go through many revisions if

483
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
it's something simple and so we think

484
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
that a working with last call will be a

485
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,960
good way to

486
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
get people to review

487
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
and flesh or hash out any remaining

488
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
problems so

489
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
we're going to have a group last call

490
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
that has the same duration as the second

491
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,039
one for our srp at the same time because

492
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
it makes sense to page both of them into

493
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,679
memory

494
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,880
together

495
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,600
and we ask that folks please take a look

496
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
we'll want at least a few reviews before

497
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,840
we progress this to make sure that we

498
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
catch any mistakes

499
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,280
and then we'll progress them to the ahd

500
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
and if anyone has any concern with that

501
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
please

502
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
come and speak up now or

503
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
during the working group last call

504
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
that's also a perfectly valid time

505
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
all right by the way i just remembered

506
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,880
uh the reason for the key lease

507
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
uh documentation update was that

508
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
somebody asked like why do we have a key

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,919
lease thing and not like just

510
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
generically for any kind of thing and

511
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,159
that's because this document didn't

512
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,000
reference srp which is what needs the

513
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
key lease so i added that so

514
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,799
just for completion or completeness next

515
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,320
slide

516
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
um okay so advertising proxy update this

517
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
is actually um this document um i think

518
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
we're

519
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,400
converging on where we need to be but um

520
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
it's this was a fairly substantial up

521
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,400
update and re-reorg

522
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
i i don't actually remember the details

523
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
of how it was before but basically i

524
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
divided the document into talking about

525
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
the different functions that the

526
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
advertising proxy needs to do i also

527
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
updated the introduction and the

528
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
the uh

529
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
the abstract but but this is the main

530
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,720
updates were about how it functions

531
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,559
and it's kind of interesting like the

532
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
taxonomy that i came up with actually

533
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
isn't talking just about the advertising

534
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,400
proxy it's talking about all the things

535
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,840
that need to be present

536
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
in a thing that acts as an advertising

537
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,960
proxy that's also doing srp

538
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,000
um

539
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
and uh because you could be doing srp to

540
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
just a regular authoritative dns server

541
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
it doesn't have to be an advertising

542
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
proxy and so that actually wound up like

543
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
it's still basically talking about the

544
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
advertising proxy but there's a bunch of

545
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
stuff in there that's

546
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,799
you know

547
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
you could argue isn't an advertising

548
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
proxy like like uh

549
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
you know there's uh

550
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
the srp registrar function basically is

551
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,520
an authoritative dns server

552
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
when you're doing an advertising proxy

553
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
in a

554
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,400
stub networks context

555
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
it might be bi-directional and you might

556
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
have different things on one side than

557
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840
on the other and so uh you know on the

558
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
stub network side you might need a

559
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
discovery proxy serving

560
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,919
information about the uh infrastructure

561
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,280
network side for those of you that don't

562
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,960
know about stub networks that's what the

563
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,799
snack buff was about earlier and um

564
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
since we're i don't think we're going to

565
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
go to working group last call on this

566
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,039
i'm not going to go into detail on that

567
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,480
but if you want more details about that

568
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
you can ping me on the mailing list

569
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,840
and i suspect we'll wind up discussing

570
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,720
this on the mailing list um

571
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,280
so discovery might i suggest if you want

572
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,159
more detail read the draft that too but

573
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
and you know and tell us and if there's

574
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
anything unclear ask on the list because

575
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
ted will answer the questions and also

576
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
clara improve the document so i think

577
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
that's a great way to make sure we

578
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
publish good documents yeah yeah i mean

579
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,799
absolutely you know we we have to

580
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
we have to uh people do need to read

581
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,640
this document to see what

582
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,080
you know to find bugs in it um

583
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
but i can help point you in the

584
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,039
direction of other documents you should

585
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,120
read although actually if you don't see

586
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,640
the pointer in the in the draft then

587
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,159
maybe it needs to be there

588
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
so um anyway the other thing is uh if

589
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
it's acting as a discovery proxy and

590
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,720
it's acting as an authoritative server

591
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
for the stub network it may also need to

592
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
be a full service resolver for the stub

593
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
network so then the question is like

594
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
have we just stopped talking about the

595
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
advertising proxy and really we need a

596
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
separate draft for this or or does it

597
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
make sense actually to talk about all

598
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
these functions in this draft so that's

599
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,559
a question the working group needs to

600
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,440
answer

601
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
um i kind of think it makes sense to

602
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
talk about the whole system in one draft

603
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,799
but

604
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
you know that's my opinion so i don't

605
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,200
want to

606
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
i don't want to assume that i'm correct

607
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,559
that's just how it looks to me

608
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,240
um

609
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,840
so that's that's the basic uh status um

610
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,559
and

611
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,840
you know i think

612
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
the document is fairly mature but but as

613
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,159
we discussed earlier it probably needs a

614
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,520
bit more work and

615
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,840
definitely needs more reading

616
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
thanks um

617
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
could we have some volunteers either in

618
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,720
the room or remote to say they'll read

619
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
the draft and send comments your

620
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
comments could also be just looks great

621
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,440
to me

622
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
but we'd love to get more folks to

623
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
to read it

624
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
anyone like to volunteer to read this

625
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,520
document

626
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,480
thank you

627
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
jonathan um hui

628
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,080
stewart if you could put that in the

629
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,159
minutes anyone else let me check the

630
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,120
chat

631
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,080
joey

632
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
oh joey as well

633
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
thanks

634
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
awesome no thank you that's very helpful

635
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
uh and i see our ad in the queue

636
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
yeah

637
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
uh eric link

638
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,120
quick question and quick suggestions

639
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
i like the idea to keep the discovery

640
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
proxy and the full service resolver in

641
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
the same document but i would suggest to

642
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
change the title yeah then i think

643
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
that's coming if we have to if we do

644
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
that yeah okay okay perfect yeah

645
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,120
and then my intention was to bundle

646
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,840
those three documents in the same

647
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,559
cluster before the isg evaluation so to

648
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,159
keep them together

649
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
because it's way easier to progress all

650
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
together

651
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,679
if it's delaying everything six months

652
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,799
or one year

653
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,320
then this may be not a good idea so at

654
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,559
some point of time i think the author of

655
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,240
the working group and the chair we need

656
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
to understand how to proceed those three

657
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
together because it's way easier for the

658
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
rest or separately yep that makes sense

659
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
i i think it absolutely makes sense to

660
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
progress them together if we can

661
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,279
um hopefully we don't need to make too

662
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,360
many more changes we did a pretty

663
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,799
i mean i tried to do a pretty thorough

664
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,400
update but obviously

665
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,760
one person writing an update doesn't

666
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
mean that everybody's gonna understand

667
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,159
what i wrote or agree that it's the

668
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,440
right thing so

669
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
hopefully that won't take too long

670
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,279
awesome okay that sounds like a good

671
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
plan and we'll see based on the uh how

672
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
the review looks if we think we're in a

673
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
place to move them forward yep not too

674
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
long after the other ones

675
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,159
okay

676
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,720
next slide

677
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,960
okay so um

678
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
srp replication this is not a working

679
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
group document i'm just telling you guys

680
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,520
about it because i think it should be a

681
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,039
working group document

682
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,000
we now have two uh implementations uh

683
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
the open thread has an implementation

684
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,240
apple has an implementation uh we have

685
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,919
not done any drop testing and i know for

686
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,440
a fact that the implementations are

687
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
currently not interoperable

688
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
that's because the the open thread

689
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
implementation

690
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,440
did a bunch of new stuff that the apple

691
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,559
implementation has not yet tracked

692
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
so

693
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
there was an update to how replication

694
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
servers discover each other um this has

695
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
been i

696
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
this is by the way

697
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,039
there's been a criticism of like this

698
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,799
being the ted show i just want to be

699
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
clear that the all of the updates to the

700
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
latest document were actually from upton

701
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,000
and jonathan so uh so upton and jonathan

702
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
are both at google and both work on open

703
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
thread um

704
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
so um

705
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
this document um i think is actually

706
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,000
fairly mature it's a fairly complicated

707
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,159
thing that it's doing um i think it's a

708
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,240
really interesting thing that it's doing

709
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,200
um and hopefully there's i mean

710
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
general general interest in it um i'd

711
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
like to see the working group adopted it

712
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
you know i think it's ready to adopt at

713
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,240
this point whether the working group is

714
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
ready to adopt it is another question

715
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,320
but but it's it's in pretty good shape

716
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
yeah i think we're pretty close our

717
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,919
thing we discussed this among the chairs

718
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
and what we were thinking is

719
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
the two documents that we're going to

720
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
start the working group last call for

721
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
as soon as those like the working coupe

722
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,240
last call is successful and we send them

723
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,679
to the iesg

724
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
then we'll start the adoption

725
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,520
uh that way we keep the amount of work

726
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
in the hub not too high

727
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,039
but uh on that note if anyone has

728
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,919
concerns on this document and would

729
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,520
think that adoption would not be the

730
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,480
right play a thing to do um you have

731
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,039
some time here to come and and say why

732
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
uh because we'd love to hear that of

733
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,399
course there'll be a formal adoption

734
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
call maybe in a few weeks on the list

735
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,399
where people can also phrase concerns

736
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
but just wanted to make use of urban

737
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,559
person time in case someone has concerns

738
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,320
okay thanks uh

739
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,840
not seeing anybody come up next

740
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,000
slide okay so i can't remember if i

741
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
presented this at the last meeting

742
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,240
um

743
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,039
this was definitely i think we did um

744
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,520
so this is a document that um talks

745
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,760
about a kind of an edge case that

746
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,440
becomes a problem when you have more

747
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,480
than one

748
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
advertising proxy acting as an srp

749
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,799
server and they are for some reason not

750
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,080
in sync and there are a couple reasons

751
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
why they might not be in sync

752
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,679
the normal behavior of an mdns

753
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,960
responder

754
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
that has

755
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
that has authority for a particular name

756
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
is that

757
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
it's going to go out and try and see if

758
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,559
there's any other mdns responder out

759
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,360
there

760
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,320
that has authority for that name using a

761
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
probe and

762
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,559
if it discovers if it gets a reply back

763
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,399
with an answer with data in it that

764
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,559
conflicts with the data that it has

765
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,200
then it's going to tell whoever told it

766
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
to advertise that data

767
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,799
you know

768
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,240
it could be a server it could just be a

769
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
program that's doing that but

770
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,159
in either case

771
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
basically it's going to report back a

772
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
name conflict and so the idea is first

773
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,320
come first serve whoever advertises in

774
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,080
mdns a particular name first gets it

775
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,440
somebody else comes along tries to

776
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,760
advertise the same name they lose

777
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,919
um and that makes total sense when

778
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,279
you've got like a printer coming onto

779
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,120
your network and it's got a particular

780
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,399
name and you want it to always be

781
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,600
advertising that name you don't want

782
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,039
some other printer to come along and get

783
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,760
the same name and confuse you

784
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,279
however

785
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,200
we've been doing some fun new stuff in

786
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
in the dns ssd working group over the

787
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
last few years and one of the things

788
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,760
we've been doing is srp

789
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,120
and advertising proxies and an

790
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,679
advertising proxy basically so srp

791
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,720
updates a

792
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,960
dns authoritative zone notionally at

793
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
least

794
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
and an advertising proxy reflects the

795
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
contents of that zone to

796
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,679
a particular network link or links

797
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,320
using mdns

798
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,600
the problem with that is if you've got

799
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,760
two advertising proxies both of which

800
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
can in principle receive srp updates

801
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,520
from the same

802
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
srp

803
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,039
uh what's the word

804
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,360
requester thank you

805
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
it's a new terminology to me

806
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
um so so if you um

807
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,559
if you if you have um

808
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,880
if you have two srp one srp client two

809
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
srp servers

810
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
there are situations where

811
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
an srp requester might have registered

812
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,600
with a particular srp registrar

813
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
and then it's unable to re-register with

814
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
that registrar when some information

815
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,000
changes prior to

816
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,279
the

817
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,720
lease on that information on the

818
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,840
original server expiring so we use the

819
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,720
lease on the server to expire stale data

820
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,080
but sometimes the data needs to be

821
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,399
refreshed before it's stale in fact

822
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,120
frequently when there's an event

823
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,559
like a you know

824
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,279
in a thread network for example we use

825
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
srp and thread networks are our

826
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
self-organizing mesh networks and you

827
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
can have some kind of thing like

828
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,159
somebody closes the door and suddenly

829
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,840
the mesh can no longer

830
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,640
see

831
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,200
like it's been divided into two meshes

832
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,279
and each one of them has a different srp

833
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,440
server now you have a client that might

834
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,279
have registered with the srp server

835
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,880
that's on the other mesh that it's not

836
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
on so it's going to re-register with the

837
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,679
srp server srp

838
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
registrar that's on the mesh that it's

839
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
on

840
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
and that srp registrar is going to get

841
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
new data and we want the new data to win

842
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,000
so remember this is we with mdns we have

843
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,760
first come first served so that means

844
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
that the old data is going to win which

845
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,360
is exactly what we don't want in this

846
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
particular case

847
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,399
and so the time since received

848
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,559
spec is basically defining a new eds

849
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,640
zero option or actually it's a new

850
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,120
uh sorry it's a new dns rr type that's

851
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
mdns specific it's not really intended

852
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
for use with dns um but this new rr type

853
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
um allows us to say

854
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
when

855
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
in seconds in the past we received the

856
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
registration for the particular

857
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,120
information

858
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
that we're advertising over mdns in our

859
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,320
mdns probe

860
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,559
and so if another

861
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,600
server

862
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,360
is also doing tsr

863
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,679
then it's going to get the it's going to

864
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,600
get the probe it's going to look at its

865
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,760
time since registration like when it

866
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
received the registration and notice

867
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,320
that its registration is older and

868
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,399
because the tsr is there it knows that

869
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,080
we're not doing first come first serve

870
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,559
we're doing freshest data wins

871
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,399
and so it's going to relinquish its hold

872
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,360
on its old data and now the uh

873
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,480
the new

874
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,919
registration is going to is going to

875
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,919
take over so that's kind of the primary

876
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,200
motivation there are also some other

877
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
edge cases with srp replication where

878
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
you can have a momentary conflict that

879
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,279
you'd rather come out with the new

880
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,039
registration winning

881
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,200
their srp replication will ultimately

882
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
clean things up but you

883
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
you'd rather not have to deal with that

884
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,240
so

885
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
uh so this is this is a document that i

886
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,440
think is pretty

887
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
important for the uh for the srp plus

888
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
advertising proxy

889
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,559
situation um and

890
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,919
i'd like to see the working group

891
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
adopted it's pretty simple

892
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,080
um that said when we did our initial

893
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,519
implementation we got it completely

894
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,640
wrong

895
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,080
and so

896
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,480
fortunately stewart sorted us out and we

897
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,399
managed to get it to work so so that's

898
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,240
why the document's been updated

899
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
so

900
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
thanks so

901
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,120
similar to the other document we'll be

902
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,399
waiting a little bit until we get the

903
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,159
other ones out the door

904
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,039
uh and then what would be really nice if

905
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,000
um

906
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,919
we got um

907
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,679
uh so we haven't you i see you have a

908
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,080
co-author from apple which is awesome

909
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,399
and it would be great if you had someone

910
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,679
maybe interested in another

911
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,640
implementation as well uh you know we're

912
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
talking to on minimizing it being the

913
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,519
ted show

914
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,919
um so maybe you know we don't have time

915
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,360
we don't have to make an absolute

916
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,679
determination but if you can try to find

917
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,519
someone else as well who's willing to

918
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,120
help who's maybe from a different

919
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,640
affiliation i think that would probably

920
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,799
make the document stronger

921
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,919
um but otherwise yeah if anyone

922
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,440
thinks this is interesting and wants to

923
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
learn about how writing rfcs is this is

924
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
a great opportunity for you

925
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,799
and

926
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
you don't have to be an expert to write

927
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,960
an rfc like none of us were when we were

928
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,199
right wrote our first one right yeah and

929
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,760
also you have experts on hand so you can

930
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,599
get advice from them um

931
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,960
and you don't also you also don't

932
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
necessarily even have to be an expert on

933
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,079
the protocol the main thing is like you

934
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,440
know people make comments somebody's got

935
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,839
to update the document and you might

936
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
have a discussion with the authors who

937
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,159
are experts on the protocol to figure

938
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
out whether what the person says is

939
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,199
sensible and how to address it but it

940
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,800
doesn't have to be that like the person

941
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480
updating the document is like a super

942
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,679
protocol expert who's done an

943
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
implementation yeah so if you're

944
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,440
interested reach out either you know in

945
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,280
person after the session or by email to

946
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
to the current authors or to the chairs

947
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,839
whatever you prefer

948
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
okay so that's all of the document

949
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
updates

950
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,359
if anyone has any questions about this

951
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
documents or comments this is also the

952
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,359
time otherwise we're going to switch to

953
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,920
the next set of slides

954
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,359
all right

955
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,240
so

956
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,040
by the way that document uh about uh

957
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,280
discovering dns servers

958
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
um

959
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,160
is actually the one that expired the one

960
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,839
that expired is actually germaine to the

961
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,480
next discussion oh perfect yeah so

962
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
so these slides are basically here uh

963
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
for the purposes of discussion or just

964
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
presenting the problem depending on what

965
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,599
happens if nobody's interested in

966
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,960
discussing this then nobody's going to

967
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,079
come up to the mic and i'm just going to

968
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,440
breeze right through these slides and

969
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
i'll explain them in some detail and

970
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,160
hopefully that will be useful to people

971
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,839
who are listening and you'll get some

972
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,400
ideas and come back on the mailing list

973
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
but definitely like if you have

974
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,119
uh something to contribute

975
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
or you know some questions or whatever

976
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,480
in the middle of this presentation don't

977
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
wait until the end of the presentation

978
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,040
come right up it doesn't matter if we

979
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,920
get through to the end of this

980
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,440
presentation or not we're just the whole

981
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
point of having this presentation is to

982
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
have a discussion about

983
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
making unit unicast d and ssd real

984
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,280
so let's go to the first slide

985
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
so uh state of the art we already have a

986
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,280
manual

987
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
unicast dnssd you can update his own

988
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,079
file and if you do like if the the ietf

989
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,520
has has his own file and if you do a dig

990
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
then you'll get back you know this i i'm

991
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
assuming you know a little bit of dnssd

992
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
terminology so if you dig for an

993
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,240
iprinter at

994
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,040
meeting.ifidtf.org you get back a couple

995
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
of pointer records and if you dig down

996
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,640
into those you get the srv records you

997
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,079
get the text records and so forth and

998
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,640
you'll be able to print um so so if you

999
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
have like you know pretty much any

1000
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,800
commercial

1001
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,640
operating system and also linux

1002
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,839
it will be able to discover these

1003
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,359
printers and print on them cups will

1004
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,800
find these automatically if you have

1005
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,520
cups installed

1006
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
and then

1007
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
also we have

1008
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,200
sorry stuart from apple um

1009
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,880
probably most of the people in the room

1010
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
know this but i just want to

1011
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,000
check it because there might be some who

1012
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,880
don't

1013
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,760
um

1014
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
the reason ted is showing this is not

1015
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
because we expect anybody to be typing

1016
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
dig commands right

1017
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
if you're on your iphone and you press

1018
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,680
the share button on a web page and go to

1019
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
print you will see that ietf114 printer

1020
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
shows up in this available printer right

1021
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,160
and that's because your iphone is doing

1022
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,119
this query to ask this network are there

1023
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,160
any printers i can use so

1024
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
that's uh maybe that's obvious to

1025
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,599
everybody but i just wanted to make sure

1026
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,200
yeah the reason i put the guts up on the

1027
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,119
slide is actually because i

1028
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,720
there could be some dns people who don't

1029
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,480
know dnssd that well and i want to just

1030
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
give them a little view of the of the

1031
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,320
guts of the protocol but yeah that's

1032
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,000
absolutely right this is this is all

1033
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
done automatically you never want to

1034
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,000
actually have to type this stuff in so

1035
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
uh anyway moving on to the second piece

1036
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
of state of the art and this is

1037
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,440
something that if you

1038
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,079
uh if you buy like a

1039
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,480
uh an apple uh

1040
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,359
homepod mini or apple tv and i suspect

1041
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,720
there are other devices that do this but

1042
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,440
i don't know the details um

1043
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,359
like this is this was me actually doing

1044
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,079
a dig at my apple tv using mdns to

1045
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
discover the apple tv

1046
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,119
and then look up in default.service.arpa

1047
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,119
which is a domain that we happen to

1048
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,760
support for doing this kind of lookup uh

1049
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,280
any printers and it did an mdns query

1050
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,400
and it

1051
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,440
responded with a record with a ttl of 10

1052
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,560
that pointed to my brother laser printer

1053
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,440
at home

1054
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,040
so that was all done automatically

1055
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
that's that exists you can buy things

1056
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
that do that

1057
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
we have an rc that describes that

1058
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,079
it's really cool

1059
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,520
um

1060
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
and then uh we also have srp updating a

1061
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
dns authoritative server

1062
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
again uh you know like if you have any

1063
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
sort of thread border router including

1064
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,160
an apple tv

1065
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,320
or a mac mini the latest ones um

1066
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
they support srp updates and they

1067
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
support the advertising proxy of course

1068
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,000
the advertising proxy isn't really

1069
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,880
unicast but i mention it because srp is

1070
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
um just to give you an idea of what what

1071
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,119
building blocks we have already built

1072
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,680
what we already have available to use

1073
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,240
um and uh this is all this is all in

1074
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
open source code so it's not like it's

1075
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,359
just an apple proprietary thing i think

1076
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,079
that open thread has implementations of

1077
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,480
most of most or all of this stuff

1078
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,160
yeah jonathan knows everything about

1079
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,760
open thread so

1080
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,000
next slide

1081
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,160
do you mind me jumping up and in

1082
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,280
um let's go back to that slide because

1083
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
um

1084
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,880
i think ted sort of glossed over like i

1085
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,079
mind a miracle happened and um

1086
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,000
you know it might be you know it's the

1087
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,359
kind of thing that would be good to

1088
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
explain with the picture so

1089
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,839
where ted shows that dig command

1090
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,119
office.local under discovery proxy

1091
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,280
um i would just want to say a couple of

1092
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,119
sentences about more what's going on

1093
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,160
there

1094
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
traditionally today on most of our home

1095
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,280
networks

1096
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,680
devices using multicast dns are

1097
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,760
multicasting the whole network and we

1098
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,359
know that multicast on wi-fi is slow

1099
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,560
and unreliable and wasteful of spectrum

1100
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
and

1101
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,480
when you had two or three devices on a

1102
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,560
typical home network that wasn't a big

1103
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,119
deal now if i had up all my home kit

1104
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
devices and the garden sprinkler

1105
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,839
controller and the solar panel inverters

1106
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,839
there's more than 100 wi-fi devices on

1107
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,280
my network

1108
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,560
and

1109
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
when my iphone is looking for printers

1110
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
it multicasts every device saying are

1111
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
you a printer and all the light switches

1112
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,400
like no i'm still a light switch stop

1113
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
asking me

1114
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,839
so so what ted did with that command was

1115
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,280
instead of multicasting the whole

1116
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,560
network

1117
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,440
he sent a unicast to in this case his

1118
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,720
homepod

1119
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
and said look you probably have a cache

1120
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
that's up to date could you just tell me

1121
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,319
if there any printers without bothering

1122
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,599
everybody

1123
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,560
and

1124
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,520
um

1125
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,599
if if the homepod doesn't know it's

1126
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,760
going to multicast on your behalf but if

1127
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,359
somebody else asked the same question

1128
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,920
two seconds ago you don't have to spam

1129
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
the whole network with another multicast

1130
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,280
the homepod can just say yeah here's the

1131
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,400
answers and

1132
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,200
so

1133
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,079
this is the first step in the direction

1134
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,839
of trying to make a lot less use of

1135
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,480
multicast on our home networks and move

1136
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
more of it to unicast

1137
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,520
yeah

1138
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,040
i'll say two things that stuart was

1139
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,920
polite enough not to say one is ted you

1140
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,319
forgot the motivating slide which i did

1141
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,480
oops sorry um and two is um mdns is

1142
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
actually really smart like it's insanely

1143
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
smart it does all this cool stuff to

1144
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
avoid multicasting if it doesn't have to

1145
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,200
and so

1146
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,160
um

1147
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,000
every mdns responder that you have

1148
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,280
sitting on your network and every apple

1149
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
device you have every android phone you

1150
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,040
have

1151
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,160
every

1152
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
windows machine you have is doing this

1153
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,280
all the time

1154
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,040
they sit there and they listen for mdns

1155
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,800
packets and they're just passively

1156
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
snooping on the network all the time and

1157
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,839
they're building a little cache that

1158
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,599
contains all the information about all

1159
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,720
the services that they've seen

1160
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,560
advertised on the network

1161
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
if anybody ever asks whether there's a

1162
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,720
service present all the other devices

1163
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,680
that are on the network get that

1164
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,079
multicast and add the service to their

1165
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,200
cache

1166
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,880
this by the way explains why mdns is

1167
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
sometimes flaky if you have a network

1168
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
that filters out

1169
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,280
uh multicast packets then the cache

1170
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,240
building algorithm uh may make a mistake

1171
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,079
because you know somebody sent out a

1172
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,760
query it didn't see any responses and so

1173
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,680
it assumes there aren't any assumes that

1174
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,440
it also wouldn't get an answer if it

1175
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,800
sends out a query

1176
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
um and so you know if you have something

1177
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
that's suppressing multicast then you

1178
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,839
can wind up with an incomplete cache and

1179
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,520
uh negative responses when you should

1180
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,040
have gotten positive responses so um

1181
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,640
the discovery proxy is actually a really

1182
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,160
useful piece of technology because it

1183
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,720
takes out all of these mdns responders

1184
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,800
sitting around doing anybody can talk to

1185
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,480
a discovery proxy and get the same exact

1186
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,280
behavior as if they were talking to

1187
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,800
as if they were doing mdns themselves

1188
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,400
except that they're not doing all of

1189
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,839
that multicast snooping and they're not

1190
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,599
doing all that multicast

1191
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,680
uh broadcasting they're just you know

1192
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
they just send a unicast to the

1193
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,800
discovery proxy and the discovery proxy

1194
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,680
takes care of it for them so um

1195
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,560
so the motivation with unicast bonjour

1196
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,280
is

1197
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,560
um in a sense to get rid of of multicast

1198
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,440
on

1199
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
every link

1200
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,480
um or at least every link where we care

1201
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,920
about getting rid of multicast and that

1202
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
means every wi-fi link because wi-fi is

1203
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,720
not great with multicast

1204
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,440
if you have a

1205
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
a wi-fi mesh

1206
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
it's hard to get multicast to work well

1207
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
on a wi-fi mesh for

1208
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
you know complicated but

1209
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,920
probably fairly obvious reasons um

1210
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,560
and so being able to to do unicast

1211
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,800
instead of multicast

1212
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
in the same context and get the same

1213
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,359
results is a pretty clear win and so the

1214
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,000
question is can we do it and so the

1215
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,359
point of this slide is to talk about

1216
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,440
what pieces we've already done

1217
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,400
let's now go on to the next slide

1218
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,480
so what would it take

1219
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
um

1220
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,599
we need to be able to find the unicast

1221
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,839
dns ssd service right so thinking about

1222
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,680
the previous slide i just happen to know

1223
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
that office.local has a unicast dns ssd

1224
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,720
service so i did a dig pointed at that

1225
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,400
and i got my answer

1226
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
how did i know that because i just

1227
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
happened to know that all apple tvs have

1228
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,839
that and i happen to know that that was

1229
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,280
the name of my apple tv and so i could

1230
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,720
type it in obviously that's not going to

1231
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,760
do it that's not automatic what's that

1232
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,640
yeah yeah and i wrote it

1233
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,560
sorry step one for using this get a job

1234
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,520
at apple

1235
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,400
yeah

1236
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
i i know so much more about dnssd than i

1237
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,720
did before i started at apple it's very

1238
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,119
exciting um

1239
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,720
so um

1240
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
so we need to be able to discover the

1241
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,480
dns ssd service we also need to be able

1242
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
remember we want to do unicast in both

1243
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,920
directions right we don't want to just

1244
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
do unicast for discovering services

1245
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,520
because that's not as good as doing

1246
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,160
unicast for also advertising services

1247
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,040
so

1248
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,000
um

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,800
we need to be able to uh to discover the

1250
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,760
availability of an srp registrar on our

1251
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,040
local network

1252
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,240
um

1253
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,800
and uh

1254
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
i don't know why i said as above

1255
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
um

1256
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,400
oh discoverable no i don't i still don't

1257
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,680
know why i said it about i know i had a

1258
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,599
reason i just don't remember what it was

1259
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,760
um but so it's an authoritative dns

1260
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,400
server um that is being maintained by

1261
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,440
srp

1262
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,680
um

1263
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,240
we we need a discovery proxy because um

1264
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,960
stuart knows why i said as above

1265
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,480
uh i i think i know what you're trying

1266
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,359
to say

1267
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,000
um we have this is like two sides of a

1268
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,760
coin yeah we have

1269
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,480
clients that are looking for services

1270
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,640
want to discover a discovery proxy that

1271
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
can do that on their behalf and that

1272
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,520
eliminates one side of the multicast

1273
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
devices that want to offer services on

1274
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,800
the network

1275
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,680
want to be able to discover a registry

1276
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,920
that they can register with and those

1277
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
sound like very similar things and they

1278
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,359
are very similar things but one is a

1279
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,200
client looking for services and the

1280
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,040
other is services seeking to offer their

1281
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
services make them visible to clients

1282
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,839
right i think that's what you meant

1283
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,119
by yeah

1284
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,200
yeah so and um

1285
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,760
we need to uh let's see so yeah we need

1286
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,040
to we need to bear in mind that there

1287
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,400
are going to be devices on the network

1288
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,960
that don't know how to do srp right so

1289
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,040
like you know maybe i'm going to cram

1290
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,200
srp registration into some future

1291
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,440
version of

1292
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,319
some you know operating system

1293
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,200
but

1294
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,960
i can't assume that my

1295
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,119
brother printer is going to ever get a

1296
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,200
software update to do that so i'm still

1297
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,640
going to need to be able to do mdns to

1298
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
discover my brother printer hopefully

1299
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,480
future brother printers will fix this

1300
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,920
and maybe i'll get a firmware update but

1301
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,839
i can't count on it so we have to have a

1302
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,760
discovery proxy to to just get us

1303
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
the legacy clients the legacy services i

1304
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,640
should say

1305
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,480
we need a full service resolver um

1306
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,319
the reason we well

1307
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,560
so

1308
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,880
first full service resolver what what it

1309
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,440
gives us is that when we get a query

1310
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,680
uh for stuff on the local link the full

1311
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,240
service resolver you know on port 53 or

1312
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,400
whatever the full service resolver knows

1313
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,000
oh i need to go into this database to

1314
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,920
get that information not just forward it

1315
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
to my

1316
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,119
isp

1317
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
and the other thing is

1318
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,119
so we have all of these devices that are

1319
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,800
consuming this service but what if the

1320
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,119
service goes away

1321
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,440
we may not need this it depends on how

1322
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,119
we're doing the service

1323
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,480
if the service is provided by the

1324
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,680
network

1325
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,520
like by your home router well when the

1326
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,200
home router goes away okay you're not

1327
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,640
going to be able to do mdns but your

1328
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,760
home router went away you don't have

1329
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,960
wi-fi

1330
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,480
it's not going to matter that much when

1331
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,400
it comes back you'll have it again so we

1332
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,319
don't need to solve that problem but

1333
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,800
suppose that for example we decide that

1334
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
that because home riders don't currently

1335
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
offer this functionality uh maybe we

1336
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
want to offer this functionality that

1337
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,720
you can discover through mdns right

1338
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,000
discover

1339
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,839
you know the replacement for mdns using

1340
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,680
mdns and then you can stop using mdns

1341
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,240
until it goes away uh well okay so if it

1342
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,079
goes away then we need to fall back to

1343
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,480
mbns that's the point

1344
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,960
next slide

1345
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,400
so um and then another thing to think

1346
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,680
about and this is actually a hard

1347
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,720
problem

1348
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,680
um

1349
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,240
is how we address the various ways we

1350
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,160
could deploy this so

1351
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,079
a typical way to deploy it would be that

1352
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,440
you've got a single link in your home

1353
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,599
network and you just need to be able to

1354
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,359
do what you're already doing right right

1355
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,319
now you can already discover your

1356
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,440
printer on your home network you only

1357
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,680
have one link um

1358
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,000
and uh

1359
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,520
you know we just want to replicate that

1360
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,760
same functionality um

1361
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,559
another use case is where you have

1362
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,000
pretty much the same setup except you

1363
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,119
have some stub networks like you have

1364
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,040
some thread border routers or whatever

1365
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,480
that are connected to your home network

1366
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
and you'd like to be able to discover

1367
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,160
the services that are being advertised

1368
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,480
by hosts on the thread network as well

1369
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,680
as the services that are being

1370
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,760
advertised on the wi-fi network

1371
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,440
um you might have a multi-link network

1372
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
that's that's

1373
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,480
somewhat managed like a soho network or

1374
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,240
even an enterprise network

1375
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,000
um

1376
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and then so that's like what the network

1377
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,920
looks like and then there's the question

1378
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,520
of what the

1379
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,400
service offering looks like so so the

1380
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,920
service i'm talking about here is the

1381
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
unicast

1382
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,640
dnssd service so

1383
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,839
that service might be part of the

1384
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,440
infrastructure it could be something

1385
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,119
that comes on your home router

1386
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,079
uh

1387
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,599
it could be something that doesn't come

1388
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,880
on your home router

1389
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
if it doesn't come on your home router

1390
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,720
then maybe we want to offer it using

1391
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,280
mdns as i said earlier um

1392
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,359
it could also be managed by like you

1393
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,880
know an i.t staff

1394
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
right so there are a lot of ways this

1395
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,480
could happen so my point in putting up

1396
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,680
the slide is not to say what the

1397
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,200
deployment models are but just to talk

1398
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,119
about the deployment model problem so

1399
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,880
that we think about that

1400
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,359
next slide

1401
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,880
and then there's like the naming model

1402
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,800
so um

1403
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,319
you know the naming model for multicast

1404
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,319
dns is really simple everything ends in

1405
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,880
dot local right you can advertise names

1406
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,480
that don't end in local and mdns it's

1407
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,400
not forbidden and in fact i've used that

1408
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,160
functionality joey wrote some code that

1409
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,400
uses that functionality so so it does

1410
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,240
work but generally speaking when you're

1411
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,800
doing service discovery uh with mdns

1412
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,640
you're using.local so

1413
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,319
one naming model we could use is to just

1414
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,800
replicate that like

1415
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,520
you know if you say local then we

1416
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
do unicast

1417
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,760
dnssd to do the resolution for whatever

1418
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,000
is in dot local and dot local just means

1419
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,680
the network link that i

1420
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,240
found this service on right so you know

1421
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,800
you might have several network links um

1422
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,720
and each of those network links

1423
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,640
with multicast dns is its own little dot

1424
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,680
local

1425
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,880
those network links can actually have

1426
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,480
conflicting information on them which is

1427
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,839
a bit of a problem

1428
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,440
um and there's no way to resolve that

1429
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,720
because the links aren't connected to

1430
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,680
each other

1431
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,839
so there are problems with using.local

1432
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,720
that way but you can use local that way

1433
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,920
as long as you're willing to accept

1434
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,800
those failure modes

1435
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,839
so

1436
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,680
one nice thing about using.local is if

1437
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,800
the

1438
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,240
if your

1439
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,680
your dns

1440
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,359
you know all singing all dancing unicast

1441
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,119
dns sd

1442
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,880
uh discovery service goes away then

1443
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,000
you don't need to use a different name

1444
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
when you're using mdns so there's an

1445
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,520
advantage there

1446
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,440
again i'm not saying what we should do

1447
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
i'm just describing some of the issues

1448
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,400
and some of the ways we could think

1449
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,880
about this

1450
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,480
so another

1451
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,000
approach which we actually have been

1452
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,079
talking about more when we were doing

1453
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,079
the home net stuff we talked about this

1454
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,000
and i think the discovery broker

1455
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,520
document that stewart did a while ago

1456
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,920
which has expired talks about this and

1457
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
also the document that expired that we

1458
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,839
were talking about earlier

1459
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,079
talks about this and that is just give

1460
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,800
every link a a global name so every link

1461
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,400
has a name that is that is unique to

1462
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,839
that link and whenever you want to

1463
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,839
discover services on that link you use

1464
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,599
that name and so

1465
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,400
uh you know mdns dnssd has this concept

1466
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,280
of a

1467
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,599
legacy browsing domain and that's a list

1468
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,200
of

1469
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,960
a legacy browsing domain list and that's

1470
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,119
a list of domains that you

1471
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,960
sort of by default you know in your

1472
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,800
legacy behavior which

1473
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,880
we never actually figured out what the

1474
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,200
non-legacy behavior was so

1475
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,599
legacy behavior is the current behavior

1476
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,800
um

1477
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,160
you just

1478
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,000
do service discovery if you get a if you

1479
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,240
got a question like give me the list of

1480
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,440
all printers

1481
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,480
um and it doesn't specify a domain then

1482
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,400
the legacy browsing domain is what you

1483
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,359
use

1484
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,359
to iterate across the set of domains on

1485
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,559
which you're going to do that service

1486
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,680
discovery

1487
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,440
so

1488
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,520
so we could do that and we could

1489
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,359
the legacy browsing domain on any given

1490
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,200
link could be

1491
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,640
um a list of all of the

1492
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,680
the per-link names uh that are present

1493
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,359
in the local infrastructure right that's

1494
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,880
one way to solve this

1495
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
um these aren't necessarily mutually

1496
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
exclusive either right you could you

1497
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,400
could say you know whenever you do a

1498
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,079
local query that means the link that

1499
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,000
you're attached to but you're also

1500
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,079
allowed to do um

1501
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,079
you know you could do the same query by

1502
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,160
specifying the link the global name for

1503
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,760
that link and you would get the same

1504
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,839
list of answers so that's another

1505
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,160
approach so again

1506
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,839
i'm not prescribing anything i'm just

1507
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,280
saying like here are the naming models

1508
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,880
that we've we've been talking about and

1509
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,400
we need to figure out if we're going to

1510
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,800
do unicast dnssd we need to figure out

1511
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,480
how we're going to approach this we may

1512
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,400
come up with an approach that says you

1513
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,119
know in the most simple case we do

1514
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,599
local but we need to have this per link

1515
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,359
naming thing in our back pocket for the

1516
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,920
more complicated cases or we may say you

1517
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,280
know we really should do prolink naming

1518
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,200
because gosh that really solves the

1519
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,280
the name conflict problem nicely right

1520
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,240
so

1521
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,680
anyway those are

1522
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,160
those are some topics next slide i don't

1523
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,920
know if we run out obstacles yeah so um

1524
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
yeah one issue i was talking about

1525
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,000
legacy browsing domains one issue is the

1526
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,359
legacy browsing domain only works

1527
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,680
currently at least on apple

1528
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,960
platforms i don't know if this is true

1529
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,359
of other platforms if you don't specify

1530
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,920
a domain to to do service discovery in

1531
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,160
all right you just you pass null in for

1532
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,720
the domain and then it gives it uses the

1533
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,640
legacy browsing domain list as the list

1534
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,480
of domains to do queries in

1535
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,040
a lot of people pass.local

1536
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,280
and so do we need to override that

1537
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,280
um we have to kind of answer that

1538
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,319
question

1539
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,640
uh when we're thinking about the domain

1540
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,520
uh naming or the the link naming problem

1541
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,040
um

1542
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,920
so um

1543
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,839
you know if you do there are advantages

1544
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,599
to doing perlink naming as opposed to

1545
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,359
using.local if you do perlink naming

1546
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,280
then the name of the device doesn't

1547
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,359
change depending on where you are

1548
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,319
um

1549
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,799
if you don't do perlink naming or if you

1550
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,680
do perlink naming and do.local then if a

1551
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,960
device was discovered using local then

1552
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,799
it also has this other name which you

1553
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,559
could potent you could potentially use

1554
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,400
to talk to the device but you're not

1555
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,319
going to because you know the device by

1556
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,000
its local name which is not valid

1557
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
everywhere is that a problem i don't

1558
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,760
know if that's a problem that is just a

1559
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,359
thing to think about so we have a

1560
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,680
question

1561
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,079
thanks steve my name is subidas

1562
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,160
i just want to ask you a basic question

1563
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,119
when you say link right is it a

1564
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,280
and also you have a

1565
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,559
example of wi-fi right so is it the link

1566
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,680
means an ip link or is it a

1567
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,480
wi-fi layer link like a layer tooling

1568
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,200
yeah so i'm using wi-fi as a shorthand

1569
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,880
that's a good question i'm using wi-fi

1570
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,720
as a shorthand for the infrastructure

1571
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
link which might be

1572
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,160
a link that's bridged between ethernet

1573
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,240
and wi-fi or might be wi-fi only or

1574
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,599
ethernet only

1575
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,040
it doesn't really matter i just used

1576
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,799
wi-fi as sort of because wi-fi is the

1577
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,000
usual

1578
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,559
right right yeah also the reason i'm

1579
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,839
asking is that possibly even stuart know

1580
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,599
that

1581
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,760
in wi-fi new evolution happening with

1582
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,440
multi-link device right so today

1583
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,240
if i have a one radio in one link that

1584
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,960
means i have a full stack to the ip on

1585
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,640
that particular link

1586
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,160
even in

1587
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,640
so what is coming in future is that

1588
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,960
multiple links layer two

1589
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,200
will represent that one

1590
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,559
interface to the ip so that means i can

1591
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,520
have

1592
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,640
two links right with my device

1593
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,640
and i'm operating but i'm connecting

1594
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
with one ip link to the router to the

1595
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,960
back end right so i can then if i send a

1596
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,000
query

1597
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,839
right i can

1598
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,200
actually send

1599
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,480
only one link

1600
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,400
not the all links right

1601
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,119
so

1602
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,880
i'm just trying to understand that

1603
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,079
scenario that when the query goes will

1604
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,720
that query go to every

1605
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,240
wi-fi link or the query only go uh you

1606
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,440
know only one link to the network right

1607
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,960
i think stuart has an answer for that

1608
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,720
i'll just say for my own opinion that

1609
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,240
that that's a question we need to answer

1610
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,319
uh what i was actually going to say is

1611
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,720
um i'm not actually aware

1612
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,240
of what you're talking about with these

1613
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,480
new developments in wi-fi so thank you

1614
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,319
for coming up to the microphone to make

1615
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,240
us aware of that and we're kind of out

1616
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,680
of time now but we should definitely

1617
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,520
talk more and learn about that

1618
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,559
yes yes so yeah just to give you know

1619
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,359
since i'm also involved there so

1620
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,440
next generation wi-fi which is wi-fi

1621
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,760
seven which will come in

1622
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,040
24 right that's the market uh we are

1623
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,240
looking at i think what is happening in

1624
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,920
ieee is that

1625
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,400
a a device can have

1626
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,640
multiple links both for the endpoints

1627
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,920
and that ap

1628
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,400
and then it will only

1629
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,200
uh open up one interface to the ip and

1630
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,920
they don't hide the multiple lower links

1631
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,359
it's it's interesting because the use

1632
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,880
case that i actually care about is the

1633
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
exact opposite of the one you just

1634
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,359
described

1635
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,720
i want to be able to connect to multiple

1636
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,599
ssids using a single radio right so one

1637
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,720
thing one thing also we all know that

1638
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,400
you know

1639
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,880
in in ieee terms they don't talk about

1640
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
ssid right that's the deployment model

1641
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,520
right so that is of course something

1642
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,839
will evolve and how those are configured

1643
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,160
right but the way that things are

1644
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,040
evolving is that there is no visibility

1645
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,119
for the ip that the underlying the

1646
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,720
multiple links are

1647
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,839
and also

1648
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,200
it is allowed that device can

1649
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,119
have one at a time

1650
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,160
say two or three links but it can decide

1651
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,640
or operate only one link you know at a

1652
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,359
given time but it can have at least two

1653
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,319
links and that's where it is evolving

1654
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,760
well i certainly look forward to seeing

1655
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,520
this stuff when it when it's available

1656
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,280
to look at that sounds very cool wait

1657
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,599
for wi-fi seven yeah thank you

1658
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,799
cool thanks sabir yeah dave

1659
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,160
and i think we're gonna cut the queue

1660
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,640
after dave because we're almost yeah

1661
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,920
i'm doing this because i just figured

1662
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,200
you were about to do that i'm to take

1663
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,359
advantage of having been a note taker

1664
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,880
to continue sue beer's uh

1665
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,480
theme of expanding use cases um mdns is

1666
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,799
starting it adopted in the parallel

1667
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,720
universe called storage

1668
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,240
uh the end nvme over fabrics is the

1669
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,200
successor to iscsi as a network storage

1670
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,040
protocol nvme of is not an ietf protocol

1671
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,280
but it's using mdns to solve the

1672
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,799
discovery problem

1673
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,960
it's going to be doing it in exactly

1674
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,280
enterprise networks and the big ones

1675
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,359
where you don't dare let the multicast

1676
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,839
domain scale over over even a small

1677
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,319
portion of the network and so it's

1678
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,960
headed right for the for the problems

1679
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
this group this working was taking up

1680
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,400
this is another place to go looking for

1681
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,240
people who might be very interested in

1682
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,440
implementation

1683
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,839
can you uh you you actually know those

1684
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,000
people it sounds like

1685
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,559
um i got to be careful because one of

1686
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,240
the one of the things that gets in my

1687
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,000
way here is that nvme uh protocol

1688
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
development work is done under an nda so

1689
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
i have to have discussions like that

1690
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,880
with someone who's asked who's comp who

1691
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,520
whose company is under the same nda and

1692
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,760
i apologize for that difficulty totally

1693
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,160
understand um the reason i mentioned it

1694
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,920
is because it might be possible for you

1695
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,079
to tell them to talk to me so that they

1696
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,359
don't have to tell me anything about

1697
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,799
nvme they just need to tell me about

1698
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,839
what they need from me

1699
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,359
um we'll have to we'll have to look at

1700
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,079
the details here unfortunately storage

1701
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,440
is different enough from a printer that

1702
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,440
you will need to understand why the

1703
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,280
problem is different

1704
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,359
okay well we might also be under the nda

1705
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,839
i don't know

1706
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,240
anyway uh let's see did we

1707
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,240
cover everything

1708
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,640
yeah okay uh

1709
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,400
yeah i think we pretty much cover so so

1710
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,760
basically you guys now understand the

1711
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,520
problem

1712
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,359
