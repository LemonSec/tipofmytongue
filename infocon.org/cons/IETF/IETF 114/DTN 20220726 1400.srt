1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
videos

2
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,440
yes

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
um

4
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
i am recognized as a chair i am not

5
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
sharing anything that's why all i have

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
to do is

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,680
reload

8
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,919
not too bad

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
good morning everyone is this microphone

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
working can anyone hear me on the

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
internet as well as in the room

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,560
good morning rick

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
yes i'll take that as a scene good

14
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
morning ed how are you today

15
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,040
uh

16
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,319
better

17
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,360
good

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
so uh just just as a little bit of

19
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
background um ed was hoping to be here

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
in person but uh due to the vagaries of

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
covert he will be uh remote which is uh

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
unfortunate for some of us who wanted to

23
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
say hello to him but it sounds like

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
you're uh better

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,840
well definitely on the mend by the

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
center

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,599
so uh we don't have a great number of

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
people in the room but we have a fair

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
amount of people um online which is

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,599
great am i close enough to the

31
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,640
microphone

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
just an

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
pretend this is some kind of like

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,840
community disco wedding thing okay

35
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
i'm not i promise not to sing um

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
so

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
i think we should start because we're a

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
little bit late already uh we've got a

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
few people in the room but we've got

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
quite a few people dialed in which is

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
great to see um just as uh

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
can i make these slides move through

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
there we go so i will start the session

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
by just talking about the note well and

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
ed please just jump in and move your mic

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,959
and shout when you need to

47
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
um a note well i'm assuming many of you

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
have already attended an ietf meeting

49
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
before i'm familiar with the notewell if

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
you have not i recommend you take your

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,159
time to read this carefully

52
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
this is also available online for your

53
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
reference but the long and short of it

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,599
is

55
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,080
this anything you say at the microphone

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
or within the chat is a disclosure um so

57
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,159
be very careful about any ipr you wish

58
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,040
to discuss because you are disclosing it

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
and making it public as you do so the

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
fine details i am not a lawyer

61
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,880
are carried in the various pcbs uh i

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
recommend if you are uncertain to read

63
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
this carefully and ensure that you're

64
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,000
not going to make some terrible mistake

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
and get in trouble with your uh sponsors

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
lawyers

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
moving on

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
meeting tips um so most of you have

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
already managed to uh dial in remotely

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
so which is great to see i don't know

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
how you get to see this if you are

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
struggling to get in but they are

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
available through the data tracker so

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
i'm assuming those people are struggling

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
to get in can find the information on

76
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
how to get in in-person participants can

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,120
we request that you use the

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,440
in-person tool it's great on a phone

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
there are qr codes

80
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
liberally scattered around the room if

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
you scan that it will take you straight

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
to the relevant meeting

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
in person tool which allows you to put

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
your hand up and join the queue and

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
therefore we have one queue synchronized

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
between remote participants and

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
in-person participants which is uh great

88
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
also um

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
try and mute your microphone let's try

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
and avoid the embarrassing feedback and

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
all that kind of stuff you get with

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
remote participation but after two and a

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
half years of covid i think we're all

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
pretty savvy with uh dialing into

95
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
meetings

96
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,639
next up uh for those of you who um

97
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
can only access the slides and can't

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
hear me there's not much point be saying

99
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,639
this but the agenda is uh visible

100
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,160
through the data tracker that's the url

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
for it uh important information on how

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
to join the meet echo seems a little bit

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
ironic to uh show it through me tako but

104
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,800
it's there and most importantly if you

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
are struggling with meet echo there is

106
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,280
the url for how to get fixes for it uh

107
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
hot tip

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
put

109
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
some uh some emergency message including

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
the word meat echo into the chat and

111
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
they are pretty quick at responding to

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
you through the chat if you are

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
struggling with video or audio

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
so moving on um our agenda um

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
we originally asked for two sessions uh

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
one hour and followed by a two hour

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
session because in discussion between ed

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
and myself and various others it was

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,400
felt that

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
it would be productive to have

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,759
a

122
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
more of a working meeting to talk around

123
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
the very broad topics of naming and

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
addressing i think

125
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,759
between many of the

126
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
participants in the working group we're

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
starting to condense around some basic

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
ideas around naming and addressing we

129
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
don't have any drafts in progress on

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
this it would be great to get some

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,880
drafts here but before somebody

132
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
really puts their neck out and starts

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
writing an extensive draft i think

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
there's some general nervousness about

135
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
understanding the full scope and where

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
everyone else is is thinking so the idea

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
originally was we'd have a one-hour

138
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
session just to talk through the status

139
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
of the documents we've got and then a

140
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
two-hour workshop unfortunately we were

141
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,479
unable to get both sessions so we are

142
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
compressing it into one session today so

143
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
the idea is we will go through

144
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,160
um the various documents and some

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,479
questions to the working group

146
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,680
from the likes of keith scott and ccsds

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
and scott burley uh will also be talking

148
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
through his thoughts about naming and

149
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
addressing and what he's collated from

150
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
his conversations with interested

151
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
parties and that should kick into the uh

152
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,360
namibian addressing workshop which we

153
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
will reserve the second hour of the

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
session for uh minus five minutes of

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
open mic at the end

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,479
um

157
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,479
so

158
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
what's next uh okay so we always need a

159
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
minute taker um

160
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
adam's put his hand up already for those

161
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
who can't see uh but it is a shared um

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
note-taking system it's integrated into

163
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
meteco it's pretty good please don't

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
just rely on adam to do all the typing

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
because that's a bit unfair and most

166
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
importantly when you state your name at

167
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
the microphone if adam has missed it and

168
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
misspelled your name or has misquoted

169
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,319
you just just double check he's got that

170
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
right because people talk fast and

171
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
people get excited hopefully other

172
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
reference mailing lists

173
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
you should be subscribed to the gtm

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
mailing list if you want to hear the

175
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
inter

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
meeting conversations that are happening

177
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
and if you need to contact the chairs we

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
have a

179
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
an at ietf

180
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
email address which will contact both ed

181
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
and myself

182
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
i will pause here to say is there

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
anything else you want to add because i

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,958
am just talking at the moment

185
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
um no so i can um

186
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,719
i just want to make sure you you can

187
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,880
hear me okay my volume is all right

188
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
no i think that's a good intro i'm sorry

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,920
i couldn't be there in person and um i

190
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
just wanted to take a moment and and

191
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
talk a little bit about the uh ccsds and

192
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
the sis dtn uh working group and maybe

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
we can use that as a roll into our first

194
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
set of presentations and and discussion

195
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
topics

196
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
so uh for the for those in in the ietf

197
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
who are unaware uh the ccscs is the

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
consultative committee for space data

199
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,680
systems uh and it is a standards

200
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
organization a peer standards

201
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,959
organization that

202
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,160
that builds uh standards for uh space

203
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,440
and

204
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
in in that organization there is also a

205
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,080
dtn working group uh chaired by keith

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
scott who is here today one of one of

207
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
the topics of conversation in areas of

208
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
overlap uh in these uh two working

209
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,760
groups is how much of the dtn ecosystem

210
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
and the dtn architecture

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
is

212
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
shared across

213
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
space and terrestrial use cases and what

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
pieces of this are specific to space

215
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
constellations uh deep space and near

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
space exploration versus uh those that

217
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
are more general purpose

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
and as you can imagine when we start

219
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
talking about in pieces naming and

220
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
addressing

221
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
quality of service

222
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
resiliency custody transfer and so on

223
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,079
there are questions relating to are

224
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,040
there

225
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
niche cases for space that require their

226
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
own solutions or their general solutions

227
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
across

228
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,160
to that end there is discussion

229
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
about how much of the standards are done

230
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
uh 100 in the ietf as rfcs versus what

231
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
pieces are done in the ccsds as as books

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,240
so sorry for that every primer maybe

233
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
that's already known but

234
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
maybe not everyone online is familiar

235
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
with the ccsds

236
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
but to that end uh ucsds asked if they

237
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
could come to this meeting and spend uh

238
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
10 or 15 minutes and talk through some

239
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
of the areas that they

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
believe exist in an overlap

241
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
and to understand from a working group

242
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
perspective here in the ietf whether we

243
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
agree or disagree with

244
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
with some of that

245
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
so without his introduction

246
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
i would uh invite keith scott uh to join

247
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
in and we can start uh sharing his

248
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
presentation slides and start

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
his set of discussions

250
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
awesome

251
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
can can somebody there push the slide

252
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
yes give me 30 seconds to just queue up

253
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
the next set of slides through meet echo

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
it's normally right

255
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
um it always takes me a moment to find

256
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
the right slides

257
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,160
cool

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
um so while you're doing that uh

259
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
uh

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
some sort of status uh i'm keith scott i

261
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
do you know i chair the the ccsds cis

262
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,839
dtn working group the as ed pointed out

263
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,880
you know

264
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
ccsds

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
is the standards body that is

266
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
responsible for setting standards for

267
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,519
uh civilian space missions and

268
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
interoperability among

269
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
uh sort of a suite of uh space agencies

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
both both national

271
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,279
and and multinational

272
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,240
there

273
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
um

274
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
we

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
we of course are very interested in in

276
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
bundle protocol

277
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
and

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
just finished

279
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
submitting a ccsds profile

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
of bpv7

281
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
to the

282
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
to tomaso to cola who is the

283
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,839
uh

284
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
the space internetworking systems area

285
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
director in ccsds

286
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
uh for standardization the

287
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,240
the the protocol profile there really is

288
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
uh

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
very very much grounded in bp in the

290
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
bpv7 rfc

291
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
uh so the the the profile within ccsds

292
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,079
says

293
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
you know you should you should implement

294
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,079
uh rfc 9171

295
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
uh and then here are some

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
uh

297
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,279
here's here's some clarifications there

298
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
uh you know a couple of restrictions for

299
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
instance uh we wanted to say that uh you

300
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,000
know a compliant ccsds implementation

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
uh didn't necessarily need to deal with

302
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
bundles larger than i think we picked

303
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
like 10 meg

304
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
as a size

305
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
uh just to to give missions sort of an

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,279
out when they're doing implementations

307
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,480
that they you know they don't have to

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
deal with things that are that are

309
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
too large for them to to handle

310
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
um

311
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
and and and then ccsds always wants like

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,519
a service specification so so there's a

313
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,240
service specification the ccsds document

314
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
um

315
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,920
in addition to that we defined a couple

316
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
of convergence layer adapters that are

317
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
useful for

318
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
uh space missions so in particular an

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
ltp convergence layer adapter

320
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
uh where one of the things that we did

321
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,240
there was allowed

322
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
essentially used a type link

323
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,279
you know a

324
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
type value

325
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
pair or length value pair to allow

326
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
multiplexing of multiple bundles into a

327
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
single ltp block

328
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
uh and that of course imposes a

329
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,959
requirement on the receiver that they're

330
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,839
able to parse those out

331
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,720
um but essentially a seabor unsigned

332
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
integer followed by a bundle

333
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
uh cbor unsigned integer followed by a

334
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
bundle to make things work out there

335
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
um

336
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
uh one other thing that is is sort of

337
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
you know

338
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
a working point between i think this

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
between ccsds and the itf

340
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
is is not just sort of where the points

341
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
of overlap are but the timing of various

342
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,959
needs

343
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
ccsds has got a couple of missions now

344
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,000
that are that are using uh bp

345
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,639
uh they're moving out i think pace is is

346
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,240
still looking at

347
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
a version uh that is based on bpv6

348
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
and they did that partially because

349
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,320
they're interested in the beefy the bp

350
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,519
v6

351
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,360
uh custody transfer and reliability

352
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,639
mechanism which is one of the things i'd

353
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,000
like to talk about

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
um

355
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
but in general the you know there may be

356
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,560
you know things that are

357
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
uh

358
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
where there may be times where

359
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
the the sort of the needs timelines of

360
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
ccsds and ietf diverge and and you know

361
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
ed and i talk regularly uh so you know

362
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,920
we sort of understand where where the

363
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
two efforts are going uh but there's a

364
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
strong desire

365
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
from uh from our part and i think for

366
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
meds as well uh

367
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
for

368
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,920
to keep the two efforts in line as much

369
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
as as makes sense uh so if there are you

370
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
know certain things that that we need to

371
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
do from

372
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
uh from a ccsds standpoint

373
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
um

374
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
if if that if we can define a common

375
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,959
mechanism uh that can be used by sort of

376
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
the larger community within the ietf as

377
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
well as ccsds i think that's better

378
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
and will be better for for ccsds in the

379
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
long run

380
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
because with their you know their their

381
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,800
end goal really is to deploy

382
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
bundle protocol as the networking layer

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
for space communications

384
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
and then hopefully someday to go off and

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
buy commercial products for the ground

386
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,519
that that deal with that on the ground

387
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
side and then you know the the various

388
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
space agencies will will always have to

389
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,800
write their own flight implementations

390
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,600
because flight software is as it can can

391
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
tell you its own its own thing

392
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,680
um

393
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
so there are a couple of areas where

394
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,839
as i said we've we've just gotten

395
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,639
through uh dealing with this profile of

396
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
bpv7 uh

397
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,800
as as the i

398
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
as you did uh we pushed a lot of things

399
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,360
off to later

400
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
in order to get an initial specification

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,199
out the door

402
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
uh so things like reliability uh how to

403
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
do accounting

404
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,560
uh

405
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,000
what we're gonna do with with quality of

406
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,199
service all those things we sort of we

407
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,839
we did not try to add on and tackle

408
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,560
those in addition to 9171

409
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
um

410
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
but uh you know the time will will come

411
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
soon and is and sort of is now

412
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,839
where

413
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,920
uh you know we need to turn to those

414
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
those things because those are

415
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
uh the next set of things that that we

416
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
need as well as you

417
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,439
um so i think that in the in the ietf

418
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
dtn uh charter i think that uh

419
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
reliability certainly reliability

420
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
quality of service network management

421
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
are all in your charter and i i sort of

422
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
wonder if

423
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,559
if

424
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
network management might also include

425
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
accounting

426
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,720
there's uh

427
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
so so maybe i'll just go through through

428
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,679
this

429
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,240
uh if i hit the next slide

430
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,000
um

431
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
so

432
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
reliability sort of at the at the bundle

433
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,679
level not necessarily

434
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,559
a series of reliable convergence layers

435
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
um

436
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
the

437
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
you know the some of the goals for

438
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
especially for some of these space

439
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,679
missions is absolutely to be able to

440
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,320
release resources

441
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
as soon as possible

442
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
and

443
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,679
the

444
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,360
while a series of reliable convergence

445
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
layers is a good way to get reliability

446
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
uh there's there is a desire for

447
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,360
something that is a little bit stronger

448
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
than that that is actually signaled at

449
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,840
the bundle layer for dealing with cases

450
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
where

451
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
we may have a link where you just can't

452
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
get a reliable convergence later if

453
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
you've got a unidirectional link

454
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
and there's some

455
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,039
multi-access uh some multiple access

456
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,320
mechanisms

457
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,799
um with tdrs

458
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,559
where you've got unidirectional links

459
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,440
there

460
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
you may end up having

461
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
unidirectional what are essentially

462
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
unidirectional links uh from

463
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,120
various space missions just because of

464
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
the delays and your inability to

465
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
actually turn a signal around to get it

466
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
back out

467
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
uh in in time to sort of close a link

468
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,840
before

469
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
you know you want that ground station

470
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
back and you need the antenna resource

471
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
on earth to go do something else

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
um

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
so the

474
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
you know by the the the vibe custody

475
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
transfer or the vibe draft with custody

476
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
transfer is is a way of providing that

477
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
you know providing the reliability

478
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
mechanism it's signaled um

479
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
there's uh

480
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,799
esa has the european space agency has

481
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,559
expressed a desire

482
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
uh for a capability that is is more akin

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
to the way things were were done in bpv6

484
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,200
where the the bundle carry the the

485
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,799
bundle sort of carried with it natively

486
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
a request

487
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,080
uh for

488
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
uh for a reliability mechanism

489
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
uh esa also has some thoughts that that

490
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,799
sort of blend

491
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,600
uh

492
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
reliability and this accounting notion

493
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
uh together into

494
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
ways that they might be able to do

495
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
uh more beneficia essentially

496
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,600
uh

497
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,919
uh something that that is akin to the

498
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,240
aggregate custody signaling mechanism

499
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
uh that was used in and implemented in

500
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
ion and used for the international space

501
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
station developed developed for iss

502
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
esa is interested in using something

503
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
like that

504
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,200
but but expanded for

505
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,559
maybe to support

506
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
things other than just reliability and

507
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
custody transfer but but also some of

508
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,799
these accounting mechanisms so ways that

509
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,679
you can

510
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,640
send

511
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
signals metadata about bundles in the

512
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
state of the network um

513
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
that are uh that are particularly bid

514
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
efficient there

515
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
um

516
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,439
let's see yeah next one

517
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,559
uh

518
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,760
so so that accounting is really sort of

519
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
uh you know just you know where

520
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
really uh you know where

521
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
where are the bundles and where are the

522
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
resources and how are they being used um

523
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
i in in

524
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,679
we put together these slides

525
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,000
within the working group yeah ed

526
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
sorry i just before we went through

527
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
these i i had a quick question

528
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
which is how do you want to handle

529
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,039
questions do we want to go through all

530
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,360
of these and then have questions at the

531
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,840
end or do we want to talk reliability

532
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
questions about it first and go on to

533
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
the next

534
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,559
um

535
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
we can do questions on reliability now

536
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,039
that worked

537
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,720
do people have such questions

538
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,799
well so my my question uh so there's at

539
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,400
least one question uh because i have a

540
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
question

541
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
is

542
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
when we talk about when we talk about

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
reliability when we talk about this kind

544
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
of custody signaling um

545
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
then

546
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
it seems that there are

547
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,480
two proposals out here for custody

548
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
signaling right one is

549
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,080
is there a custody uh signaling

550
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
mechanism that could be put into an

551
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,400
extension block the other is uh is

552
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,360
custody an artifact of an underlying

553
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
convergence layer like a bb convergence

554
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
layer

555
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
it the

556
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
my question for the working group is do

557
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,919
we believe uh that that those are two

558
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
options that exist uh in parallel or do

559
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
we think that there will be one or the

560
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
other uh are there any thoughts on on

561
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
that

562
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,000
i i so so my thought is you always have

563
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,760
you always have the option of reliable

564
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
convergence layers so it almost can't be

565
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,320
one or the other because you're always

566
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,159
going to have

567
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
the the question is really do you

568
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,760
do you think that you're going to

569
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
architect your network in such a way

570
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
that you always know that you're going

571
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,520
to have that series of reliable

572
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
convergence layers

573
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
well maybe two questions first is do you

574
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,919
need reliability at

575
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,880
the

576
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
do you want

577
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
reliability of

578
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
the network from bundle protocol to be a

579
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
service that's provided

580
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
and and if so do you think that you will

581
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,799
always be able to architect your network

582
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
in such a way that you have uh reliable

583
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,360
convergence layers along the entire path

584
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
over

585
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,200
so can i just jump in in a second

586
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
i joined the queue um

587
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
from my perspective even if you have uh

588
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,679
reliable convergence layers across the

589
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
entire end-to-end path

590
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,320
i still think there has to be

591
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
some signaling somehow at the bundle

592
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
protocol

593
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,720
level to say i need you to use those

594
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
reliable convergence layers in case

595
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,679
you know an individual bpa has a choice

596
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,360
between a reliable and an unreliable

597
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,840
conversions layer at a certain hop along

598
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,080
that that path as the as the bundle

599
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,919
transits so i think it has to be

600
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,280
explicit

601
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
in some way either through bibi or

602
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,799
through having some signaling

603
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,720
conceivably both if there is interest in

604
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
doing both but i think it has to be

605
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,840
explicit it can't just be implied that

606
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,559
oh i have built my network entirely out

607
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
of reliable convergence layers therefore

608
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
everything will be reliable because not

609
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
all traffic needs to be reliable so

610
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
i think that you will solve one specific

611
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
use case but at the ietf i think we need

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,760
to consider slightly more generic

613
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
solutions for some of these things

614
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,640
i think jonathan is up next yeah go on

615
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
jonathan

616
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,320
yeah i just just wanted to

617
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,159
uh add a little bit more to that and

618
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,240
when we talk about the custody signaling

619
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
at the bundle level

620
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,159
we're saying things like we've actually

621
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,760
had the space

622
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
of this resource to store it and that

623
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
the bundle is completely parsed and

624
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
there are no errors or and it's

625
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,039
acceptable you can't get either of those

626
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
kinds of things with a reliable

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
convergence layer

628
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,919
the convergence layer just says i got a

629
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
bunch of bits

630
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,400
um and they're the bits that were sent

631
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
but it doesn't tell you that i was able

632
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
to actually store that bundle or the

633
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,799
bundle parsed completely without errors

634
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,679
or exceptions of any type so that's the

635
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,760
kind of thing in the space community

636
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,679
we're looking for that

637
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
the data is completely intact not being

638
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,600
able to store it and so the previous

639
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
node can now release it say that node is

640
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
a small rover

641
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
that wants to get its uh data reliably

642
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,840
back

643
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,400
and once that is

644
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
the resource is freed on the rover it

645
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
can go about doing its normal thing um

646
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,159
you know capturing more science data or

647
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,679
doing whatever so that's that's one of

648
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,880
the underlying

649
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,720
rationales where we're really interested

650
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
in getting uh

651
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,919
it uh

652
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,159
reliability at the bundle level

653
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
um and i agree with keith in that

654
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
all these are options you know bundle

655
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
level reliability convergence layer

656
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
reliability

657
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,039
are things that we should allow in the

658
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,520
protocol

659
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
go ahead scott

660
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,039
uh just for notice i lock the queue here

661
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,799
because i'm trying to try to keep this

662
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,240
is a really useful discussion about

663
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,840
reliability but i don't want to eat the

664
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,799
entire session about reliability and my

665
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,120
with my chair hat on i think

666
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
much like we're going to tackle naming

667
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,360
and addressing in a slightly

668
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
workshopping manner here i think i'm

669
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
hearing a lot of

670
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,559
opportunity for good discussion about

671
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,039
what do we mean by reliability so uh i

672
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,320
know people have got valid points but

673
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,919
let's let's just cut the queue at this

674
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
point carry on scott and brian just join

675
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
uh right just very briefly to go to your

676
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,440
point uh can you hear me

677
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
the

678
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,400
source application desires to be used

679
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
end-to-end

680
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
is uh one of the things that i think we

681
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,640
ought to consider in quality of service

682
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,559
when we get to the quality of service

683
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,720
conversation

684
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,799
i think that signaling is a useful thing

685
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,480
uh quality of service is something that

686
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
we need to spend some time on anyway

687
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,480
uh and and i agree that uh both uh

688
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
reliable convergence layers

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,799
uh and um

690
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
uh and and reliability

691
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,320
uh uh

692
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
within uh some sort of reliability

693
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,559
mechanism within final protocol using uh

694
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
some sort of extension block are are

695
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
worthwhile things to uh discuss and

696
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
that's all i've got for now

697
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,439
thanks scott go ahead brad

698
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,640
um

699
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,600
i just want to help frame the discussion

700
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
on this last point about the convergence

701
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
player cannot provide this

702
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,120
right now at least

703
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
the

704
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
reliable convention layers the tcpcl and

705
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
the ltpcl

706
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
they could do this but they both are

707
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,559
silent about what the acknowledgement

708
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,960
currently means so either a cc ccsds

709
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
profile of these converters layers can

710
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,919
say that if you acknowledge a transfer

711
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,960
it means it's gone all the way into

712
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,240
the forwarding queue or storage or

713
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,799
whatever that is or an individual

714
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,039
network operator could enforce that

715
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,360
so it is possible for that to have

716
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,640
meaning

717
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,320
it just isn't specified right now

718
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,480
thanks brian go ahead ed

719
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
uh yeah thanks so so rick i was also

720
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,880
about to try and say let's not have this

721
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,600
whole conversation uh here in real time

722
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,919
uh but i i was going to say it seems

723
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,480
like there there may be some energy

724
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
towards perhaps an extension block or

725
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,279
other mechanism uh to signal reliability

726
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,760
and custody so if uh please keep that in

727
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,039
the back of your mind as to whether

728
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
that's work that the ietf should be

729
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,559
handling ccscs should be handling

730
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,840
and then also as we identify custodians

731
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
that's going to take us back into some

732
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,200
of the naming and addressing

733
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
conversation later in this meeting so

734
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,120
please remember that as a use case

735
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,159
brilliant good summary uh

736
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,320
okay carry on scott

737
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
oh sorry keith

738
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
yep

739
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
uh okay uh accounting so

740
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,880
the

741
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,000
uh accounting is a big deal

742
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
in uh in these space missions they very

743
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
much want to know

744
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
uh you know where all of their resources

745
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,840
are being used if there's a question

746
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
about where that data actually is

747
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
sitting right now

748
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,679
uh

749
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,559
they are

750
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,960
for for the space missions

751
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,880
the the difference between a difference

752
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
between

753
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
uh them and the ietf

754
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,840
this is really their first foray into

755
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,679
networking uh they space missions

756
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
currently are are very much run

757
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,039
uh as uh i've got a mission operations

758
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
center i have a link i have a spacecraft

759
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
there's one spacecraft it is the thing

760
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,399
that i talk to

761
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,360
um

762
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,799
so so they're they're quite concerned uh

763
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
about uh understanding

764
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
uh you know did this bundle make it to

765
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
the ground station did it make did it

766
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,960
get radiated did you know did various

767
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,840
things happen with it

768
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,480
um

769
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
so uh you know so some of these

770
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,559
questions are

771
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,559
uh accounting questions you know sort of

772
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
along the lines of of you know what what

773
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,679
might be

774
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,919
uh you know internet or telephony even

775
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,360
accounting right where where are my

776
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,799
resources being used uh where's my data

777
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
um some of some of the stuff that's on

778
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
this slide that's in accounting you know

779
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,880
is is really seems to be more

780
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,679
i is more i think network management

781
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,640
um

782
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,520
so

783
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
you know how much storage is there at a

784
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,159
node

785
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,399
um

786
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,200
so

787
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,880
i i think here

788
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,240
you know there there are sort of a

789
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
couple of things going on one one is

790
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,919
uh you know this desire to to be able to

791
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,760
get insight into

792
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
uh where you know where bundles are have

793
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,399
they made it you know past this node

794
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,760
what's going on

795
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,399
there which will become more and and

796
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,440
more important as we get into sort of

797
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
multinational cooperative networks right

798
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
you know think of

799
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,360
uh you know we're going to have things

800
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,120
that are that are like autonomous

801
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,760
systems where there are some nodes in

802
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,240
this network that are run by nasa and

803
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,039
some that are run by esa and you know as

804
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,799
we all know whenever anything goes wrong

805
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,159
the first thing people do is point at

806
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,600
the network and say oh your network

807
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,880
isn't working right

808
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,039
um and so having the the accounting

809
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,840
mechanisms to be able to to say

810
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,919
where things are is is going to be

811
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,519
important there

812
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,760
um

813
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,880
one question that i have is whether or

814
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,840
not

815
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
well so so so that's that that's one uh

816
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,799
one bit the other the other sort of more

817
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,960
network management or directly network

818
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,480
management bit

819
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,440
is

820
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,519
uh state of nodes

821
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,399
where

822
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,120
uh you you may be asking things like you

823
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
know how much storage does node have how

824
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,600
many you know how many error bundles did

825
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,880
it receive

826
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,799
uh and things like that i think i i

827
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,039
think that a lot of those uh a lot of

828
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,360
those are probably addressable

829
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,320
through

830
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,799
uh something like amp and and having the

831
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,799
right information in some adms that we

832
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,000
can ask for the a big question that i

833
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,080
have is whether or not

834
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,200
the

835
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
sort of the the first of those uh the

836
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,799
the the

837
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,120
the sort of real-time accounting needs

838
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
things that you might get from

839
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,559
uh from the bundle status reports right

840
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,240
so you know we have this bundle status

841
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,600
report mechanism

842
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,760
uh the part of the reason that we don't

843
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,559
really want to use that operationally

844
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,039
is it introduces the the potential for

845
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
there to be a lot of overhead in the

846
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,799
network and and you would have

847
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,240
you might need to carefully craft rules

848
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
saying you know who is going to send

849
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,640
various status reports when

850
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,399
and even if you do that if you're

851
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,919
traversing a chunk of like the

852
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,600
terrestrial internet

853
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,720
uh

854
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,559
then you where where you're not in

855
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,120
control of those uh bundle nodes then

856
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,039
you don't get to say whether whether or

857
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,360
not they will actually generate uh the

858
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,519
status reports and and the fear there is

859
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
not maybe not so much that they that

860
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,200
they won't generate them but that they

861
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
will

862
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
uh and that those status reports then go

863
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,120
back to

864
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,960
you know some you know some space asset

865
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,559
uh and and

866
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,399
chew up a lot of very expensive and

867
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,519
scarce resources on the way there so a a

868
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,760
question that i have is

869
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
you know

870
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
if you look at this slightly differently

871
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,000
i i wonder if if amp and the network

872
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,960
management capabilities might be

873
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
uh

874
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,080
configurable in such a way

875
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
that we could

876
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
use them to generate

877
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
some sort of network management if we

878
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
define the adm the right way some sort

879
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,679
of network management

880
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,720
message

881
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
for

882
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,679
i saw a bundle that looked like this

883
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,840
that went through me

884
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,440
um so

885
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
i'm gonna jump straight in to answer

886
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
that and then i'm gonna let ed probably

887
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,559
answer it much better than me

888
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,639
from my perspective

889
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,639
status reports really are control plane

890
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
inbound signaling really to try and keep

891
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
the bundle forwarding process working

892
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,079
correctly um what you're talking about

893
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,719
here is very much

894
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,280
statistics about the smooth operation of

895
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,159
your

896
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,079
part of the network as a whole which is

897
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,719
a very valid request and needs to exist

898
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,280
it just needs to exist it's sensible so

899
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,918
i would suggest that the the dtn

900
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,119
management

901
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,800
stack would

902
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
absolutely be able to

903
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
uh collect and aggregate these

904
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,399
statistics and and generate them as

905
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,520
reports using uh what was called ama amp

906
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,839
etc

907
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,839
so i there has to be a clear separation

908
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
between we don't just use status reports

909
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,760
and use that as the signaling mechanism

910
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
it's got to be done through that common

911
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,599
management infrastructure which tackles

912
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,400
the

913
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
issues around uh not having that

914
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
end-to-end connectivity at all times

915
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,720
flooding out of traffic intentional

916
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,240
transmission of when that data is

917
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,960
important but i'll i'll let ed

918
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
explain that in much more detail

919
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,320
well so uh exactly right and um what i

920
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,079
just wanted to say here is we we did

921
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,880
have

922
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
uh some of the dtn network management

923
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,000
stuff uh on on charter uh for for this

924
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,880
meeting but uh given that we were two

925
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
hours and not three hours we wanted to

926
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
make sure that naming and addressing uh

927
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,599
went first

928
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
uh generally in itf and ccsds there is

929
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
an understanding that some level of

930
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,680
local autonomy is needed in the

931
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
management plan to do exactly the kind

932
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,280
of things keith that that you're talking

933
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
about which is to make decisions about

934
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
um well ultimately to make decisions

935
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,760
about self-configuration but also to

936
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
understand

937
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,119
when you need to do reporting uh

938
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,960
particularly if you are starting to

939
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
queue and store and forward reports for

940
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,160
others while you don't have connectivity

941
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,240
the area where this may be overlapping

942
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,599
with itf and ccsds or that's the overlap

943
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,960
the area where there might not be

944
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,680
overlapping with the ietf and ccsds are

945
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,640
questions about the on the wire encoding

946
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,000
of of this kind of autonomy model

947
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,119
and so

948
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
there are questions uh that we are

949
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,720
addressing in the dtnma document

950
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,280
the informational rfc around this uh

951
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,760
related to uh whether you know in the

952
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,480
itf do we do we use uh something like

953
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,440
coap uh for the encoding of of these

954
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,680
messages and do we use uh sort of a

955
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
different encoding for areas that that

956
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
don't want to be or can't be running

957
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
co-app and i think that's going to be

958
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,000
sort of the hot topic at the next

959
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
working group meeting and the mailing

960
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,920
list to kind of catch up to it but i

961
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,640
think the autonomy model the data models

962
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,040
associated with it and the use cases for

963
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
what we want to do for this kind of

964
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
accounting and intelligent local

965
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,280
accounting are going to be shared across

966
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
so hopefully that's just a little bit of

967
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,760
a preview

968
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,359
awesome

969
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,320
um

970
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
sorry keith i'll add one last point i

971
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
can i can see a

972
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,800
uh an ops a d in the room

973
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,839
uh so there is a liaison between this

974
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,760
working group and the

975
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
larger network management area within

976
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
the ietf to make sure that we are

977
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,079
fitting in with best practice from the

978
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,200
ietf based on many many years of running

979
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
managing and monitoring networks so

980
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,359
we have access to that that wider depth

981
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,119
of knowledge within the industry so that

982
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,960
we can bring across best practice and

983
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,800
and align

984
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
what we're trying to do we

985
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,119
try and avoid the mistakes

986
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,800
uh that other people have made in other

987
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,680
areas and not just invent our own

988
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,520
processes that miss out some of the

989
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
subtleties so so we have a i think

990
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
that's the one advantage of the ietf is

991
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
that that we have access to this depth

992
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,839
of knowledge in a broader area

993
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,359
so i'm kind of looking at the idea at

994
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,200
the moment saying this is this is where

995
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,680
we will liaise with with you guys to

996
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
make sure our to double check our

997
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,240
homework

998
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,480
uh yeah so robertson cisco opposite d so

999
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,920
yes that's helpful and i think that's

1000
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,760
the right sort of attitude to have and

1001
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
direction so i think um

1002
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
we can certainly try and get the sort of

1003
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,359
cross-pollination reviews and ideas and

1004
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,440
things as necessary and make sure that

1005
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,359
everything's sort of working together as

1006
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,599
possible and reusing bits that we can i

1007
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,880
know there's some different requirements

1008
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
here in terms of handling things and

1009
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,079
things they don't just work the same way

1010
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,000
um but there are some of the areas of

1011
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,920
that which probably can leverage

1012
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
new sensibly

1013
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
brilliant thank you

1014
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,200
carry on keith cool

1015
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,960
awesome um

1016
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
that is that is the bulk of uh of what i

1017
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,000
think we really need to talk about right

1018
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,359
now there's there's a couple other

1019
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,520
things that were on that first slide uh

1020
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,839
relating to qos and priority which we're

1021
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,320
going to talk about later the only other

1022
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,200
item that was there was uh one thing

1023
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,520
that we did within ccsds

1024
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,079
and and sort of

1025
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,560
as a as a as a measure of expediency

1026
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
when we did the bpv7 profile

1027
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,480
we also defined a separate udp cl

1028
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
which is different from the one that's

1029
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,680
in rfc 7122

1030
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,240
essentially just the the dirt simplest

1031
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,320
udpcl that one could come up with

1032
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,119
there's no notion of keep alives it's

1033
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,440
just you know one bundle one udp

1034
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,720
um

1035
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
i i think that for

1036
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
for the

1037
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,040
for the cases that we need you know that

1038
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,920
that will uh that will serve us

1039
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,280
um

1040
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,480
really

1041
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
if there's if there's some need to

1042
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,599
incorporate that into some other

1043
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,640
document then you know obviously

1044
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,200
it's it is it is so simple that

1045
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,240
it hardly bears mention in that case but

1046
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
uh but that does exist in

1047
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
in the context of ccsds for for anybody

1048
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,240
who is interested in it

1049
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,280
so keith on um point i'll just i'll just

1050
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,160
jump in again sorry um i know

1051
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,200
uh brian sipos is looking at updating uh

1052
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
the udpcl uh as a best document i'm

1053
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
interested if he wants to to let us know

1054
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,680
how he's getting on with that but it's

1055
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,960
it's not critical but if ccsds has a

1056
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,200
specific use case for a very ultra

1057
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,160
lightweight cl that they want to quickly

1058
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
knock up specify and standardize that's

1059
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,160
absolutely fine you know it's the nice

1060
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,760
thing about having this this kind of um

1061
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,520
and it isn't a formalized api but that

1062
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,240
kind of separation of of responsibility

1063
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
between the bundle processing in the how

1064
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,079
do i move these bundles between point a

1065
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,680
and point b at the equivalent of the

1066
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,920
link there that's there's no problem if

1067
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,079
you want to liaison and unify onto what

1068
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,440
we're working on and give us input

1069
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,599
that's also fine so i don't think this

1070
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,359
is contentious

1071
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,200
awesome i'll get with brian and figure

1072
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,280
out what he's what he's doing there um

1073
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,760
so we've got back in the cube sorry

1074
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,200
keith let me help you sorry

1075
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
yep

1076
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,119
uh sorry eric flynn illyria i wanted to

1077
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,480
ask um

1078
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,319
the ccsds

1079
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,520
uh udpcl how does it handle mtu issues

1080
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
or are you assuming that you can always

1081
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,680
put a 10 meg udp packet

1082
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,079
yeah we start that you've got to

1083
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,680
fragment the bundle

1084
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,560
in order in order to fit it into

1085
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,119
uh udp datagrams

1086
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,000
uh fragmented at the ib layer then

1087
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,079
fragment at the bundle layer

1088
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,839
at the bottom

1089
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,720
yeah so so essentially we've got a an

1090
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,200
mtu like notion for for for the clas

1091
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,359
or at least from the udp ceiling

1092
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,560
and the mtu is is known administratively

1093
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,599
yeah

1094
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,640
okay

1095
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,400
thank you

1096
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,520
for the for those links um

1097
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
hey uh i'd like to thank you guys uh i

1098
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,520
realize that i've gone way over time

1099
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,280
uh this has been a really useful

1100
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,040
discussion i think for us

1101
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
uh and and my plan is gonna be to just

1102
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,560
work with

1103
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,520
uh with you and and in particular maybe

1104
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,680
through ed uh who also participates in

1105
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,040
the ccsds area stuff and make sure that

1106
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,400
we

1107
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,160
move forward in a way that makes sense

1108
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,400
to everybody

1109
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,319
over

1110
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,880
thank you very much keith i i think that

1111
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,599
was really useful it's um

1112
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,880
i know we have a kind of unofficial

1113
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
liaison with you through uh through ed

1114
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
and various people who participate in

1115
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,440
both events uh i think keeping this

1116
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,240
communication open uh between us and

1117
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
honest between us i think is is good for

1118
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,880
all of us involved so thank you very

1119
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,680
much for for speaking today and uh let's

1120
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,119
keep working together and

1121
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,160
making it all just better okay

1122
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,279
yeah agreed thank you keith

1123
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,359
great so i'm happily sharing slides

1124
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,720
which means i can't see who's up next um

1125
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,319
has somebody got access to ed what's

1126
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,759
next on the agenda because

1127
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,319
certainly uh so next on the agenda we

1128
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,200
have uh brian sipos and uh even though

1129
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
it's listed as two agenda topics there's

1130
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,079
a single consolidated uh slide deck to

1131
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,000
talk about uh three things uh

1132
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,720
administrative records the the cosi uh

1133
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,839
bpsac security context and then uh some

1134
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,319
thoughts on neighbor messaging which

1135
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,400
will then lead us into uh scott which

1136
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,680
will then lead us into naming and

1137
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,119
addressing

1138
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,760
perfect thank you ed um

1139
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,520
go ahead brian

1140
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,839
all right thanks um

1141
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,599
uh all of these topics are going to be

1142
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,280
pretty short i want to

1143
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,040
skip through them and and really get

1144
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,920
feedback that's the goal for uh for

1145
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
presenting this um so the the first

1146
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,599
topic and all of these things have

1147
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,960
roughly been presented previously

1148
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,359
so what i'm trying to do is get a little

1149
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,480
bit of

1150
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
more conclusion on some of these

1151
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,319
so on the topic of the administrative

1152
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,560
record types

1153
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,160
this is roughly the same information as

1154
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,640
presented at the last ietf and the idea

1155
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,720
is that there was a little bit of a a

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,079
gap left

1157
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,119
from rfc in any 171 that

1158
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,640
that there's an iana table of

1159
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,400
administrative record types it was not

1160
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,880
updated for bpv7 and the point of this

1161
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,760
draft is to make those updates

1162
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,599
so that it's consistent with bp v6 and b

1163
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,359
and v7

1164
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,440
and there was another comment to

1165
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
explicitly say that there's no change to

1166
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,240
the

1167
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,040
um registration procedure which is a

1168
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,440
reasonable thing to state it's

1169
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,599
not a change so it's just making sure

1170
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,520
that the reader's aware that there is no

1171
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,200
change

1172
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,560
and

1173
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
uh what it looks like it boils down to

1174
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,640
this updated set of viana tables and

1175
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,480
the kind of feedback that's wanted is

1176
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,280
first

1177
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
uh it would be good to get this

1178
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,880
adopted so this is a

1179
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,240
request for

1180
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,920
a call for adoption

1181
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,079
and also a request for

1182
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:10,960
um

1183
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
assuming it is adopted

1184
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,319
that

1185
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,000
there's comments more comments on the

1186
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,680
document like should this be two tables

1187
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,760
should this be one table more editorial

1188
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,280
things um

1189
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,520
the contents of this are what's already

1190
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
in existence this is not a proposed

1191
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,839
change to any behavior this is just

1192
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,040
reconciling the iana tables with reality

1193
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
uh including the uh

1194
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
aggregate custody signal allocation that

1195
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,839
was made by ccsds but never actually

1196
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,920
rolled back into the in the table

1197
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,800
so

1198
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
just making sure that the whoever reads

1199
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
the table understands what the real

1200
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,640
situation is

1201
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,720
thanks brian i'll take an action here so

1202
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
this is rick i'll take an action here to

1203
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,880
put a working group adoption call onto

1204
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,440
the list after this uh

1205
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
after this session it may not be this

1206
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,160
okay um and we'll just get it in get

1207
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,520
some review on it and get it through

1208
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,880
because by the sound of it it's not

1209
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,960
contentious so i'm hoping we can move

1210
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,200
fast on this thank you

1211
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,760
and it is necessary for future changes

1212
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,440
like adding new uh administrative types

1213
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,760
it'll be necessary eventually and and

1214
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,599
for example reserving the experimental

1215
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,079
range um just isn't there right now

1216
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,680
like for example the the acme document

1217
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,000
and the by document would need code

1218
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,319
points

1219
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,680
uh next topic uh again hopefully short

1220
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,400
uh the cose context

1221
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,880
so this was presented at an earlier ietf

1222
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,119
as well

1223
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,280
and the idea here is that the

1224
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,079
the

1225
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,240
existing rfcs define

1226
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
a default security context that is very

1227
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,640
focused on

1228
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,800
symmetric keyed algorithms

1229
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,119
it does exactly what it needs to do in a

1230
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,960
narrow scope

1231
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,839
but it doesn't handle any uh notion of

1232
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,079
asymmetric heat algorithms or

1233
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,880
more broadly any pki

1234
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,640
integrated security

1235
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,200
this is something that was brought up uh

1236
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
by the ietf sector in the the bpsec

1237
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,839
review and it was also something that

1238
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:16,800
was

1239
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,480
presupposed by

1240
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,520
existing

1241
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,000
uh nasa and

1242
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,079
ioag um future architectures that the

1243
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,680
pki is what's going to be used for

1244
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,599
integrating disparate networks

1245
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,119
and right now there isn't a mechanism to

1246
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,559
do that so this proposal is is saying um

1247
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,280
we want to use this pre-existing

1248
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,160
um

1249
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,400
structure and uh

1250
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,520
and uh

1251
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,119
algorithmic processing

1252
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,880
which is uh cbor object signing

1253
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,559
encryption cose

1254
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,400
and put it into bpsec

1255
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,119
and the idea here is then that uh we're

1256
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,240
gonna embed cos a as a bpsex security

1257
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,079
context uh

1258
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,319
it occupies one code point because

1259
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,760
different cose messages have different

1260
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,440
code points

1261
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,720
that

1262
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,880
they self-distinguish they can be used

1263
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,280
for signing that can be used for

1264
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,119
encrypting

1265
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,079
and

1266
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,200
there's some additional technical

1267
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
details in here for deduplication to

1268
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,559
avoid

1269
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,880
having a lot of duplicate data within

1270
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,680
the

1271
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
the security context data

1272
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
and cose itself is a

1273
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,000
roughly compressed storage

1274
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
of the security data

1275
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,319
and then part of that is

1276
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,000
to propose for this interoperability

1277
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,559
security profile that includes

1278
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,839
um

1279
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,920
symmetric keyed algorithms and then on

1280
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,680
top of that uh asymmetric and also pki

1281
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,800
facing

1282
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
algorithms so the end goal of this is

1283
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,160
that you can just use

1284
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,640
existing

1285
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,839
bpsec

1286
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,599
fundamental structure within a pki

1287
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,359
and with existing tools that handle

1288
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,040
coset

1289
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
so brian rick again uh just a quick

1290
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,880
clarifying question so

1291
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,520
do you have a draft for this and is it

1292
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
because i just have a quick look at the

1293
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,359
data tracker documents has it expired or

1294
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,400
you haven't put it through today

1295
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
it's it's expired yeah

1296
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
right okay so

1297
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,880
your intention is to uh

1298
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,359
send out a new update to to

1299
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,359
reinvigorate it and

1300
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,119
uh ask for working group adoption is

1301
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,720
that the plan

1302
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
basically yes yeah that uh if there's

1303
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
any comments against the existing uh

1304
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,200
behavior uh i'd like to

1305
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,040
i'd like to get some feedback but also

1306
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,720
know that it's feedback that would be

1307
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,319
directed towards a working group

1308
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,520
document

1309
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,319
okay so to that end uh given it's

1310
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,240
expired

1311
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
and you don't uh from what i can hear

1312
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,079
you don't have any edits in order to put

1313
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,960
out a new version can you send a link to

1314
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,800
where it lives because it's difficult to

1315
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,559
find it through the data tracker as a

1316
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,920
cache sure working group attendee so

1317
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,520
just to say it's here please can i have

1318
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,839
some review and uh we'll try and

1319
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,599
reinvigorate it and get it adopted from

1320
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,599
that point or whatever okay

1321
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,079
okay and there are potential minor edits

1322
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:10,800
like

1323
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
the rfc 9173

1324
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,400
changed its definition of aad and this

1325
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,800
the idea is this would be updated to be

1326
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,559
consistent with that we want to make as

1327
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,000
few amount of you know changes as

1328
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,319
possible well that might be a really

1329
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,319
convenient way to reinvigorate it is if

1330
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,680
you want to change one or two small

1331
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,319
things push out a a new version it'll

1332
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,319
become live back in the data tracker

1333
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,240
easier for people to find and we can we

1334
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,599
can do the working group adoption call

1335
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,720
at that point

1336
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,279
go ahead okay

1337
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,800
so so uh a few things uh one uh without

1338
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,559
my chair hat on i just wanted to say

1339
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,880
that i'm i'm personally supportive of

1340
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,200
the work and i think that getting uh

1341
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,079
some additional bp sec security contacts

1342
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,160
defined is a great way of starting to

1343
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,119
think through uh how how we use and the

1344
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,680
possibilities for the bpsec

1345
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,400
protocol itself i also know that there

1346
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,800
are security context being talked about

1347
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,839
as being standardized in ccsds my with

1348
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,119
my chair head on uh my question is

1349
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,800
uh has anyone in the uh cosi environment

1350
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,319
uh reviewed this document uh and um

1351
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,319
could we between now and the next ietf

1352
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,079
if they haven't been able to review it

1353
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,559
could we get a quick review of it uh

1354
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,480
maybe as rick suggested after a minor

1355
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,800
edit to resurrect the document uh so

1356
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,119
that going into 115

1357
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,200
we know that uh we've gotten that extra

1358
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,520
review

1359
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,559
sure um i had

1360
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,040
sorry brian ed i'm gonna just i think

1361
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
for before we can reach out to the

1362
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,240
kosair group i think it's probably worth

1363
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,079
us adopting it first because it seems a

1364
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,640
bit odd to us to coset

1365
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,400
guys to have a look at something that's

1366
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,000
an individual draft i think it will be a

1367
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,920
lower priority for them but i think we

1368
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,839
can move fast but i think it's valid to

1369
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:00,880
get

1370
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
early review on this view

1371
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,760
so so i completely agree and i

1372
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,920
personally i'm happy with adopting uh

1373
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,520
this document as a working group

1374
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,000
document

1375
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,000
okay in the past i had brought it up i

1376
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,640
believe on the jose mailing list and and

1377
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
like rick had said um just as an

1378
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,440
individual draft it wasn't very

1379
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,599
much of a focus for anybody on that list

1380
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,800
cool let's let's move on brian

1381
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,319
okay uh

1382
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,839
so those two

1383
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,079
topics were more uh focused and more

1384
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,119
concrete uh requesting of of adoption uh

1385
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,319
this next topic is more speculative and

1386
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,400
more asking for comments

1387
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,599
um

1388
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,240
and it's a bit of a broader topic so

1389
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,440
the the general topic is in uh neighbor

1390
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,200
messaging and more specifically neighbor

1391
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
discovery in support of one of the

1392
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,440
working group

1393
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,160
charter items

1394
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,920
and uh

1395
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,359
the current charter has

1396
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,400
neighbor peer discovery as a milestone

1397
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
there's an existing experimental draft

1398
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,160
from the irtf called ipnd

1399
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,720
that does its job in a narrow scope and

1400
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,440
it

1401
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,760
lacks some things that

1402
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,440
a full on

1403
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,000
standard track protocol would have uh

1404
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,800
like

1405
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,880
extensibility and security

1406
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,839
and what this uh

1407
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,040
proposal is uh pulling together

1408
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,720
is to be able to say

1409
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,760
uh

1410
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,839
we want to not have to reinvent

1411
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,280
extensibility not have to reinvent

1412
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,599
security and reinvent some of these

1413
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,480
things

1414
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,760
so

1415
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,359
the idea is that

1416
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,480
we want to

1417
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,079
make use of what's already present in

1418
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,720
the in the bpa and

1419
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,839
bpsec

1420
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,960
so the idea here is that

1421
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,800
bpsec already provides a way of doing

1422
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,400
message authentication

1423
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,280
and potentially in the future uh signing

1424
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,839
and bp already provides things like

1425
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,040
lifetime limitation hop limitation

1426
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,800
and convergence layers already provide

1427
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,640
things like a

1428
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,119
unicast transfer or multicast transfer

1429
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,520
and so the idea of this is saying that

1430
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,960
there is this new thing called the

1431
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,240
neighbor message

1432
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,720
and it is a bundle with a specific

1433
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,240
bundle destination

1434
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,960
and it has a certain amount of security

1435
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,319
it has to be applied

1436
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,000
but it's not

1437
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,559
proposing new mechanisms just

1438
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,640
mandating uh uses of existing mechanisms

1439
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,079
so

1440
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,920
i'm going to skip through a little bit

1441
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,559
of content uh just for the sake of

1442
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,040
getting to some feedback if there is any

1443
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,480
but the idea here is that

1444
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,559
a neighbor is

1445
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,599
a one hop destination uh it's some

1446
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,359
peer that's directly reachable through a

1447
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,799
convergence layer

1448
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,839
and what is being proposed here is

1449
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,359
a new well-known uh endpoint in the same

1450
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,680
way that dtn none is a well-known

1451
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,880
endpoint to mean anonymous or the lack

1452
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,040
of uh an endpoint

1453
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
this proposes dtn neighbor

1454
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,440
as a non-specific destination

1455
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,799
and

1456
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,119
that would mean that the bpa knows how

1457
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,200
to handle this endpoint and knows how to

1458
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,599
process uh it in ways that need to be

1459
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,559
done to uh to do neighbor messaging

1460
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,880
and then the idea is that the contents

1461
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,520
of the the payload are

1462
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,400
a map with some labels defined similar

1463
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,040
to existing protocols that you see bore

1464
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,440
and also falls in line with the way

1465
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,000
manet uses

1466
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,760
its own

1467
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,400
packet and messaging format

1468
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,200
and

1469
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
this would say

1470
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
use these existing bundle lifetime

1471
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
previous node hot count blocks to

1472
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,520
control processing don't invent any new

1473
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,839
extension blocks here

1474
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:00,720
and

1475
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,720
the idea is that it would be doing the

1476
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,920
same

1477
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,200
as a starting point it would be doing

1478
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,440
the same kind of job as ipnd but it

1479
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
would take advantage of these

1480
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,599
new capabilities

1481
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,200
that have come since ipnd

1482
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,200
go ahead ronald

1483
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,559
uh

1484
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,319
so we're blessed to have a a many

1485
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,640
working group chair here to uh to to

1486
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,760
offer some feedback hello uh ron enfeld

1487
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,880
uh yes i'm a manager but this is a

1488
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,400
more uh

1489
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,559
heads-off comment

1490
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,960
so um

1491
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,760
if i understand you correctly then you

1492
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,160
have to use always there always has to

1493
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,280
be a udpcl present to do this

1494
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,920
so uh

1495
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,720
depending on the use case

1496
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,760
yes

1497
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,400
and what that means is that uh it's

1498
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,240
described a little bit in some of these

1499
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,160
comments uh let me see if i can find it

1500
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,119
here

1501
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,760
there is a slide that talks about uh the

1502
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,920
convergence layers but in a in a open uh

1503
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,599
network where you don't know anything

1504
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,960
about what's happening

1505
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,559
you would need to use

1506
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,680
something like multicast udp messaging

1507
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,359
to be able to send a message but if

1508
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,040
you're operating in a more controlled

1509
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,680
environment say where you have

1510
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,240
specific links that are advertised by

1511
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,760
something like dlip

1512
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,960
then what you can then do is you can say

1513
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,440
uh well when a link comes up

1514
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,280
probe that specific peer

1515
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,319
and it would be a network configuration

1516
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,920
to be able to

1517
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,480
to set things up in a way that you you

1518
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,559
administratively know uh what kind of

1519
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,839
convergence layers are going to be

1520
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,079
present on the network but

1521
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,000
in a general network yes you would need

1522
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,599
to use udp

1523
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,000
multicast but in a

1524
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,960
controlled network it wouldn't

1525
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,760
necessarily be that way

1526
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,599
so it's not a universal solution and

1527
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,359
there's still a place for something like

1528
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:03,359
ipnd or or something similar

1529
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,680
uh it could be the idea is that the

1530
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,359
hello

1531
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,920
uh message would would cover the same

1532
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,760
ground as ipnd

1533
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,920
that that's the intent is that

1534
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,599
it's it's ipnd plus the ability to do

1535
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,400
uh

1536
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,559
integrity signing and um

1537
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,440
some other aspects

1538
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,799
okay

1539
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,160
thanks

1540
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,558
go ahead skull

1541
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,880
i i like this idea a lot uh

1542
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,720
the convergence layer

1543
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,760
um

1544
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,160
uh aspect of it i i think is still

1545
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,160
it doesn't seem quite right in my mind

1546
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,440
what i'm

1547
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,599
thinking is that um

1548
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,720
these

1549
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,680
um

1550
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,079
conveying these messages in bundles

1551
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,000
is cool because it would

1552
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,520
get the right information to the bundled

1553
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,799
protocol agent

1554
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,079
um

1555
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,280
uh i think it would be

1556
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,920
uh simpler and cleaner maybe

1557
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,799
to

1558
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,839
um

1559
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:10,720
to add

1560
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,480
something additional here which is

1561
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,559
essentially a discovery

1562
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,960
uh convergence layer adapter

1563
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,400
that has

1564
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,440
any number of of uh of different

1565
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,119
underlying

1566
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,319
link service adapters of its own so that

1567
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,480
bundle protocol doesn't have to

1568
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,720
like deal with a million different

1569
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,640
things in order to handle these things

1570
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,240
and i'm thinking here of of ltp as a as

1571
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,240
a model we run

1572
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,920
ltp over

1573
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,760
udp we can run it over space protocols

1574
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,040
and and all of that complexity is

1575
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,119
um protocol shielded from all of that

1576
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,920
stuff

1577
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,920
uh by the standard

1578
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,040
ltp

1579
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,040
uh protocol functionality i think we had

1580
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,760
a

1581
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,599
a neighbor discovery

1582
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,599
uh convergence layer

1583
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,000
adapter that

1584
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,400
that shielded bp from

1585
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,319
the details of

1586
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,040
how something is going to talk to it

1587
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,319
then

1588
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,480
bp could stay simpler

1589
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,400
the convergence layer

1590
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,359
um

1591
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,680
uh structure for the network would be

1592
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,680
simpler and then

1593
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,599
and the

1594
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,079
link service adapters underneath this

1595
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,000
uh neighbor discovery

1596
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,119
uh convergence layer uh protocol could

1597
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,359
be adapted to whatever the uh the uh

1598
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,160
the

1599
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,040
uh

1600
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,839
the network that the sub network that

1601
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,839
that one that the node lives in uh can

1602
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,920
sustain um so i would like to

1603
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,319
propose that we

1604
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,680
interpose a

1605
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,880
a new

1606
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
uh neighbor discovery convergence layer

1607
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,000
protocol

1608
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,040
to convey these messages

1609
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,200
thanks scott um i my comment is i'm i'm

1610
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,400
afraid i'm going to disagree with you

1611
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,920
scott i

1612
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,440
i don't think this needs a new

1613
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,280
convergence there and i like this i

1614
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,440
think what i think is the most elegant

1615
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,280
part of this apart from yeah we need a

1616
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,040
standardized way of passing around the

1617
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,960
neighbor messages and yes manet has done

1618
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,559
a lot of work in this area and there's a

1619
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,079
wealth of experience we can look at

1620
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,040
there

1621
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:17,760
the

1622
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,319
the dtn colon tilde neighbor i think

1623
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,319
that's very clever

1624
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,200
so you've you can formulate a bundle and

1625
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,119
address it to i need to address this to

1626
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,520
my one hop neighbors and then leave the

1627
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,200
internal implementation of the bundle

1628
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,040
processing agent to say

1629
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,000
i know how to resolve that name to

1630
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,920
whatever convergence layers i'm running

1631
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,599
and whatever those convergence layers

1632
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,119
understand by

1633
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,040
how to get things to a one-hop neighbor

1634
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,880
i you know oh i'm running d-lab on a

1635
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,319
couple of these uh

1636
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,480
physical interfaces and i know i'm going

1637
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,680
to run a

1638
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,960
i've been pre-configured to run a

1639
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,400
certain uh cla on top of that so i can

1640
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,799
use that signaling to say oh now i can

1641
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,640
transmit this bundle to my one hop

1642
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,599
neighbor

1643
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,280
and equally you could have some kind of

1644
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,599
udpcl which understands broadcast and

1645
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,359
you can you can do that

1646
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,760
or you can have some non-broadcast

1647
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,960
multi-access overlay tunneled thing

1648
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,160
or ldp or whatever and

1649
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,559
yes there would have to be a per cla

1650
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,319
understanding but that's part of the

1651
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,640
name resolution

1652
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,000
mechanisms

1653
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,799
to say i've got a name called

1654
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,559
all my one hop neighbors

1655
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,960
and i know how to resolve that to get it

1656
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,599
to all my one hop neighbors

1657
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,119
so i'm kind of turning this into a

1658
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,640
naming and addressing topic i think

1659
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,079
and that is why i brought this up

1660
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,760
originally under the naming and

1661
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,200
addressing

1662
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,079
yeah

1663
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,400
go ahead eric uh yeah eric klein lyria i

1664
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,160
forgive my ignorance on on a bunch of

1665
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,599
the stuff but i was thinking along the

1666
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,440
lines of of kind of

1667
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,960
uh what you were saying rick i think

1668
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,400
there would be no problem to just like

1669
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,319
request a link local multicast address

1670
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,480
that represents all dtn nodes

1671
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,079
uh and then you can put it in a udp

1672
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,400
message to that uh you know if you have

1673
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,119
a if you have unicast destinations that

1674
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,720
you know like you already have a cl a

1675
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,079
convergence layer attached then you can

1676
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,319
send the message as if it were unicasted

1677
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,240
if you want to do a multicast just

1678
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,039
ask for a multicast link local prefix

1679
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,760
for v4 and v6 and away you go

1680
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,680
and the intent of this is also that a

1681
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,880
smart

1682
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,359
a smart bpa is going to be able to do a

1683
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,000
lot of complicated things but a dumb bpa

1684
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,319
can just follow some interoperability

1685
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,839
profile and do very simple things

1686
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,599
thanks brian uh have you got anything

1687
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,680
wrong

1688
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,920
i have some other slides that i can skip

1689
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,799
over for the sake of the details but

1690
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,960
there is a separation between

1691
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,240
i'll just mention the separation between

1692
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,240
this hello message content which mimics

1693
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,680
the kind of uh

1694
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,280
content of a hello

1695
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,480
uh uh

1696
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,160
nhdp

1697
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,880
kind of manet message that just says

1698
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,359
here's who i am here's my identities

1699
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,039
here's some cryptographic binding of

1700
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,440
them those identities here are the cl's

1701
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,359
that i'm actively uh using here the

1702
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,240
seals i'm listening on i'm here like the

1703
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,079
the idea is that this is uh more

1704
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,160
extensible content and there can be

1705
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,160
again an interoperability minimum for

1706
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,760
this thing but the idea is that

1707
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,000
definitely it's a place to put

1708
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,039
vendor

1709
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,880
and

1710
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,119
specialized extensions to expose

1711
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,799
whatever needs to be exposed for doing

1712
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,000
um handshaking

1713
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,319
go ahead

1714
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,880
and i i just wanted to call attention to

1715
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,599
um a comment that that ronald had put

1716
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,960
into the chat which is that nhdp is

1717
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,760
about two hop neighbors and i wanted uh

1718
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,599
just to clarify that that brian what

1719
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,000
we're talking about here are our one hop

1720
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,760
uh neighbors your your immediate

1721
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,359
neighbors and that we're not trying to

1722
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,000
establish a two-hop neighborhood in a

1723
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,480
dtn which which may be a difficult thing

1724
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,799
to do

1725
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,440
yes yeah

1726
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,280
so brian second question so i've

1727
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,599
prompted by eric slightly is have you

1728
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,160
got this as a individual draft in any

1729
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,160
form are you in the process of writing

1730
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,680
this up

1731
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,000
no so it exists i'll there's a link at

1732
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,559
the last uh page

1733
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,839
this this link exists as a

1734
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,280
standalone not data tracker document it

1735
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,760
it has missing sections it's not

1736
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,119
complete

1737
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,839
this was put together as a

1738
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,440
kind of a touchstone of is this

1739
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,920
worthwhile um without spending too much

1740
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,960
time on the

1741
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,720
details that have to be present for it

1742
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,039
to be a full document

1743
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,680
but if there's enough interest then

1744
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,880
yeah

1745
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
so so my question is

1746
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,000
this is

1747
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,640
on charter at the moment uh are you

1748
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,720
looking for collaborators to

1749
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,400
uh because i i noticed this would be

1750
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,119
your third id you would be committing to

1751
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,119
uh get ready uh

1752
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,640
i'm looking at people like ronald who

1753
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,559
has has previously expressed a real

1754
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,880
interest in labor discovery but i i know

1755
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,760
this has had some discussion amongst uh

1756
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,680
today and i know people have talked

1757
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,799
about this before

1758
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,280
um would you like some collaborators to

1759
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,480
help make this

1760
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,480
uh move forward

1761
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,720
yes definitely

1762
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,440
okay

1763
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,799
um sorry to push on time but uh

1764
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,319
go ahead ronald you're in the queue

1765
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,160
i would certainly be willing to review

1766
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,039
what whatever you write i cannot really

1767
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,440
commit to

1768
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,039
contributing a lot of text at the moment

1769
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,039
but i will review okay

1770
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,200
and it it really only exists as a

1771
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,839
concept right now it's not been

1772
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,920
at all work done to an actual detailed

1773
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,039
level

1774
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,119
but if you if you are able to access the

1775
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,559
pdf

1776
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:55,760
from the

1777
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,160
data tracker then this link will yield

1778
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,520
you a

1779
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,319
document to read

1780
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,880
okay uh

1781
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,240
is that it wrong are you happy with that

1782
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,440
yes

1783
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,200
perfect thank you very much in which

1784
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,280
case we'll move swiftly on to scott who

1785
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,000
i think is just going to kind of tee up

1786
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,640
the the second hour of this session by

1787
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,160
going into naming and addressing and

1788
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,160
hopefully that will set us up with some

1789
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,000
topics ed i know you've got a sort of

1790
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,160
rough outline for

1791
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,680
for some

1792
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,119
topics to discuss as part of the

1793
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,160
workshop

1794
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,480
um which i think we may naturally slide

1795
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,200
into off the back of of uh scott's

1796
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,760
presentation but uh just to reassure you

1797
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,200
we have a a soft agenda for the uh for

1798
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,799
the second hour but we'll start with

1799
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:47,680
scott

1800
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,000
thanks brian

1801
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,440
um okay shall i start

1802
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,640
go ahead and you have control of the

1803
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,000
slides as well scott okay oh oh i've uh

1804
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,640
how do i advance the slides if you float

1805
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,319
your mouse down to the bottom of where

1806
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,680
it shows on the screen a little

1807
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,078
semicolon

1808
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,799
okay i'll try to go quickly because i

1809
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:23,960
know we're running short on time um

1810
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,960
what i will uh assert here is a couple

1811
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,880
of of definitions that people will

1812
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,520
undoubtedly take issue with later on uh

1813
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,198
i'm gonna assert that

1814
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,679
uh a name is a character string that

1815
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,319
identifies a thing of some sort then

1816
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,399
distinguishing it from other things of

1817
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,880
the same type so you have a type you

1818
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,719
have scientists well they're the names

1819
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,080
that distinguish different scientists

1820
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,560
might be for example max plunk uh murray

1821
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,439
curry

1822
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,359
the names of things that are of type

1823
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,600
movie you might have for example citizen

1824
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,679
kane the godfather

1825
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,040
um

1826
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,439
location is a type of thing it's a

1827
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,040
different thing from

1828
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,799
uh from a state machine it is a point in

1829
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,040
some sort of space so for example the

1830
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,399
pyramid of khufu

1831
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,319
resides at some point in

1832
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,479
the space defined by the latitude and

1833
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,198
longitude on the surface of earth

1834
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,120
the state machine that is driving this

1835
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,960
particular display is

1836
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,198
it resides in uh

1837
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,040
in a space that is

1838
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,080
the the internet which is uh

1839
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,640
located by its connectivity to other

1840
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,040
state machines that the topology of the

1841
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,399
network

1842
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,439
um an address is the name

1843
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,279
of a location

1844
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,560
uh a node is a state machine that

1845
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,158
resides at some location or network

1846
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,880
nodes and names of nodes and names of

1847
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,759
locations are both names and they're

1848
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,319
typically associated because a node

1849
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,440
typically resides at some location in a

1850
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,800
network

1851
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,520
the name of the location needs to be

1852
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,360
unique within the network

1853
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,480
um

1854
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,840
in order to

1855
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,400
associate it with a node

1856
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,600
um

1857
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,320
the

1858
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,840
the node has a name and that name also

1859
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,520
needs to be unique among

1860
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,600
nodes in order for

1861
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,640
messages to be directed to that node and

1862
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,520
rather

1863
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,480
rather than to some other node

1864
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,199
among the properties of a node are the

1865
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,560
node's name

1866
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,840
and its address which is the name of its

1867
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,440
location and at any moment there's an

1868
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,199
association between

1869
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:37,040
the name of a node and the address of

1870
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,719
the node which is

1871
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,600
the name of the node's location if the

1872
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,480
node's location never changes then you

1873
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,159
can sort of take a shortcut you can use

1874
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,280
the address as the name for example

1875
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,639
if you send a letter to

1876
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,960
the white house it'll go to the

1877
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,560
president of the united states you don't

1878
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,239
have to say this is to the president

1879
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,480
it's the location is enough

1880
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,040
if the location does change

1881
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,560
then um

1882
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,760
then the association between the name of

1883
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,040
the node

1884
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,080
and the name of the location of the node

1885
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,600
has to be recorded somewhere and you

1886
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,040
have to revise it

1887
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,080
when the

1888
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,480
location changes

1889
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,440
um in order for data to

1890
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,800
be sent through a network which is

1891
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,560
actually what we're saying there is it's

1892
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,960
copied from one node in the network to

1893
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,520
another node in the network

1894
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,760
the data has to first arrive at the

1895
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,600
location

1896
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,920
at which the destination node resides

1897
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,520
and then be delivered to the node at

1898
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,679
that location and we do that by

1899
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,040
forwarding

1900
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,360
the message along a route

1901
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,520
which is a

1902
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,239
continuous succession of of connections

1903
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,600
between

1904
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,440
neighbors which are nodes whose

1905
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,159
locations are topologically adjacent

1906
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,719
their locations are connected

1907
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,120
that's what being a neighbor is really

1908
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,800
in the internet

1909
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,159
the ip network locations of nodes

1910
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,440
change

1911
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,360
don't change often and the propagation

1912
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,360
of information about those changes is

1913
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,719
really rapid

1914
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,040
so the source no

1915
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,199
source of sending data to some

1916
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,159
destination node its knowledge of the

1917
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,920
destination node's

1918
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,960
address

1919
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,840
can be used to direct the forwarding of

1920
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,280
the packets that are destined for that

1921
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,560
note because

1922
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,320
the the

1923
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,040
the source node's uh knowledge of the

1924
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,880
address of the destination node is

1925
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,159
likely to be correct it the the the

1926
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,080
location of the destination changes in

1927
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,480
frequently and if it does change you

1928
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,120
find out about it pretty much right away

1929
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,640
so the number of packets that are

1930
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,800
forwarded on this basis

1931
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,920
along obsolete routes is not significant

1932
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,960
you don't have to worry about it

1933
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,040
happening in the internet

1934
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,280
in d10 that's different in dtn the vp

1935
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,280
locations of nodes

1936
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,760
may change often and

1937
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,360
in particular the propagation of

1938
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,520
information about those changes may be

1939
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,000
really slow so the source node's current

1940
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,960
knowledge

1941
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,760
of

1942
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,560
the

1943
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,360
address of the destination node

1944
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,080
is less safely used to direct the

1945
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,159
forwarding bundles destined for the node

1946
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,239
the forwarding may take so long

1947
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,400
that the node has changed location

1948
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,080
before the packets can be delivered

1949
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,159
this is where we get the idea of late

1950
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,000
binding uh

1951
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,760
and in

1952
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,840
the the the problem here is that

1953
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,440
information about a change in a

1954
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,280
destination node's location may be

1955
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,120
getting propagated through the network

1956
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,199
but hasn't made it all the way to the

1957
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,719
source node it may be

1958
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,880
only part way along the

1959
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,280
the path to the to the source node some

1960
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,719
other node may have

1961
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,199
uh the most current information and so

1962
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,080
for this reason what we do in dtn

1963
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,520
forwarding and when we're forwarding a

1964
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,920
bundle is we use the destination node's

1965
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,800
name to look up its address because it

1966
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,719
could be different from what the source

1967
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,800
node might have thought it was so this

1968
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,760
is late binding

1969
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,080
so

1970
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,800
for this reason the destination

1971
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
that we encode into a bundle

1972
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,480
really needs to indicate that the

1973
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,320
destination node's name

1974
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,080
rather than its address the name is

1975
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,159
always going to be reliable it's going

1976
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:23,600
to the node's not going to change its

1977
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,320
name

1978
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,840
that's its identity

1979
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,239
the destinations the address of the

1980
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,120
destination node may not be reliable at

1981
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,719
the time the bundle is sent

1982
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,120
we can imagine um

1983
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,920
mitigating this constraint a little bit

1984
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,640
by saying suppose you've got like large

1985
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,600
areas of the network topology

1986
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,280
that nodes

1987
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,040
may move around within but they don't

1988
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,800
really change from one region to another

1989
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,320
so for example

1990
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,760
similar to uh

1991
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,960
um

1992
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,840
i live in uh los angeles um i might move

1993
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,440
to san diego but that's all california

1994
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,440
or it's all the united states so uh

1995
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,320
the

1996
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,840
if you if you uh uh address

1997
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,360
um

1998
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,000
um if you add for example

1999
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,280
uh the the name of this large region

2000
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,360
like um uh

2001
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,560
uk

2002
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,000
uh to the destination of something well

2003
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,040
that

2004
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,480
that part of the

2005
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,040
uh the resolved location

2006
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,320
of a node

2007
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,800
is unlikely to change very much uh and

2008
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,040
if it does change you may find out about

2009
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,199
it uh you know soon enough to

2010
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,320
be able to uh uh correct for that

2011
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,600
so

2012
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,719
that would

2013
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,640
limit the scope of

2014
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,679
the location lookout the late binding

2015
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,640
function

2016
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,800
uh to to be

2017
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,760
within

2018
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,719
that broad region and that that could

2019
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,440
simplify some things so

2020
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,920
um in that context supposing we have

2021
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,239
that kind of mechanism uh

2022
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,199
how do you get it to the edge of the the

2023
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,320
destination nodes region how do you

2024
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,640
how do you get it across the region

2025
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,199
uh boundaries until it gets to the

2026
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,840
region within which you know the

2027
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,040
decimation node resides somewhere

2028
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,159
um

2029
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,120
and the the region concept that

2030
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,520
that we've been working with in iom

2031
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,480
recently is uh suppose they have got

2032
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,239
multiple regions each region has a name

2033
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,560
if region has a location same as a node

2034
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,159
has our location

2035
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,640
uh the the location of the region is

2036
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,120
within a a tree of regions uh um

2037
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,560
you can think of it as a network of

2038
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,679
regions and there are passageway nodes

2039
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,000
that connect the nodes of of one region

2040
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,520
to the nodes of of

2041
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,840
adjacent in those neighboring regions

2042
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,120
and and those are

2043
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,679
these are nodes that are uh

2044
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:08,800
located

2045
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,600
and they have locations within um both

2046
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,000
of the the uh the two

2047
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,280
uh neighboring regions so a bundle in

2048
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,040
that case can reach the destination

2049
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,400
nodes region by being forwarded from one

2050
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,760
passageway to another through the tree

2051
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,560
um so how do you know which passenger

2052
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,640
forward bundle two in order to get it to

2053
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,640
its destination yeah rick

2054
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,239
scott can i ask a clarifying question

2055
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:35,679
here sure

2056
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,840
i i completely understand but i think i

2057
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,800
completely understand what you're

2058
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,960
discussing here and and there are two

2059
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,480
ways to view it and i'm interested to

2060
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,400
see which way you're looking at it

2061
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,880
one is to say this is effectively

2062
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,600
subnetting so i'm saying

2063
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,679
uh although there is mobility amongst

2064
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:52,640
the

2065
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,120
the nodes within a certain

2066
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,320
space within my topology it's reasonably

2067
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,040
localized so i can make a

2068
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,000
a a rough decision to say it's going to

2069
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,920
be down that side of the tree headed

2070
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,000
over into that region

2071
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,360
and you'll find it over there so the

2072
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,840
later lookups will will

2073
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,920
with more accuracy find it

2074
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,920
so that's that's what i would call

2075
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,159
subnetting the other question is if you

2076
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,920
look at it from an addressing

2077
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,600
perspective

2078
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,360
are these regions

2079
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,080
individually

2080
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,480
sorry as a naming perspective are these

2081
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,960
re do these regions have different

2082
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,719
naming schemes and are those names

2083
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,760
handed out by different authorities that

2084
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,159
have a loose agreement between them at

2085
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,040
these

2086
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,920
um passageways

2087
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,480
so once uh

2088
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,159
can we come back to that question in a

2089
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,800
little bit okay

2090
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,280
right because

2091
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,080
i i i

2092
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,679
think it's something i want to

2093
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,360
dig into a little bit more so that i

2094
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,679
understand it better um

2095
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,520
because i don't see an issue but there

2096
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,400
may very well be one

2097
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,600
do you want to take do you want to take

2098
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,040
more questions or

2099
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,159
i've interrupted because we've got

2100
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:11,440
marketing oh uh no i think yeah sure uh

2101
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,759
mark

2102
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,280
hey can you hear me

2103
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,280
uh yes

2104
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,440
uh okay so can you go back a couple

2105
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,800
slides let's just have a quick question

2106
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,080
about something

2107
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,880
that you said um about the

2108
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,640
regions

2109
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,360
yeah um

2110
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,000
how far back

2111
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,199
uh i think one more

2112
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,199
maybe one more

2113
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,320
anyways i don't know where it was but my

2114
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,520
question is is this um so

2115
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,840
if at some point science one of the

2116
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,000
slides you you seem to imply that within

2117
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,960
a region notes don't change much

2118
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,000
um

2119
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,719
so

2120
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,960
if that is located

2121
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,120
what i what i thought i said was that

2122
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,480
within a region

2123
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,320
the location of a node might change a

2124
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,159
lot but it

2125
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,199
but it might not change from one one

2126
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,639
region to another

2127
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,040
region very often

2128
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,960
oh i see

2129
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,800
so late binding is needed within a

2130
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,600
region because you do you do assume that

2131
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,920
it moves then the location of the node

2132
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,679
moves within the region

2133
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:28,960
yes

2134
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,120
okay that was it thank you

2135
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,520
oh okay

2136
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,920
um let me pick up we're

2137
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,040
okay

2138
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,400
um

2139
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,719
all right so um

2140
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,800
so so if you if you have this and i i

2141
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,600
think

2142
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,880
at the moment i'm

2143
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,040
working with something that is

2144
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,239
that that

2145
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,159
rip is identifying as as a subnetting um

2146
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,719
notion of of of regions

2147
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:55,679
um

2148
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:56,719
so

2149
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,800
one one way to make that work is to have

2150
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,600
management of the region if you have a

2151
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,360
global authority that manages the region

2152
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,400
tree

2153
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,679
and announce

2154
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,199
the the

2155
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,480
region tree topology to every new node

2156
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,600
when the new node is is instantiated and

2157
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,840
communicate changes in the region tree

2158
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,239
topology to all the nodes in the network

2159
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,639
so that every network knows

2160
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,040
the topology of

2161
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,520
the region tree

2162
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,719
there is a

2163
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:29,679
uh

2164
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,480
the the downside to this is that there

2165
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,159
is a uh

2166
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,000
a tree management and

2167
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,520
synchronization

2168
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,719
um

2169
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,639
uh challenge there

2170
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,639
which as usual

2171
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,199
is subject to the usual kinds of of uh

2172
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,239
political problems and is exacerbated by

2173
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,800
the latencies and propagation but but

2174
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,360
it's a familiar sort of thing so we we

2175
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,880
do something like that in the internet

2176
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,120
it's just slower

2177
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,159
um

2178
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,520
uh-huh

2179
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,040
oh sorry i just wanted to call attention

2180
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,960
we do have another question in the queue

2181
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,360
so i wanted to not get too far ahead oh

2182
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,719
yeah sure

2183
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,360
so john go ahead

2184
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,719
hi scott can you hear me

2185
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,320
uh not very well i'm just going to turn

2186
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,800
up my volume a little bit

2187
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,639
okay not sure which mic i'm using here i

2188
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,480
got a couple of them but uh

2189
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,080
my question is do you

2190
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,400
anticipate regions

2191
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,760
to be

2192
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,719
uh predefined or are they dynamic so so

2193
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,920
okay in a region is a a going to be

2194
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,239
predefined by a by a location

2195
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,040
the

2196
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,120
the notion that that we've been working

2197
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,960
with is because it's based on contact

2198
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,880
graph routing but it's extensible to

2199
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,159
other kinds of

2200
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,199
routing

2201
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,600
uh um um

2202
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,719
approaches

2203
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,760
but but in the contact graph routing

2204
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,880
um

2205
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,920
context a region would be

2206
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,719
uh

2207
01:22:58,719 --> 01:22:59,920
uh

2208
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,080
coterminous with an identical as a in it

2209
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,520
one for one with

2210
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,159
with a single contact plan

2211
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,639
so as you define a contact plan that

2212
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,560
defines the region

2213
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,960
regions are strictly topological they're

2214
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,000
not geographical at all

2215
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,480
okay so technically if a node let's say

2216
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,159
that i was flying the space shuttle to

2217
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,040
mars

2218
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,880
on my way out i might be part of one

2219
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,320
region when i get out there i might

2220
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,239
become my own region

2221
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,400
and then

2222
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,920
i ideally

2223
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,520
ideally you might

2224
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,960
not be

2225
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,639
moving into a different region until you

2226
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,480
got to your final destination right that

2227
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,239
is the region could extend all the way

2228
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,560
from here to jupiter um the region is

2229
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,120
not geographical it's topological it's

2230
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,719
it's the reason is

2231
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,560
is uh um is a set of nodes

2232
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,920
that

2233
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,520
that communicate among themselves

2234
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,920
according to the contact plan

2235
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,840
okay so at some point i could be in a

2236
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,840
region and then

2237
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,679
i guess leave that region and that

2238
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,280
region may not even exist if there's a

2239
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,199
single node on that region

2240
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,480
sure

2241
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,000
okay

2242
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,320
thank you

2243
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,040
okay so um

2244
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,520
so uh picking up on on this idea here

2245
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,239
uh this managed regentry

2246
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,280
what you end up with is a globally uh

2247
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,520
managed structure that you can use to

2248
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,239
compute a path through the tree if you

2249
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,120
know

2250
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,159
the

2251
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,639
region that your destination node is in

2252
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,199
and each node forwards the bundle

2253
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,239
to the passageway that will get it to

2254
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,840
the next region on the path of

2255
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,719
passageways

2256
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,920
a second option which is the one that

2257
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,840
there's been some research on

2258
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,960
uh

2259
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,360
that attempts to avoid

2260
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,050
the

2261
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,920
[Music]

2262
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,840
global management of the structure

2263
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,400
is to base it all on a discovery

2264
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,600
protocol

2265
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,560
the topology of the region tree is

2266
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,679
locally discovered and revised by by

2267
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,520
pairwise agreements between

2268
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,400
uh

2269
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,800
regional management authorities so uh

2270
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,000
the the complete topology of the tree

2271
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,239
it never needs to be recorded anywhere

2272
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:25,199
which is advantageous especially if you

2273
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,080
have like a a large number of regions

2274
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,920
yeah right

2275
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,880
okay it's slightly with my chair hat on

2276
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,560
um

2277
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,960
we're in danger of slipping into into

2278
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,520
rooting routing here

2279
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,639
so

2280
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,239
and i know we have to be quite careful

2281
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,199
to dance around the edge of it

2282
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,360
but

2283
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,400
i'm very happy for us to talk about

2284
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,960
how does a bundle processing agent

2285
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,360
work out which

2286
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,320
of many next hops it wishes to push a

2287
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,400
bundle out to i think that's entirely in

2288
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,800
scope and that depends on having names

2289
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,120
and addresses and some kind of concept

2290
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,760
of topology that's fine

2291
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,239
when we start to say

2292
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,480
actually the way we name an address

2293
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,840
implicitly gives rooting information

2294
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,080
i think that becomes an increasingly

2295
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,080
contentious subject

2296
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,400
and i'll give you my reasoning for the

2297
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,600
same

2298
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,719
that you

2299
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,960
scott introduced along with your

2300
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
collaborators the late binding concept

2301
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,320
into dtn and it's one of the

2302
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,639
fundamentals of it which is

2303
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:33,840
um

2304
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,480
you can make an accurate decision

2305
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,880
after the bundle has entered the network

2306
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,040
in order to get it somewhere

2307
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,360
if the name you assert to the

2308
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,159
destination has already

2309
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,320
enforced how that

2310
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,560
bundle will get there then i think

2311
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,400
you've just broken the point of late

2312
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,840
binding

2313
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,400
it's it's well and you're adding a

2314
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,320
you're adding a pre

2315
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,719
um

2316
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,840
you're pre-enforcing how it must get

2317
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,280
there because of the way you have

2318
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,159
structured your names and i think that

2319
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,560
to the way we consider the dtn problem

2320
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,320
space so

2321
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,480
i'm very wary of going in this direction

2322
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,760
and now i'm speaking personally about

2323
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,280
this i

2324
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,280
it's something about this that doesn't

2325
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,400
quite chime with me sorry well

2326
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,600
which is why my next um

2327
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,639
where i'm going to next i think uh

2328
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,440
addresses that at least i think it does

2329
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,280
um which is

2330
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,800
that this

2331
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,679
uh

2332
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,440
discovery mechanism where the the the um

2333
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,000
topology of the region tree is

2334
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,159
is

2335
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,120
adjusted locally by

2336
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,159
the

2337
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,440
management authorities for the regions

2338
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,719
you don't have a complete tree topology

2339
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,639
and so you don't route

2340
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:57,440
on

2341
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,360
the tree topology

2342
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,440
you don't compute paths

2343
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,320
through the tree topology and you don't

2344
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,639
violate the weight binding idea that is

2345
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:10,320
this is sleep binding taken

2346
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,920
taken very seriously all the way to the

2347
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,040
bottom

2348
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,679
i actually prefer this and this is the

2349
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,000
thing that's implemented in the there's

2350
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,880
a

2351
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,120
feature branch of ion that has got this

2352
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,080
built i i think it's a better way to go

2353
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,960
um

2354
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,840
but it is

2355
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,679
a it's a less familiar model as i'll get

2356
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,000
to in a second and

2357
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,600
and on that basis

2358
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,280
uh it may be that people are more

2359
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,560
comfortable with

2360
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,760
a sort of a hybrid approach where you

2361
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,960
um

2362
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,880
you you um

2363
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,840
have

2364
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,480
uh you can compute a route through a

2365
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,679
known

2366
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,040
uh topology of regions and then you do

2367
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,120
like bind you know like binding

2368
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,000
discovery within the region uh i'm not

2369
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,920
going to say i like that better i think

2370
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,960
it's

2371
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,280
in in fairness to people who have who

2372
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,440
have proposed this i wanted to identify

2373
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,800
it and that's really what i was doing

2374
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,360
just a moment ago

2375
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,080
um yeah

2376
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,760
i understand the difference between uh

2377
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,560
having dynamic discovery of of of the

2378
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,800
the path through the network the routing

2379
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,480
the path through your tree

2380
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,560
and and having it pre-placed and that's

2381
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,920
that's a

2382
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,760
valid point

2383
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,560
but i still to me i think you're

2384
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,920
describing the name of something as

2385
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,080
go here then here then here and you'll

2386
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,239
get it there and and i will

2387
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,239
i really am not

2388
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,880
i i need to get to the end of these

2389
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,920
just to see how i'm not doing that

2390
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,320
um so uh the the the uh

2391
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,159
uh the

2392
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,840
the advantage here

2393
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,800
of

2394
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,280
uh of going with this

2395
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,199
automatically evolving tree is that when

2396
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,199
you encode the destination

2397
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,280
if it's a globally managed region tree

2398
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,120
you need to enclose

2399
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,800
include in the

2400
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,239
destination

2401
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,719
uh the name of the region that the node

2402
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:16,560
resides in so that you can give this

2403
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,840
computation

2404
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,000
if it's an automatically evolving region

2405
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,560
tree then you don't the destination is

2406
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,040
only encoded as the name and your late

2407
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,840
binding all the way

2408
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,719
these would be in my mind two different

2409
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,360
endpoint id

2410
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,360
definition schemes

2411
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:35,890
um

2412
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,800
[Music]

2413
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,080
uh

2414
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,000
they would affect

2415
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,480
what you need to do when a node moves

2416
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,400
from one region to another

2417
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,560
and the globally managed tree

2418
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,679
um uh option you need to

2419
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,840
change the destination encoding

2420
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,000
for that node at every node that sources

2421
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,120
bundles destined for that node so it's i

2422
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,000
i think that's undesirable but it's it

2423
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,960
it

2424
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,920
again

2425
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,280
lines up with a

2426
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,280
a with a more

2427
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,120
familiar model

2428
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,960
if you have an automatically evolving

2429
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,280
region tree the destination coding

2430
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,280
doesn't change because all it is is the

2431
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,639
name of the node

2432
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,960
uh but in that case you have to like

2433
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,320
rediscover

2434
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,199
the the new uh passageway sequence

2435
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,080
by

2436
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,280
doing some

2437
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,040
other mechanism that i won't go into

2438
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,480
here but it's basically a sort of a

2439
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,880
probe through the network to you to

2440
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,719
discover the right

2441
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,800
sequence of passageways

2442
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,480
um

2443
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,400
in both cases

2444
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,480
uh you you would really would want to

2445
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,960
provide advanced notice of the

2446
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,880
date and time of the change so that

2447
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,480
everybody can get the information ahead

2448
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,719
of time and be delay tolerant not be

2449
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:51,920
affected by

2450
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,719
signal um propagation delays

2451
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,960
this would give you time either for

2452
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,040
just to schedule either the changes in

2453
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,360
destination and coding and all the nodes

2454
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,040
or else the issuance of new probe

2455
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,159
bundles

2456
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,440
um

2457
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,400
and

2458
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,960
summing up i think this globally managed

2459
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,199
region tree is a familiar model it

2460
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,760
imposes modest additional overhead

2461
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,199
there's some additional administrative

2462
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,440
complexity not my favorite but it's you

2463
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,880
know in fairness we should we should

2464
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,159
consider this

2465
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,080
um i prefer

2466
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,040
the automatically evolving regentry

2467
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,199
blade binding all the way

2468
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,639
binding all the way down

2469
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,639
uh no additional overhead in data

2470
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,800
traffic but but during path discovery of

2471
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,880
course there's there's you have to

2472
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,280
get the information

2473
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,520
discovered in all the appropriate places

2474
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,400
somehow

2475
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,800
and so there needs to be some

2476
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,199
uh discovery protocol

2477
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,040
activity to make that happen

2478
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,120
uh i think that can be

2479
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,239
uh

2480
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,800
depending on how the regions are managed

2481
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,280
i think that can be modest but that's a

2482
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,960
fair topic for discussion and that's the

2483
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,840
end of my slides

2484
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,960
thank you scott i'm i'm i'm gonna

2485
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,960
come back with a personal comment again

2486
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,239
i think the summary slides are really

2487
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,600
useful

2488
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,840
i think the second bullet

2489
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,000
describes

2490
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,679
my personal understanding of what we're

2491
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,600
trying to do in terms of forwarding and

2492
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,000
routing in complex networks so that this

2493
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,840
is kind of how we've built the internet

2494
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,840
okay let's not get caught up in in

2495
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,120
locator id separation etc but

2496
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,440
fundamentally the the paths across the

2497
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,040
network change over time we have

2498
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,960
protocols which update

2499
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,280
what those next top actions that should

2500
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,199
be taken by the by the routers within

2501
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,120
the network so that that allows you to

2502
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,159
have that

2503
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,639
evolving

2504
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,800
and you could view a topology as a as a

2505
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,040
tree but it's probably a more complex uh

2506
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,880
hopefully a cyclic graph

2507
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,920
um

2508
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,480
your first point

2509
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,639
could be a very interesting short-term

2510
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,159
compromise and it's more of an open

2511
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:55,840
question to the working group or whether

2512
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,360
that would be something an organization

2513
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,920
like ccsds would be interested in

2514
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,840
where there would be a

2515
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,520
new um

2516
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,880
uh node

2517
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,719
eid scheme

2518
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,199
which encapsulates within the name the

2519
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,320
exact pre-known path of how to get to

2520
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,840
somewhere so it would be rick.bristol.uk

2521
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,199
you know how to get to me now or or

2522
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,800
backwards and i'm not saying that like a

2523
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,199
dns name there's no looking up

2524
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,360
it's implicitly known how to get there

2525
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,840
and it is encoded in the name

2526
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,960
now

2527
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,400
my personal opinion said before is i

2528
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,840
think that goes against what we're

2529
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,159
trying to do with dtn but i can see that

2530
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,320
appealing particularly to

2531
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,280
um

2532
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,400
the space community for a a specific

2533
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,119
project uh for a specific mission or

2534
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,119
whatever they know everything in great

2535
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,520
detail or i hope they do so it might be

2536
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,600
entirely viable for them to do that

2537
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,880
however from an ietf perspective

2538
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,480
i don't think that's a use case that's

2539
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,080
valid to the working group and i wonder

2540
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,040
whether

2541
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,119
any

2542
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,880
working group members are interested

2543
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,639
even in working in that or whether

2544
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,239
actually we ought to be tackling that

2545
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,400
harder problem which ties into the late

2546
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,880
binding concepts which are so strong and

2547
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,080
managing

2548
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,159
big complex systems that are fairly

2549
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,520
future proof

2550
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,400
uh i uh i'm two two things before we uh

2551
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,040
take the questions uh i i agree with you

2552
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,920
i think the the the second is

2553
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,880
uh the second option is superior and and

2554
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,560
is more uh more dtn like um

2555
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,840
the

2556
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
the difference in

2557
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,000
the way you encode the destination

2558
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,239
whether you include include the name of

2559
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:41,280
the region

2560
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,880
uh in the

2561
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,199
the destination encoding in the bundle

2562
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,159
is why i think this question belongs in

2563
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,800
the discussion of naming and addressing

2564
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,679
uh

2565
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,600
yeah you have to drag in some routing

2566
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,639
ideas to to make the point but it is a

2567
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,119
naming and addressing question do we

2568
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:00,880
do we stick with

2569
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,480
the idea of uh naming the node and

2570
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,960
and addressing a bundle to a node by

2571
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,000
name or do we

2572
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,080
stretch things a little bit and and

2573
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,840
include

2574
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,320
a gross

2575
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,440
location of the node uh the destination

2576
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,239
node in the destination encoding

2577
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,920
the name of the region that the the node

2578
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:24,800
is in

2579
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,040
uh i uh i'm

2580
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,880
i prefer certainly the

2581
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,760
the

2582
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,960
automatic evolving region tree and and

2583
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,760
just using the destination node's name

2584
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,159
as the destination in the bundle but

2585
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,239
it's a reasonable thing to talk about

2586
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,400
and i think it's ed's

2587
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,159
heads up

2588
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,800
so so i scott just just to agree i i

2589
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,280
think that this does resolve into uh

2590
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,440
naming and addressing

2591
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,159
the the question that that i have and

2592
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,880
maybe after eric comes after me we can

2593
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,280
get into this is the discussion is

2594
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,560
uh how does this imply

2595
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,360
format structure restrictions on the

2596
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,400
names

2597
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,679
and uh

2598
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:12,080
my my comment is

2599
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,840
instead of saying that

2600
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,880
if we were to presuppose uh that

2601
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,920
destinations as you have um talked about

2602
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:20,800
them

2603
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,760
have sort of a region and and some

2604
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,320
additional information uh related to

2605
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,600
that region

2606
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,320
do we consider that entire destination

2607
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,800
to be either late binding or not late

2608
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
binding or within the structure of a

2609
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,360
destination uh do you say if you have a

2610
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,840
region id the region id is not a late

2611
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,520
binding concept

2612
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,239
and and the internal in internal to the

2613
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:45,520
region piece

2614
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,840
um that may be late bound and and

2615
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,480
because we've structured the destination

2616
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,679
um itself do we treat different pieces

2617
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,760
of that destination uh differently from

2618
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,080
a binding perspective is is that what we

2619
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,080
would need to do to make something like

2620
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,520
this work

2621
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,239
for me the the key uh

2622
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,719
question is whether or not there's any

2623
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,159
topological

2624
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,080
information of any kind

2625
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,560
in the encoding of the destination

2626
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,480
if there's topological information in

2627
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,360
there for example the name of the region

2628
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,360
that the node resides in

2629
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,159
then

2630
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,880
then you've you've got the the

2631
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,639
you end up with the globally managed

2632
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,239
region tree kind of thing i mean you

2633
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,920
might be able to

2634
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,760
do it automatically but

2635
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,840
there's there's no advantage i think you

2636
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
need to do things like

2637
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,560
when the node changes regions you need

2638
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,679
to tell everybody in the network um that

2639
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:42,000
the node is in a different place and and

2640
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,320
the encoding of destinations needs to

2641
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,280
change

2642
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,280
uh if you omit

2643
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,800
uh all

2644
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,639
topological information

2645
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,119
from the destination

2646
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,280
which is to say the name of the node the

2647
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,679
identifying unique identifying name of

2648
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,760
the node and nothing else

2649
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,719
then you avoid all that there is

2650
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,400
um

2651
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,520
there is

2652
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,560
a

2653
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,119
cost to that which is that then you need

2654
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:09,920
a

2655
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,480
an automatic mechanism for

2656
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,159
uh for for uh discovering the paths

2657
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,920
through the region

2658
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,080
uh network and i will say tree because i

2659
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:20,960
am

2660
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,560
convinced that the tree is much better

2661
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,840
way to do it um

2662
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,080
uh but but if you can

2663
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,960
uh if you can uh accomplish that

2664
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,320
automatic

2665
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,600
um management uh pairwise management of

2666
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,159
the connections in the tree then

2667
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,520
um

2668
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,840
i think that that um

2669
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,800
that approaches is superior it's it's

2670
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,239
it's there's less thrashing in the

2671
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,360
network

2672
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,199
uh as soon as you

2673
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,119
admit of any

2674
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,360
topological information at all

2675
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,320
in the coding of the destination

2676
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,000
uh you are

2677
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,199
uh

2678
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,239
you are no longer doing uh complete late

2679
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:04,239
binding you have you have bound right

2680
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:07,520
you you you early bound

2681
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,920
to to a limited extent you have early

2682
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,960
bound

2683
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,080
the

2684
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,280
um

2685
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,119
the destination of

2686
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,239
of the node you're sending to

2687
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:21,959
does that answer your question

2688
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,920
doesn't i do want to jump

2689
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,840
as quickly as we can into in the time

2690
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,000
remaining to to at least lay out some of

2691
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,239
the topics my point is exactly what

2692
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,679
you're saying is that if we go this

2693
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,440
route there is a

2694
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,639
that would be the um the requirement uh

2695
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,719
to to have that early binding concept at

2696
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,880
least for something like regions and the

2697
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,840
topology but let's let's go over to eric

2698
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,080
sure

2699
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,000
uh eric klein in the interest of time

2700
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
i'll try to keep myself to clarifying

2701
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,480
questions

2702
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,920
uh does a node know all of its available

2703
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,239
names as it moves from region to region

2704
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,400
or does it never change names i'm having

2705
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,320
a hard time with this abstract stuff but

2706
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,000
there's i'm trying to build

2707
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,360
uh in this yeah in this concept i would

2708
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,080
say that a node only has one name and it

2709
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,199
always has

2710
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,840
one name and that's all uh well let me

2711
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,960
say that again

2712
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,639
uh it might have

2713
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,360
uh it might have ids it might have node

2714
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,639
ids

2715
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,760
uh expressed in in multiple endpoint id

2716
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,440
schemes for

2717
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,920
other reasons for for uh implementation

2718
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,880
reasons but um but it's

2719
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,560
it's its name within any single eid

2720
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,960
scheme should never change if it does

2721
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,239
it's a different if it's a different

2722
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:39,119
it's a different note at that point

2723
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,119
so there might be a

2724
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,360
dtn colon name and a

2725
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,799
dtn-region colon name

2726
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,719
do you mean region literally or do you

2727
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,400
mean dtn

2728
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,040
xyz region

2729
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,440
wqr region

2730
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,600
uh perhaps either i'm trying to build

2731
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,440
some sort of a

2732
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,679
a sample thing to to like grab my head

2733
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,000
around because all of this is pretty

2734
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
abstract yeah that's

2735
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,360
that that would be

2736
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,040
an interesting way to do it you could

2737
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,320
say

2738
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,119
i'm sending this node to

2739
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:21,450
uh node um

2740
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:22,719
[Music]

2741
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:23,920
abc

2742
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,960
uh and i'm sending it to its identity

2743
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,639
within region

2744
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,400
so and so whenever it's in reading so

2745
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,040
and so it's it's available it it it's uh

2746
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,360
it's got it's it's possible for it to be

2747
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,920
delivered there and and if it's not in

2748
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,360
reason so and so

2749
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,239
then um then when i send it there it's

2750
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,600
not going to get there

2751
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,199
um i

2752
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,280
uh i'm

2753
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,719
i would need to think about whether

2754
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:49,600
there's

2755
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,000
an advantage in doing that my instinct

2756
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,679
is that i don't see it as being

2757
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,679
advantageous but um

2758
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,679
that i should think about it

2759
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:58,880
i'm just trying to understand some more

2760
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,159
thank you i'll

2761
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,638
save the rest

2762
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,600
go ahead jordan

2763
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,480
hi

2764
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,920
um

2765
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,360
i was just going to make the comment

2766
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,000
that the automatically evolving region

2767
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,840
tree cost

2768
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,320
is when you send out these probes it's

2769
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,480
going to take a while to determine what

2770
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,080
the optimum

2771
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,239
that the tree topology looks like in the

2772
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,000
subtrees and so forth

2773
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,480
and in interplanetary networking

2774
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,760
situations

2775
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,560
that may be totally uh

2776
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,840
intractable

2777
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,000
if it takes 40 minutes one way light

2778
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,880
time to get to mars and 40 minutes back

2779
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,719
to find out

2780
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:47,600
which

2781
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,000
relay node you need to

2782
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,080
talk to to get to a local mars region

2783
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,239
by the time you formulate your plan to

2784
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,400
go ahead and use that probe to send to

2785
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:01,440
that particular

2786
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
passageway

2787
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,678
that particular

2788
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,440
the orbiter might be on the back side of

2789
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,960
mars and you've completely missed your

2790
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,280
opportunity so we need to be careful

2791
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,440
about thinking through the

2792
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,719
delay part of delay tolerant networking

2793
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,480
and then

2794
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,239
yeah i i i completely agree the and uh

2795
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,679
you know

2796
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:28,400
i i think the the way that this thing

2797
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,480
uh would have to work is that things

2798
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,360
like

2799
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,719
which side of a planet you're on and so

2800
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,119
on would would not be

2801
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,480
region

2802
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,639
scale considerations those would be

2803
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,520
considerations for uh late binding

2804
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,679
within the region that that a region

2805
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,239
would be something that that a node

2806
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:50,080
would not uh casually or frequently

2807
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,159
uh

2808
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:53,040
change

2809
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,239
that is you don't

2810
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,239
you don't casually or frequently

2811
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:58,320
uh move from you know the united states

2812
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,239
to portugal if you if you did it it

2813
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,199
would be a big deal and there's a

2814
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,520
there's definitely an overhead in in

2815
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,960
making that happen

2816
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,000
uh and that overhead is incurred

2817
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,280
uh

2818
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,960
uh rarely enough

2819
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,480
that you can uh tolerate some um

2820
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,400
sub-optimal network performance while

2821
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,679
it's going on that's the idea

2822
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:23,520
so

2823
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,440
jordan i would consider that topic to

2824
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,520
absolutely be rooting and therefore

2825
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,000
slightly out of scope for this but yeah

2826
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,360
everything you've highlighted are

2827
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,600
absolutely good considerations for how

2828
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,080
do we manage and maintain the

2829
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,520
uh forwarding information in the

2830
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,600
individual bundle processing nodes in an

2831
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,520
optimal and uh usable way

2832
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,080
scott my

2833
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,840
you and i have talked about this region

2834
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
uh concept before several times and i

2835
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,239
think what yeah i have disagreed

2836
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,320
is

2837
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,239
i love the approach

2838
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:58,719
but i would like

2839
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:01,440
actually regions not to be

2840
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,920
topologically significant

2841
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,320
by that i mean talk about how you get a

2842
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:09,119
bundle to a direct to a to an

2843
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,800
destination

2844
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,320
but actually to be a way of subdividing

2845
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,560
the naming space

2846
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,600
so that you don't have to have uh the

2847
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:20,880
phone book

2848
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,719
of everyone

2849
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,639
in order to map a name to who the next

2850
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:30,400
hop a name to route to the destination

2851
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,560
so i'll give you a worked example let's

2852
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,040
say you've got a region called

2853
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,080
issa and a region called nasa

2854
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,719
then both issa and nasa can have a mars

2855
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,360
rover called mars rover too

2856
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,960
oh okay sure if i if if i

2857
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,880
am part of the nasa team who wishes to

2858
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,520
send some sort of information to the esa

2859
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,600
mars rover too i

2860
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,679
set the destination of the bundle to

2861
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:58,480
mars rover two dot esa for example and i

2862
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,480
don't really care about the encoding

2863
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,280
so within the nasa space

2864
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,080
within the nasa network the individual

2865
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,480
nodes that are moving that bundle around

2866
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,840
may not know

2867
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,440
where on earth

2868
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,040
mars rover 2.

2869
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,520
is or where on mars mars rover 2. there

2870
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,320
we go

2871
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,719
thank you much have a good week

2872
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,480
but they

2873
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,199
but they do know how to get something to

2874
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:26,159
someone who is in the eastern naming

2875
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,199
region

2876
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,880
so they can get to your passageway what

2877
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,000
i call a gateway traditionally to say oh

2878
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,239
if i know if i get it to this node that

2879
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,000
node will be able to resolve that esa

2880
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,320
name to something it might be the isa

2881
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,159
nasa gateway and there might be a

2882
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,719
peering agreement between issa and nasa

2883
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,199
to say here are some gateways that have

2884
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,679
a name in both

2885
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,239
so you could have issa nasa gateway dot

2886
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,760
issa at isa nasa gateway dot nasa

2887
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,280
both names assigned to a single bpa

2888
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,440
because they understand both areas and

2889
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,440
these could be pretty fat nodes you know

2890
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,719
place them in a sensible place in your

2891
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:05,280
network so i'm not talking i love your

2892
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,199
concept of regions

2893
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,600
but i would like to divide the naming

2894
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,800
space

2895
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:15,280
and not the routing space into regions

2896
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,600
because i think it's just requiring a

2897
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,000
top-down name registrar for all names of

2898
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,840
everything everywhere

2899
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,280
and i think it gives us a lot more

2900
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,360
flexibility in terms of peering

2901
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,400
agreements and about how we build these

2902
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,800
larger interconnections between these

2903
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,880
various uh naming

2904
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,480
autonomous autonomously named regions

2905
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,560
uh i i think uh

2906
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,239
um

2907
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,199
hierarchical uh naming

2908
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,239
structure

2909
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,040
is a perfectly reasonable and and in

2910
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,239
fact

2911
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,159
well my preference is

2912
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,600
that not to use

2913
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,119
um

2914
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:55,440
ascii names at all but rather to use

2915
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,440
node numbers and

2916
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,900
for those node numbers to be assigned in

2917
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,639
[Applause]

2918
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:03,679
uniquely

2919
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,320
identifying but to be assigned within

2920
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,719
ranges that

2921
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,199
that are associated with

2922
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,760
organizational entities so that the the

2923
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,599
number so that the organizational entity

2924
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:16,480
could be

2925
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:17,360
um

2926
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,040
inferred directly from

2927
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,760
the destination node number and then if

2928
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,480
you

2929
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,520
if you have

2930
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,679
uh some uh

2931
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:28,000
a routing system that

2932
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,040
can use that that hint to

2933
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,520
improve your routing then by gosh go

2934
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,000
ahead and do it um

2935
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
i think for

2936
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,320
um

2937
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,599
i i think the

2938
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:44,880
um

2939
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,960
the notion of of reason as it's used for

2940
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,400
uh uh

2941
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,599
routing

2942
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:52,480
is

2943
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,679
uh

2944
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,320
separately important because you

2945
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:59,040
wouldn't necessarily have to

2946
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,480
base your writing decisions on

2947
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,920
knowledge of peering agreements between

2948
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,719
organizational entities that own the

2949
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,159
the nodes i i see nothing wrong with

2950
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,040
with um with enabling

2951
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,000
that kind of mechanism um but i i think

2952
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,560
it's more general if we don't require it

2953
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,560
and that's that's why i think the the

2954
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,639
region structure is a topological um

2955
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,880
structure

2956
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,400
rather than a

2957
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,800
a naming mechanism i think that the

2958
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,800
naming mechanism ought to be in the

2959
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,239
names themselves

2960
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:38,960
um but i don't want to like dominate the

2961
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,440
conversation with that i i think

2962
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,760
stewart has maybe other ideas but you've

2963
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,320
got a response to this

2964
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,920
my response is let's take this offline i

2965
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,040
think this is a really interesting

2966
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:53,840
conversation to have i i agree yeah

2967
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,960
go ahead stu card here so uh a comment

2968
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,119
request and a question first to comment

2969
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,280
um thanks scott for a very

2970
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,199
logical um

2971
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:07,360
shaping of the discussion your first few

2972
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,280
slides i think bring a lot of clarity to

2973
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,080
this

2974
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,119
um

2975
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:13,840
then the request i i hope that as we go

2976
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,960
forward

2977
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,239
we can not paint ourselves into a corner

2978
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,199
that precludes essentially an arp

2979
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:22,480
function

2980
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,560
that maps us into different uh

2981
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,320
identifier spaces

2982
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,159
different um

2983
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,000
logical location

2984
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,960
spaces and different physical location

2985
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,599
spaces two with which i'm particularly

2986
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:37,119
concerned are

2987
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:39,360
host identity protocol host identity

2988
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,440
tags especially the new hierarchical

2989
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,119
host identity tags

2990
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:45,199
and high frequency automatic link

2991
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,679
establishment addresses ale addresses

2992
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,520
and then finally the question

2993
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,320
um do your regions partition a space

2994
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:58,719
um or can they overlap

2995
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,199
uh good question um

2996
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,520
and i would i would say

2997
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,880
the

2998
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,480
uh

2999
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,199
the

3000
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,199
region's

3001
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,400
uh

3002
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,599
partition

3003
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:13,040
of the

3004
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,119
uh the topology

3005
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:17,839
um

3006
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:23,360
at the same time a node

3007
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,280
can be

3008
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,599
can be a member of multiple regions

3009
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,159
every passageway is has to be it has to

3010
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:32,480
be a member of multiple regions

3011
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,400
uh

3012
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:34,700
the

3013
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:35,920
[Music]

3014
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:36,960
uh

3015
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,119
if

3016
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,800
you could take that

3017
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,599
that

3018
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:43,040
concept of

3019
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,639
passageway that is

3020
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,639
um membership in multiple regions which

3021
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:47,520
is what

3022
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,119
would would enable

3023
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:51,119
uh overlapping if you wanted that you

3024
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:53,119
could take that to an extreme

3025
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:54,080
um

3026
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:59,040
and and say uh any node can be in any

3027
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,360
of regions

3028
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,080
and therefore you you can you know route

3029
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:04,719
in

3030
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:07,119
some um

3031
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:09,440
uh interesting and uh

3032
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,760
optimized ways um i think

3033
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,599
that's um

3034
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:18,639
a direction to be avoided because

3035
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:19,520
uh

3036
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,599
and here again this is going to

3037
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,560
um my firm held conviction that that the

3038
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,159
reason is ought to be organized in a

3039
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:27,599
tree it's

3040
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:28,400
uh

3041
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,799
it is

3042
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,400
from an implementation point of view i

3043
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,280
think very difficult to avoid

3044
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,320
um

3045
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,679
introducing

3046
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,800
routing loops if you have the

3047
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,000
regions

3048
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,920
organized in any structure other than a

3049
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,880
tree

3050
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,760
in order to avoid writing loops i think

3051
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,360
you need

3052
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:52,719
way more information about

3053
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,679
the no the reason topology and that gets

3054
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:58,239
you back to the all the same problems of

3055
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:01,280
globally managing the region tree

3056
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,320
um that i think it's desirable to avoid

3057
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,920
if it's automatic

3058
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,719
then

3059
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,400
uh

3060
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,440
then the the tree automatically forms

3061
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:14,080
itself if you uh limit the rules by

3062
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,239
which things connect up

3063
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,719
uh if it's if it's not a tree

3064
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,960
then um i

3065
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,360
i i foresee

3066
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,400
um

3067
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:27,040
potentially very major

3068
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:30,480
uh headaches in getting the

3069
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,880
the topology to work

3070
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,599
in a reliable way

3071
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,520
so uh i closed the cube thank you very

3072
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,159
much scott for that answer uh zahed go

3073
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:43,760
for it we have about

3074
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,639
six minutes left so uh yeah

3075
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:47,920
i

3076
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:48,880
so

3077
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,840
yeah you had your transport lady and i'm

3078
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,080
actually putting my head on

3079
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,960
so

3080
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,360
so yeah i mean i mean we started the

3081
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,360
discussion about uh riku saying like we

3082
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,920
don't have a document uh but we don't

3083
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,040
want to

3084
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,960
commit to that we're not in at that

3085
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,199
point the commit to write documents

3086
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:08,800
but

3087
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,719
thanks to scott and to the working group

3088
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:13,280
i mean this was a really good discussion

3089
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,480
and i think

3090
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,880
there is a certain maturity of the ideas

3091
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,760
and certain pros and cons that i think

3092
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,320
when now it's time to actually write it

3093
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,239
down because i think i see there are

3094
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:25,920
questions like how the name could be or

3095
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,000
the schemes could give how the reasons

3096
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,760
could be i think it's very good to have

3097
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,360
the discussion when things are

3098
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,119
documented so this is not only the

3099
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,639
presentation i look

3100
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:36,800
look or recognize i look i'll have a

3101
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,199
document and actually i can read and see

3102
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:42,000
like what could make more sense right so

3103
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,239
i strongly recommend the working to come

3104
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:47,520
so somebody maybe maybe scott yes

3105
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,159
to actually write it down uh and then we

3106
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:52,400
can have further discussion on that one

3107
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:55,360
um so that's my idiot on and and then my

3108
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,520
understanding uh of the reason and

3109
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,199
concept of like overlapping question

3110
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:01,360
that still asks like it can have

3111
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:03,040
overlapping reason but then the problem

3112
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,400
is you cannot have a name collision and

3113
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,679
you have to avoid that and that's the

3114
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,800
complexity to bring in if you overlap so

3115
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,360
so yeah so my advice to this working

3116
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,679
group please write things down so that

3117
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,360
we have a more constructive discussion

3118
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,040
going forward and

3119
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,960
and this is a very good discussion we

3120
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,719
have three ideas here so you're well

3121
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:25,119
covered

3122
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:26,840
i

3123
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,960
i uh

3124
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,280
it has taken us i think this long

3125
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,360
to get to the point of

3126
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,400
of um

3127
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,199
being able to articulate these ideas at

3128
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:42,639
this level at this puny level so

3129
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,159
uh i i agree i think if if if we're

3130
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,800
interested in in in pursuing

3131
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:52,719
uh this direction then uh then i

3132
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:54,480
certainly i think it's a good time to

3133
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,440
start on a on a draft and i would be uh

3134
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,280
happy to participate in writing that

3135
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,599
draft

3136
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,560
i think that's a great starting point i

3137
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,719
take zahed's point about let's have some

3138
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,599
text which gives us

3139
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:11,360
the kernel around which the grain of

3140
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,119
sand around which we can build a pearl

3141
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:14,719
it might take us a while to get there

3142
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,639
but it means we have something to point

3143
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:18,320
to because i was looking back through

3144
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,080
the history we had an interim on naming

3145
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,440
and addressing in

3146
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,920
may 2021 where a lot of these things

3147
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,159
were introduced but

3148
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,400
we have many slide decks talking around

3149
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,599
this but i think

3150
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:31,119
zahed makes a very good point about

3151
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:33,040
let's just try and get some text there

3152
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,960
and then we can have vigorous and

3153
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,639
practical discussion on the mailing list

3154
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:41,119
to really hone it down to something um

3155
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,520
brilliant thank you scott um and that

3156
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,880
doesn't necessarily mean scott you have

3157
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,639
to do it it means if somebody is feeling

3158
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:48,719
bold go for it collate what's out there

3159
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:51,199
or put your own ideas and put it in text

3160
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,360
and that's i there is no problem with

3161
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,119
having three documents that take

3162
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:57,280
different approaches that that's great

3163
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,520
we can we can we can proceed in that way

3164
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,560
um we have three minutes left uh that we

3165
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,920
always try and give five minutes at the

3166
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,440
end of the session so that people could

3167
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,638
bring up any other business

3168
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:13,199
hint to ed there was the uh compressed

3169
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,679
bundle header registry ayanna i'm not

3170
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,840
sure if you wanted to mention that

3171
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,360
or if yeah

3172
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,880
any other general topics this is your

3173
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,719
chance to jump to the queue

3174
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:24,480
all right so so while we're waiting uh

3175
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,480
i'll unlock the queue uh so while we're

3176
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,679
waiting for people to jump into the

3177
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:28,480
queue

3178
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,639
uh two things uh real quick one

3179
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:33,280
observation that uh we we seem to have

3180
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,840
no problem filling in uh two hours uh

3181
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,679
and more sessions hopefully will be

3182
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,840
available to us at 1 15.

3183
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,480
um the second is a

3184
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,159
question should we try and have an

3185
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,840
interim meeting before 1 15.

3186
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,000
uh to try and pick up on some of the the

3187
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,480
naming and addressing uh workshop that

3188
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,719
we weren't able to get to today

3189
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:58,400
uh to i think eric's point uh earlier

3190
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,880
uh there is a real question as to how

3191
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:05,280
are nodes uh how are eids used not just

3192
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,520
used from a routing perspective how are

3193
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,440
they used from a security perspective

3194
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,960
how are they used from a custody

3195
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,760
perspective how are they used when we

3196
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,639
define contact plans or things of that

3197
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:17,920
nature

3198
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,199
very concerned about the idea that a

3199
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:24,560
bundle may be identified using one dtn

3200
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,320
scheme

3201
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,400
and then at a waypoint node or at a

3202
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,800
destination security policy or other

3203
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,000
policy may be using a different eid

3204
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,280
scheme

3205
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,800
and what happens

3206
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,000
in those cases i think that this is

3207
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,119
going to push us to creating some kind

3208
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,880
of structure to to our eid uh scheme

3209
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,040
names but perhaps not and i think we

3210
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,840
need to understand uh how do we how do

3211
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,440
we exist with multiple names uh for for

3212
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,480
the same

3213
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:59,599
nodes multiple names for the same eids

3214
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:02,719
and what is that practical cascade into

3215
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:05,360
security routing

3216
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:08,080
custody reliability quality of service

3217
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,400
and other things and i think until we

3218
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,639
really get a handle on that we should

3219
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,520
not be going too deep into the users of

3220
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,320
dtn names um until we get the naming

3221
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,560
itself done so i i would recommend that

3222
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,480
we have an interim meeting between now

3223
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,559
and 115.

3224
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,440
thanks ed uh i 100 agree with you and as

3225
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,199
co-chairs let's just

3226
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,440
get that arranged and and if

3227
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,199
public proper size it on the list and if

3228
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:36,480
nobody turns up that's fine we could

3229
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,280
just shut the queue so i i think fully

3230
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,560
support that go ahead scott keep it

3231
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:41,679
short because we're over running and

3232
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:42,960
they're going to turn our mic off very

3233
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,239
soon

3234
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:47,199
uh right uh very briefly i think

3235
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:49,040
uh this would of course be very

3236
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,960
controversial i think we should

3237
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,840
settle on one eid scheme it should be no

3238
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,800
numbers and i think that the resolution

3239
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,520
of

3240
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,080
names to numbers should be a a

3241
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,000
a local

3242
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,719
implementation matter supported by

3243
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,639
the capabilities uh provided by the the

3244
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:12,800
networks within within which the the

3245
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,639
nodes are located and i will i see

3246
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,639
i see glee

3247
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:20,880
i will i will i don't desist

3248
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,560
it's it's glee because i think you

3249
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,000
should put that on the mailing list

3250
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
because it's been quiet i think an

3251
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,080
enormous amount of feedback will come

3252
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,679
off the back of it we will all be

3253
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,920
positive but i think it will be vigorous

3254
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,520
discussion around that subject and i

3255
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,760
look forward to seeing the mailing list

3256
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,920
light up with debate on that subject

3257
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,000
meanwhile thank you very much everyone

3258
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,599

3262
