1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,759
nobody speaking right

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
yes

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,800
um

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
thank you very much everybody for

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,760
um coming to the snack bath

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
and um

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
so this is uh working group forming buff

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
and we'll kind of share

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
our goals before going forward

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
and there's quite a bit of remote

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,559
participants so when you talk please

12
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,800
state your name

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
or like you know go use your app to uh

14
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
sign on to the queue

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
and uh

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
next slide

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
go to the notepad yeah so this meeting

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
is bound by the noteworld so we're not

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
expected to read all the text that's in

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
here but generally whatever you say here

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
is like a contribution so please be

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
mindful of that and there's like a bunch

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,479
of rfc's you can read as to what that

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,798
means

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
and this is like a meet echo uh

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
steps you've probably already seen this

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
either as a remote participant or a

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,640
on-site participant so please

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
follow the thing because we need to

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
manage a cube between both

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
physical and remote participants thank

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
you

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
next slide

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
so uh what we're trying to do is uh

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
since it's like a bath we are trying to

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
focus a lot on the problem statement

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
itself and see if we need to work on

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,399
this

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
and we're going to spend the bulk of the

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
time of the meeting

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
uh discussing the problems and not

42
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
really the solutions so we start off

43
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
with like five minutes like for all this

44
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
like housekeeping work that the chairs

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
need to do and then we kind of hand it

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
off to ted to kind of start talking

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
about what are the problems to solve and

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
then also jonathan

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
and michael also have other things to

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
talk about in the problem space

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
and after that and try to keep your

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,959
questions to a minimum like use just

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
clarifying questions in this first part

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,879
but we'll have time at the end of the

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,480
presentations for any kind of question

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
so if you have questions about anything

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
that people talked about please feel

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
free to invoke them and say like hey i

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
had a question on whatever which is not

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,680
a clarifying question why this is

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
necessary and so on so you can ask those

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
questions later and then we have a few

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
um

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
questions before we start discussing

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,519
what's on the charter and we're going to

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
go through the charter it's like dense

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,760
text so we'll probably just go through a

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,400
pdf like that came out of google docs

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
and we go line by line or paragraph by

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
paragraph and see what people think

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
about it and at the end we want to pull

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
the the room and people who are

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
participating as to what they think

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,519
about

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,120
this charter and this problem statement

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
and whether we should work on it of

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
course everything to be confirmed on a

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
mailing list afterwards but the idea is

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
to figure out at the end of the day

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
whether this work is going to go forward

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,080
and in what form so that's kind of what

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
we are shooting for thank you

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,319
so um this is like verbatim from like

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
rfc 5434 so what are we trying to do

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
here right so

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
we want to figure out if this i don't

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
know if it's like too difficult to read

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
but it's pretty much summarizing what i

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
was saying before like whether there's a

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
problem with solving and is ietf the

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,799
right place to solve it that's like a

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
high level goal of what we're trying to

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
do here

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
so

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,760
and

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
that's what we're shooting towards so if

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
you see us cutting you off or like

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
cutting the mic line at some point

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
this is really the goal because we want

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
to get to a solution at the end of the

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
day today thank you

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
and that's it i think we can swap over

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,799
to

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,040
ted's presentation so if you have any

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
questions about the agenda now would be

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,080
a good time to ask

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,920
um

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
danielle you are asking for presentation

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
permissions

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,360
okay

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
okay so

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,759
ted please thanks

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
okay yeah i might want to do that

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
because we've got all these charts now

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
so we want to flip back and forth

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
all right so uh

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,919
i'm gonna just uh

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
let's see can you guys hear me back

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
there

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
okay great uh we got some instruction

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
from karsten about uh how to use the mic

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
um so i'm gonna talk a bit about uh the

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,280
the stub networks problem that uh that

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
we saw and that we'd like to to discuss

125
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
in the itf

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
um

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,199
oh

128
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
the mic is on it may just not be picking

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
up my voice very well

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
let's let's see so

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
yeah all right

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
masks all right so uh wow this is i

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
can't really see my slides

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
well if

135
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
let's let's just point this at me i can

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
read i can read that

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
okay so um

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
yeah so the problem statement uh

139
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,600
basically uh we already have this

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,199
ability that we've developed in the ietf

141
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
over the last however many years

142
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
that if you have like a some kind of

143
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
host and you want to connect it to your

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
network you can just connect it to the

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
network

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
oh no

147
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
oh no it's the slides the slides are not

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,360
showing up in the meat echo

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
that may be why we're seeing the scan me

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
on this screen

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,800
okay so this is a good barometer

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
okay yay

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
okay

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
so uh

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
i'm gonna try and stand right in front

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
of the mic and hopefully we'll be able

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,639
to see the slides

158
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
it hates us

159
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,720
so i think you may need to acknowledge

160
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
somebody may need to acknowledge it

161
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
i am

162
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,318
i think the expert is coming

163
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,639
i think

164
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
well we actually want to share it from

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
this laptop so that i can control it

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,479
we don't seem to have a flight here

167
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
hang on i'll just bring my laptop and we

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
can check for my laptop

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,400
there we go

170
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,599
okay that looks good

171
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
all right

172
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
so um so the problem we're trying to

173
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
talk about here is uh we we are we

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
already know how to connect hosts

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
to networks pretty much automatically

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
like you know you might have to punch in

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
some authentication information or

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
something like that but but

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
it's an understood problem we know how

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
to do it you can connect your your phone

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
or your laptop or whatever to any

182
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
network that you need to and

183
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
the infrastructure to do that is there

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
um but the problem we have uh is that we

185
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
don't have that same ability in the case

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
of a stub network um and so

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,039
this became an issue uh for

188
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,279
uh it was it was an issue that was high

189
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,479
on our radar

190
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,958
um at apple because we wanted to be able

191
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,080
to connect uh iot networks to

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
infrastructure

193
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
and uh infrastructure meaning like your

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,279
home wi-fi and we need to do that

195
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,320
automatically we didn't want to have um

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
uh

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
we didn't want we didn't want the end

198
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,519
user to have to be an expert to make it

199
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
work so

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
um and just to talk about like the

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
problem that we're trying to solve here

202
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
uh we want

203
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
hosts that are on these stub networks

204
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
stub network

205
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
just to just to talk about that a little

206
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
bit is a is a network that's attached to

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
another network dependent on that

208
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
network and

209
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
doesn't provide routing so

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
so we wanted to be able to attach that

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
kind of network to an infrastructure

212
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
network we wanted

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
mutual reachability between hosts on the

214
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
infrastructure and hosts on the stub

215
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
network

216
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
and mutual discoverability so like if

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
you've got a light bulb on the stub

218
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,640
network you want to be able to control

219
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
that light bulb

220
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
from a device that's on the

221
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
infrastructure network

222
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,839
um

223
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,200
so uh

224
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
see is there anything else to say about

225
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,399
this

226
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
yeah so that's the basic idea connect a

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
stub network get the same experience

228
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
that a host

229
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,839
the host on the infrastructure should

230
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,360
have the exact same experience as a host

231
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
on the stub network in terms of using

232
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,079
the local network resources

233
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
uh and you know we've seen uh we've

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
we've seen uh solutions to this

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,959
uh

236
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,079
that sort of happen accidentally

237
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,480
to show you the topology here basically

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
home network you plug another ce router

239
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
into your home network suddenly you have

240
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
two networks but it doesn't work that

241
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
well

242
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
this doesn't really solve our problem uh

243
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
we in theory devices on the interlink

244
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
can reach the outer devices on the outer

245
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
link but there's no reachability in the

246
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
other direction

247
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
and there's no service discovery between

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
links

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
and you know devices on both links can

250
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
reach the internet and so you actually

251
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
see these networks

252
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
fairly frequently in people's homes

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
accidentally they didn't intend to set

254
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
up a network like this but they've set

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
one up

256
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
and then they have all these problems

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
they have service discovery problems and

258
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,519
just all kinds of problems

259
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
so but and this basically only works if

260
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,359
you're trying to reach out to the cloud

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
so

262
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
just to talk about goals uh the primary

263
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
goal

264
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
that

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
that i had for this work and that i i

266
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
hope is of interest to the itf

267
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
is enabling mutual reachability between

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
stub hosts and infrastructure network

269
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,399
hosts

270
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
enabling mutual discoverability so the

271
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
ability to like suppose you want to find

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
a printer on the stub network you can

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
even if you're on the infrastructure

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
network and vice versa

275
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
and also the ability to do things like

276
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
firmware downloads for hosts that are on

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
the stub network

278
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
it would also be nice uh

279
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,720
to be able to actually integrate the

280
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
stub network into the into the routing

281
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
infrastructure

282
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
of the network that's capable of doing

283
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
that um

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
and it would be nice to be able to

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,360
infrastruct

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
to integrate the discovery

287
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,360
infrastructure on the stub network into

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
the infrastructure on the

289
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
main network so that devices that are on

290
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
the stub network can be discovered not

291
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,800
only from

292
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
the adjacent infrastructure link but

293
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
from any link on the network

294
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
take mike out of stand hold in front of

295
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
face please stop turning away

296
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,880
sorry chris morrow google thank you

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,399
okay

298
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,720
all right so

299
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
um

300
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
some constraints uh we can't change the

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
existing network this is a huge problem

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
right like we we

303
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
actually looked at this problem in

304
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
homenet and came up with a solution but

305
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
the solution required a complete change

306
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,120
to how the devices on the on the home

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
network worked and that just didn't fly

308
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
we never that was a failure we never we

309
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
never managed to get any

310
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
home routers that anybody's shipping to

311
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
implement that so basically this has to

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
work without anything changing without

313
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839
the user having to buy a special router

314
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
for their home network that supports it

315
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
um

316
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
and also

317
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
like we can't really require changes to

318
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
host

319
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,279
on the infrastructure

320
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,320
because

321
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
once again you know the customers

322
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,079
already bought those hosts

323
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,600
it just has to work um

324
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
for devices that are connected to the

325
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
stub network there's kind of two two

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
scenarios one is you've got a a green

327
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
field network where you know you don't

328
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
already have an existing way that

329
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
devices on that network behave and so

330
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,399
it's okay to say how they behave and

331
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
uh you know the example would be you

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
know an iot network where

333
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,600
right now the iot network doesn't

334
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
support ip routing and so how it's going

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
to support ip routing is something that

336
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
we can define

337
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,279
uh

338
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
another example would be

339
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
like the double nat except

340
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
you uh

341
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,399
um

342
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,000
you don't wanna you wanna actually have

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,519
mutual discoverability and all that nice

344
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
stuff and in that case

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
hosts just have to work so

346
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,680
um

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
and then

348
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,639
just some topology constraints to keep

349
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,079
the problem

350
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,040
small

351
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
we don't want to do routing so stub

352
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,440
networks are not transit networks

353
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
um

354
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
it's possible there were some questions

355
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,560
that came up on the mailing list so i

356
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
just kind of kind of represented these

357
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
here it's it's totally possible for

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
there to be more than one stub router

359
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,199
connected to the stub network

360
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,199
that has to work um

361
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,720
it's possible

362
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,079
because we're the users are just going

363
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,600
to connect these to the networks right

364
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
like like we don't

365
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
we're we're explicitly assuming that the

366
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,040
user doesn't know how to operate our

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,240
network

368
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
they just buy devices and plug them

369
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
together and the devices have to kind of

370
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
figure out how to make it work

371
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
so

372
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
uh it's entirely possible that the user

373
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
could plug two routers two stub routers

374
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
that are connected to the same stub

375
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,680
network into different infrastructure

376
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,639
networks

377
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
and we at least have to acknowledge that

378
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
that situation can occur

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,920
and handle it somehow

380
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,839
so you know the obvious simple topology

381
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
is just you have a c router you have a

382
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
homeland you have a stub network you

383
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,519
have a single stub router very simple

384
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,399
um

385
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
but we also need to support this use

386
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
case where you just happen to have

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
two or n stub routers that are all

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
connected to the same stub network

389
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
and that's a topology that could cause

390
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
some problems

391
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,839
where you have uh you know you have a

392
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,040
home network

393
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
maybe you've got a wi-fi network in your

394
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
home and you've got a routed wi-fi

395
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,000
network in your garage that's on a

396
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,199
different ip

397
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,279
subnet and you've got stub routers

398
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
connected to both of them

399
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,680
that's got to work or at least not fail

400
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
uh

401
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,839
some assumptions about how we might

402
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,600
solve this problem we don't really want

403
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,519
to get into solutions but

404
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
um but

405
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,399
we'll talk a little bit about the

406
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
solution that we've already done

407
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
which

408
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,920
you know may or may not be what the

409
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
working group decides to to work on

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
um

411
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,920
but that solution uses ipv6 it uses

412
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
routing

413
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
and it uses dns service discovery to

414
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
provide

415
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
addressability routability and

416
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
discoverability

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
mutually between this the the stub

418
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,479
network and the infrastructure network

419
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
uh

420
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
so

421
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
and currently you know if you if you

422
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
connect your device to a home network

423
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
and try to discover a printer you're

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
probably going to use mdns which is

425
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
dnssd using multicast dns

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,839
it's widely supported pretty much every

427
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
device that you can buy supports dns sd

428
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
um

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
so that's the service discovery

430
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
technology that

431
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,759
that we've been talking about and using

432
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
um

433
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,839
and then uh just

434
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,519
uh okay yeah so this is the last slide

435
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,720
so um

436
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
so assuming that this is work that the

437
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
ietf wants to work on

438
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
um i think that there are some documents

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
that we need to write one of them would

440
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
just be the basic solution that

441
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
like you know delivers the minimum

442
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
viable product

443
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,279
um

444
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,320
i don't think there's any point in

445
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,839
having two documents for the minimum

446
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,079
minimum viable product because it's not

447
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
doesn't seem like it's that complicated

448
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
we could have like a discovery document

449
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
and a routing document but i don't know

450
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
that that's necessary um and it's

451
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
probably useful to have them together uh

452
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
but then we can also you know if that's

453
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,480
a success if we decide to work on that

454
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
and we succeed in producing it there are

455
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
some other things we could do

456
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
we could talk about the sort of stretch

457
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,519
goals integrating with

458
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,439
the actual routing infrastructure using

459
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
real g ways

460
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
on the stub network instead of ulas if

461
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
we if we go that way

462
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,160
um

463
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
and

464
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,799
you know integrating dnssd stuff so

465
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,119
that's basically the the uh

466
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
the problem statement

467
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
um

468
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
thank you

469
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,600
does anybody have clarifying questions

470
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,639
on anything ted said

471
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,799
okay

472
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
quick question like well this is not a

473
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,840
new problem right ted do you agree so if

474
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,039
what is driving this requirement now

475
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
so uh i mean

476
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
in a sense like we're here a little bit

477
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,320
late

478
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
um

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
and the reason we're here and not just

480
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,440
saying you know screw publish a document

481
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,559
somewhere else

482
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
is because this is really the meat and

483
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,679
bones of like ietf stuff like itf does

484
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,400
service discovery itf does ip addressing

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
and routing and so

486
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
it doesn't make sense in my mind to

487
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
publish a document that's specific to a

488
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,919
particular

489
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,120
um

490
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,039
uh

491
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,320
a particular

492
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
uh type of of networking stuff a

493
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
particular type of stub network i'd like

494
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,120
to have us i'd like us to document how

495
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,520
to make any sort of sub network work so

496
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
we've already

497
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
needed this to connect an iot network

498
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
to an infrastructure network and so

499
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,760
we've already done a bunch of work on

500
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,880
this and jonathan is going to be

501
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
presenting

502
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
on that

503
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
so that's kind of where this is coming

504
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
from that's that's what motivated us

505
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
originally we were we were really

506
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
interested in getting this this uh

507
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
sort of

508
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,559
802.15.4 mesh technology

509
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
connected to home networks and we just

510
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
didn't have a way to do it but we had

511
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
all the building blocks

512
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
and so we just put the building blocks

513
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
together and we kind of made it work but

514
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,640
it'd be nice to have a standard that

515
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
says how that happens

516
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
okay thanks maybe another follow-up just

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
quick follow-up right so you you

518
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,320
consider this as a routing problem or

519
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
you want to solve this more in the in

520
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the service discovery layer where do you

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
want to solve this

522
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
where will the solution set fit well so

523
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
the solution that we that we've

524
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
implemented is to use

525
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
router advertisements both to provide

526
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,080
reachability because remember we're

527
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
this is a constrained problem we're not

528
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
solving the whole problem of like the

529
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
home that tried to solve we're just

530
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
trying to solve the stub network problem

531
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
and for a stub network what we need is

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,280
to be able to get

533
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
ipv6 addressing on the stub network and

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
ipv6 addressing if it's not already

535
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,400
present

536
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
on the infrastructure link and we need

537
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,919
to be able to tell hosts on the

538
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
infrastructure link

539
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
what the route is to the stub network

540
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
and vice versa

541
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
so

542
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
uh so that's pretty simple you just use

543
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
router advertisements for that

544
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
and then uh for dnssd we've been doing a

545
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
bunch of work in the dns ssd working

546
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,480
group

547
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,520
um and uh so there's

548
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,480
uh this concept of an advertising proxy

549
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,679
and there's this concept of service

550
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
registration and so

551
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
devices in the constraint network that

552
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,039
we're talking about use the service

553
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,520
registration protocol which is a unicast

554
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,760
dns update protocol to

555
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
update an authoritative database and

556
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
then that authoritative database is

557
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
advertised on the infrastructure link

558
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,039
using

559
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
uh

560
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
multicast dns so

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
you'll hear more about that jonathan's

562
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
presentation okay thank you

563
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
thank you sri um carlos go next but um

564
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
before anybody joins a line can you also

565
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,640
join the line and the meet echo i know

566
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
michael right carlos is not and the line

567
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
is in a different order than this so

568
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
like yeah i think we'll go with the room

569
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,960
line and uh we'll go after that please

570
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
join the mythical queue as well thank

571
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,640
you

572
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
yes i mean i should probably pull out

573
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,159
the microphone like i'm doing because

574
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,200
yeah too far away yeah

575
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
i was trying to join the queue

576
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
was not successful quick question in the

577
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
topology that you presented did you

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
consider the possibility of like uh

579
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,880
those multi-link topologies like changes

580
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
on the topology dynamically so the start

581
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
network connects through one link and

582
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
then to through the other theme this is

583
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,200
in scope

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
yeah this is this is this all has to

585
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
work when things change

586
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
so you know these

587
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
think about the stub network router as

588
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
being essentially like a

589
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
from the from the user's point of view

590
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
it's just a it's just a home device like

591
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,120
they don't know that it's a stub network

592
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,559
router specifically i mean they kind of

593
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
do but

594
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
oh sorry

595
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
i'm waving my hand and so the mic is

596
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
pointing away and back um yeah so so

597
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
users don't really know they don't have

598
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,039
a mental model or we don't want to

599
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
require them to have a mental model so

600
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
yeah they have to be able to take that

601
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
device and plug it into a different

602
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,520
network or we have to prevent them from

603
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,440
doing it right one of the two

604
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
am i next go ahead michael like we'll

605
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,919
eat the line as it is right now

606
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,120
okay

607
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
um so um

608
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
this slide surprised me ted

609
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
um

610
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,960
so

611
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
you said to us it has to either work or

612
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
not break

613
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
and um so

614
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
since i have some knowledge of your

615
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
proposed solution i'm not sure how this

616
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
network either works or doesn't break

617
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
right actually could you could you

618
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,240
distinguish those those two things those

619
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
two statements of work versus not break

620
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
right that's a really good question and

621
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,720
and so the issue here this is a problem

622
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
we that we've run into

623
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,039
uh that you know you have devices that

624
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,679
are connected um

625
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,480
to

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,159
multiple networks and to the stub

627
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
network and

628
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
if you just

629
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
implement the stub network as you know

630
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
router advertisements pointing in two

631
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
directions

632
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
that kind of works but you have some

633
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
issues with the addressability on the

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
home home networks but the big problem

635
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,720
is

636
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
uh for a constrained network um you need

637
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
service discovery mutual service

638
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,600
discovery and doing mutual service

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,360
discovery on two different networks

640
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
where there isn't necessarily so in this

641
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
in this model here i've been kind of

642
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
generous and sort of implied that

643
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
there's an internal router that's doing

644
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,880
the right thing but actually in practice

645
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
if this is happening in someone's home

646
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
most likely it's a double net

647
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
and so

648
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
um so devices that are connected to the

649
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
garage land probably can't communicate

650
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
with devices that are connected the

651
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
homeland and so we've got this

652
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
because it's a it's a double nap

653
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,480
well they also can't connect to them

654
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
well at least in one direction

655
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,280
so yeah it's possible that we could make

656
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
any repeat michael's comments onto the

657
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,919
mic

658
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
sorry can you repeat michael's comments

659
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
onto the mic yeah so michael is saying

660
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
uh that he's asking whether

661
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
it's really true that the devices can't

662
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
communicate back and forth so in this in

663
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
this scenario with the garage land in

664
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
the homeland if you assume that the

665
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,360
internal router is a double nat a second

666
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,159
nat i should say um then

667
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,000
there should be connectivity in one

668
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
direction or the other and so one way to

669
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
solve the the problem of communicating

670
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
between devices like this so this stub

671
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
router if this is a constrained network

672
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,320
we don't want to be doing any kind of uh

673
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,440
heavy uh data transfer across the stub

674
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,520
network for example to replicate the um

675
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,279
the authoritative zone that we're

676
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,520
maintaining with srp

677
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,600
and so in order to prevent that from

678
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,799
happening

679
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,120
either we want to go around so we want

680
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,080
to use the internal router as a way to

681
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
communicate between

682
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
the stub this stub router and this stub

683
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,320
router so as to maintain that database

684
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,559
or

685
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,120
we want to just not have that service

686
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
available on one link so that the end

687
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,400
user realizes that they've screwed up

688
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,120
and

689
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
and unplugs a device

690
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,679
and moves it around

691
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
so so basically this is not a solved

692
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
problem like

693
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
we didn't come here with we did come

694
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
here with some solved some somewhat

695
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
solve problems we think we have a decent

696
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
solution it'd be really great if the itf

697
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
could tell us if it's a bad solution in

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,679
some way

699
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,600
um but this particular problem is not

700
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,760
actually solved and as i said there's

701
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,279
basically two ways to solve it one of

702
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,400
them is to

703
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
actually make communication work either

704
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,799
through the stub network or around it

705
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,400
and the other is to just say well this

706
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
configuration doesn't work so we're

707
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
going to detect it and we're going to

708
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,679
disable

709
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,200
stub routers that are connected to one

710
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
of the two networks

711
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
so that there's one network where

712
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
everything works right

713
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,080
and so

714
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,720
and and the end user isn't confused

715
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
the main goal is to have consistent

716
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
behavior

717
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,440
does that answer your question

718
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
okay well so this is this is this is a

719
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
question to to

720
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,960
he shook his head this is a question

721
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,000
that we can

722
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
discuss at length if we have a working

723
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,039
group

724
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,480
or like we have some time at the end of

725
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,919
the presentations to have a longer

726
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,320
discussion absolutely stuart go ahead

727
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
i'm stuart cheshire from apple

728
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
uh

729
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,039
ted presented a fairly generic overview

730
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,039
of the problem statement which is

731
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,480
appropriate for this ietf work um

732
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,559
but some people like me get the head

733
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,840
around things better if we have a

734
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,320
concrete example so i'm

735
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
i'm going to try giving a concrete

736
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,600
example

737
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
which is the genuine reason we're here

738
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
today

739
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,240
uh we have been working on

740
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,679
home automation

741
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,799
with homekits and now the mata protocol

742
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,159
from csa

743
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,480
we've also been working with thread

744
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,679
which is a

745
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,880
low power

746
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,360
uh low-speed wireless network suitable

747
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
for battery-powered devices

748
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
and

749
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
if you look at how

750
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
home networks have evolved

751
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
we started off with a pc with a modem

752
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
and then we had wi-fi and we had you

753
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,720
know maybe a pc and a laptop

754
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
and at every stage the easiest solution

755
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
is just to add one more device to the

756
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
wi-fi network and the whole home is a

757
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,039
big flat broadcast domain

758
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,360
and last time i checked i have a little

759
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,720
over 100 devices on my wi-fi network

760
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
and they're all talking to each other

761
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,520
with multicast dns which means all these

762
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,360
devices are being bothered by multicast

763
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
packets saying

764
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
are you the printer no i'm not the

765
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
printer stop asking me and as the

766
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,039
inventor of multicast dns you might be

767
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,480
surprised to hear me standing here

768
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,880
saying that but multicast dns was

769
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
designed 20 years ago when you had a

770
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
dozen things on a home network not a

771
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,039
hundred we knew when we started

772
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,720
that that was not the final solution

773
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
that was just one step along the journey

774
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,799
so

775
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,320
putting ourselves in the shoes of a

776
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
product maker today

777
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
if you want to make a smart home light

778
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
switch

779
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
you can have it on wi-fi

780
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
you can join the wi-fi network you can

781
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
be part of this big flat broadcast

782
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
domain

783
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
discovery works

784
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,919
one hop unicast communication works

785
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
and and the customer will probably be

786
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,559
happy and not return your product um

787
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,039
when we wanted thread which is much

788
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,399
lower power and much more appropriate

789
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
for battery devices

790
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
do we want to do the same thing do we

791
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
just want to bridge the broadcast

792
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
domains and flood all the traffic in

793
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,120
both directions well thread is a quarter

794
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,480
megabit network

795
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,200
and wi-fi is hundreds of megabits

796
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
um

797
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
continuing to make a bigger and bigger

798
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,919
broadcast domain in the house is not

799
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,240
scalable so that's what led us to this

800
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
work is

801
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
we're the ietf

802
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
we do routing we we have an internetwork

803
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,799
protocol not a lan protocol this is not

804
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
netbios this is not

805
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,080
novell network we actually have uh

806
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
structured ip addresses and routers that

807
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,480
forward packets and most home users are

808
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
making no use of that

809
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,120
so

810
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,279
can we make products that can be sold

811
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,880
into people's homes

812
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,320
that will work 99.9 of the time so they

813
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
don't generate

814
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,880
expensive product returns

815
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,559
without assuming that the customer

816
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
changes their home wi-fi changes the

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,840
home gateway

818
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
understands anything

819
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
they just plug these things in and they

820
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
automatically configure

821
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
we have done some work

822
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
uh in that direction and we have some

823
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,480
solutions but the reason we're here is

824
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
we don't know for sure those are the

825
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
best solutions

826
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,279
we think the work we've done has broader

827
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,440
applicability than just this narrow use

828
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,480
case of thread and at the same time

829
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,279
the expertise at the itf can help us

830
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
spot mistakes and do something that

831
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,960
works better for all of these scenarios

832
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,000
so

833
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
if anybody thinks that this is some

834
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,880
abstract

835
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,039
academic exercise we're doing it really

836
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,840
isn't it's trying to clear the way for

837
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
companies to make products that they can

838
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,640
sell

839
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,159
and not lose money on the returns and

840
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,840
have happy customers

841
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,600
i think it's sure eddie go ahead

842
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,360
all

843
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
eric line alleria so staying on the

844
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,559
slide but referring to something you

845
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
were talking about earlier it the

846
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,399
universe of things that any work

847
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,120
uh a a chartered working group might do

848
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
that that's out of scope is changing

849
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,720
anything that's in the home you're

850
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,600
saying

851
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,880
uh

852
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,120
is everything on the table for the stub

853
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
rooter can we specify

854
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,919
that it must have a satellite

855
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,840
interconnection or something i mean i'm

856
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,200
being i'm being i don't know why you'd

857
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,120
want to but facetious but like

858
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
or are we going to discover that there

859
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
is some install base

860
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,399
of stub network routers

861
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,159
then they themselves cannot be changed

862
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,720
and that will also constrain the work

863
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
that could be done uh so i i don't think

864
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,679
you know i i would be a little bit

865
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,679
surprised if we if we wandered far from

866
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,440
the solution that we already have

867
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
but um

868
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
if we did i would hope that it would be

869
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,440
for good reason

870
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,919
and so that would imply that that what

871
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,679
we're producing is better than the

872
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,000
solution that we came up with on our own

873
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,840
and

874
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,799
uh if that were the case then i would

875
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
like to see

876
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,679
the better solution deployed in those

877
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,679
existing routers which are all running

878
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,720
firmware that can be updated

879
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,799
automatically so so slightly less

880
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
facetiously and slightly more concretely

881
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,399
it would be okay to mandate an mdns

882
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
proxy

883
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
in these things just like i mean

884
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
speaking with my mdns hat on i'd say

885
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
hell no but but yeah

886
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,559
yeah in principle

887
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,320
like i would not be participating in

888
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,760
that particular

889
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,720
um consensus okay all right but but yeah

890
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
so obviously

891
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,840
such things could be on the table so

892
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,679
yeah absolutely yeah all right

893
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,880
thank you

894
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
um

895
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
go ahead and i'll take best of that

896
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,159
i'll pascal is in line remotely before

897
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,120
you pascal

898
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
mentioned a lot did the iot and

899
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
effectively this is

900
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
a kind of situation that we've been

901
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,600
discussing for many many years in the

902
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
iot working groups like cisco and earth

903
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,720
sislow and raw

904
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,960
and for

905
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
most of the case we've been looking at

906
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,679
we need either water if we go rotting if

907
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,600
we go deep and that's not what you're

908
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,960
after or we did if it's just one hop or

909
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,919
two hops but we have a clear structure

910
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,080
we did nd proxy

911
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
and what we did not do it was

912
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,279
create more than one prefix so what i'm

913
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,960
interested in and i want to understand

914
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,919
here is is it out of scope to maintain

915
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,559
the same prefix and all those links

916
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
or is it okay

917
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,919
i mean i understand we want to

918
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,320
the the broadcast domain that's fine but

919
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
but nd proxy can be your friend in this

920
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
situation otherwise

921
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
right so um we looked at that um that

922
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,720
was that was definitely an option right

923
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,399
because we there was already and i when

924
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,919
we started this work there was already

925
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
an ietf document that described

926
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,799
a backbone router that used nd proxy so

927
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,720
so we're totally familiar with that work

928
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
the reason we chose not to do that is

929
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
because it's not scalable

930
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,559
at least that was that was our belief so

931
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
the nice thing about routing is you just

932
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,880
you advertise a route and it's very

933
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,840
simple

934
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,960
the nasty thing about nd so consider for

935
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,399
example

936
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,840
this topology

937
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
so

938
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,399
we have nd proxy that means that now

939
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,799
these stub routers both have to have the

940
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,399
same neighbor table

941
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,919
they have to somehow maintain that

942
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,880
common neighbor table

943
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
and we need to be careful that we don't

944
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
do a lot of excess multicasts

945
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,120
so we want to because they're so i mean

946
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,799
we're talking about devices like the

947
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
devices that you can currently buy that

948
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
do this are things like homepod minis

949
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
and

950
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,159
uh apple tvs and i know google has a

951
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,840
couple of wi-fi routers that do it and

952
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
euro has some wi-fi routers that do it

953
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
um and also there's there's a company i

954
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,039
know of that i think has it in their

955
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,640
light bulb so

956
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
uh so that means you could have actually

957
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
quite a few of these stub routers and so

958
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,080
we need a technology that's going to

959
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,880
work in that situation um you know one

960
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,799
option would be to just say well okay

961
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,200
all the stub routers will elect a stub

962
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
router that will actually do the routing

963
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,799
that sort of solves the problem but then

964
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,679
you don't have redundancy um

965
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,199
you could do that and then that makes

966
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,560
the neighbor discovery problem a little

967
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,839
bit simpler

968
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,800
but

969
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,359
it's it's still got scalability issues

970
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
um and

971
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,760
you know i think for like a a network

972
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
with 30 devices it's

973
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,079
it's probably an okay solution but we

974
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,159
were trying to think like

975
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,520
what do we want to have happen in the

976
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
long term as opposed to what do we want

977
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,719
to happen in the short term

978
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,000
and so that's why we went with the

979
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,679
routing approach as opposed to the nd

980
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,599
proxy approach but but certainly the nd

981
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,040
proxy like like it could be that the

982
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
working group gets together and is like

983
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
oh well actually indie proxy was really

984
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,599
the right solution

985
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,119
in which case you know we'll wonder

986
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,000
often

987
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,599
and that'll be what gets published and

988
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,000
and we probably won't implement that but

989
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
but uh but that doesn't mean it's the

990
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,440
wrong answer so so i certainly encourage

991
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,359
you to to advocate that use case if you

992
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
think that's a better answer

993
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
but that's our goal is to come up with

994
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,760
the best solution that that can actually

995
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,320
be deployed as opposed to you know to

996
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
insist that we're right or something

997
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,040
like that

998
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,760
thank you thanks chet um

999
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
go ahead and then we'll take gmy from

1000
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
the remote my name is

1001
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,240
my question is um

1002
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,760
you must know these google wi-fi boxes

1003
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,800
so

1004
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
uh if you have a

1005
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
large i don't have a large house but if

1006
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
you have a large house why don't you buy

1007
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
several of them you put one also in the

1008
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,480
garage

1009
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
right and doesn't that solve the problem

1010
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,800
yes yes exactly so so i mean the good

1011
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,160
news about uh

1012
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,319
this

1013
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,119
topology as as you're pointing out as

1014
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,720
best i was pointing out the good news

1015
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
about this topology is that it usually

1016
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,839
doesn't happen anymore because normally

1017
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,440
nowadays people have

1018
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,680
mesh routers and so for example i have

1019
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,520
this exact topology in my house except

1020
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
that the internal router in this case

1021
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
is an ero

1022
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
and so

1023
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,079
it's just bridging between the homeland

1024
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
and the garage land and so those are two

1025
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,599
those are a single land and so we just

1026
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,599
don't have an issue with with

1027
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,040
this particular problem this this

1028
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
particular use case

1029
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
really

1030
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,599
in in my home

1031
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,599
it's actually this use case

1032
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,560
because because the homeland is is yes

1033
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
it's more than one

1034
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,000
uh there's more than one wi-fi access

1035
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
point

1036
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
but they're all in the same broadcast

1037
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,079
domain

1038
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,480
thank you thank you uh go ahead michael

1039
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,079
if you can go to the mic next genway

1040
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
uh okay hear me

1041
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
[Music]

1042
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,920
yeah we can hear you go ahead please

1043
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,359
okay

1044
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,800
i see in the green field example

1045
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,760
why we can require changes to the host

1046
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
because i think the host may be the

1047
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
general

1048
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,839
consumer devices and is installed the

1049
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,800
common operating system such as linux

1050
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,760
mac or even windows i think make some

1051
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,359
changes to the host is very hard

1052
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,280
how do you think

1053
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,880
yeah so that's why we distinguish

1054
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
between the ordinary use case and the

1055
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,560
greenfield use case in the greenfield

1056
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
use case we're assuming that the host

1057
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,359
doesn't actually have a way to solve

1058
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,440
this problem yet and so if that's the

1059
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
case then it doesn't matter if we change

1060
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
it because we're not

1061
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
we're always going to be putting a new

1062
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,839
implementation requirement on the host

1063
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,520
but in the ordinary example it's

1064
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,599
probably not reasonable to expect

1065
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,520
basically it

1066
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,640
what's going to what's going to

1067
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,280
determine whether whether the

1068
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
uh

1069
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,440
manufacturer implements these changes is

1070
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,119
whether they benefit from implementing

1071
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,520
these changes right so in the constraint

1072
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,599
network example um

1073
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,040
we're talking about a totally different

1074
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
network environment uh with new devices

1075
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
that haven't been sold on the market

1076
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
before

1077
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,480
and so yeah it's exactly the same amount

1078
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,079
of work to add this new functionality to

1079
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,839
those devices it would be to add them to

1080
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,560
the

1081
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,400
to like an iphone or something like that

1082
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,599
but the difference is that the

1083
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,119
manufacturer of the device that's going

1084
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,400
to connect to this

1085
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
greenfield network is motivated to do

1086
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
that and the manufacturer of the device

1087
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
that's going to connect to the ordinary

1088
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,119
network is not motivated to do that and

1089
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
so that's why i say that

1090
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
that in the greenfield example we can

1091
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
require changes to the host

1092
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
whereas in the ordinary example we can't

1093
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,200
it's not because it's easier in one case

1094
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,680
than in the other

1095
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
thank you michael go ahead

1096
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,240
uh um so um i think that that also that

1097
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,280
question um and eric asked that question

1098
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,079
can we assume that the routers uh can do

1099
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,400
that stub routers are greenfield and i

1100
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,640
think the answer is yes and you you had

1101
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,520
some

1102
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,400
some

1103
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
uh you know well maybe blah blah blah

1104
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,760
but i think that we can assume that we

1105
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
can we can do anything we like as eric

1106
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,240
said including adding a a satellite or a

1107
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
loon uh connection to them right if

1108
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
that's if that's what the working group

1109
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,079
consensus is yeah um but um i want you

1110
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,800
to go back to your your um slide with

1111
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,160
the uh double

1112
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,040
stub

1113
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,320
that that one yeah no no yeah no

1114
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,240
that one yes yeah um so um

1115
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,000
so i actually think that it's quite

1116
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
reasonable that we do do some kind of

1117
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,599
election

1118
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,599
on them as long as we do it on the stub

1119
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,560
network

1120
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
not in the other network and i i think

1121
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,000
that should be something that we should

1122
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,839
think about but

1123
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,880
um

1124
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,760
and i know you know this um so the

1125
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,599
situation where people would put this

1126
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,200
kind of scenario

1127
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,720
is one where

1128
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
they have a smart speaker and they want

1129
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
to have one in several rooms

1130
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,720
and

1131
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,640
they don't always have connectivity from

1132
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,040
the upstairs to the downstairs and

1133
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
sometimes they do

1134
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,440
and sometimes they close that metal door

1135
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
or the door that has metal in it and the

1136
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,200
stub network uh partitions

1137
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
right okay and so those partitions are

1138
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,119
completely random right you know you let

1139
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
the cat out the door

1140
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,160
up and down the network reconverges for

1141
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,760
three and a half seconds

1142
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,640
and then

1143
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,800
partitions again yep right

1144
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,560
um and sometimes you leave the door open

1145
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,520
all day

1146
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,760
right okay or sometimes you have a you

1147
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,880
know i've heard that a tinted windows

1148
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
you know that change based to to keep

1149
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,040
the sun in and out that they're really

1150
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
good at reflecting em waves around

1151
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,720
corners

1152
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
but when they're clear

1153
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,560
they're letting the sun in they don't

1154
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
reflect

1155
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,079
things you're learning everything yes

1156
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,440
yeah so so the point is that stub

1157
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
network is just a mess yeah of of things

1158
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,359
and that's why people want to put

1159
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,280
multiple stub routers is so that they

1160
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,839
can uh have connectivity to all these

1161
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160
other low-power devices and they want to

1162
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
use the homeland as a

1163
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,200
backhaul right much like like pascal has

1164
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,800
described

1165
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,640
and so

1166
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,400
you know there's a bunch of different

1167
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
options but basically we're just we're

1168
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
trying to just keep the network going

1169
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
yeah that's what it really amounts to

1170
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,680
right

1171
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,960
hi

1172
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
philip diesel um

1173
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,839
so if we are talking about scoping of

1174
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,720
the um of this potential working group

1175
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,480
my question would be

1176
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,720
what network technologies do you think

1177
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,200
of in the stub network so if you're

1178
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,359
thinking that it it's it's ethernet like

1179
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
most networks today this this is

1180
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,000
certainly easier if you as if you

1181
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
envisioned something like six lopan

1182
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,720
on a stop network

1183
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
and so

1184
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,240
is there already an idea

1185
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,359
how we want to scope that

1186
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,680
so you want me to take this yeah yeah so

1187
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,599
like philip that's like really open to

1188
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,280
discussion right so that's something we

1189
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,200
can like there is like a proposal for a

1190
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,440
charter that like ted put up but that's

1191
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,960
something that's open to discussion

1192
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
today and like further on the mailing

1193
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,400
list as well so that's

1194
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,240
we should be flexible on that thank you

1195
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,839
yeah thanks

1196
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,160
so um thanks a lot ted i think the the

1197
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,839
exhausted the mic line

1198
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,880
and

1199
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,200
thank you very much for

1200
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,399
doing this well uh jonathan please

1201
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,800
um

1202
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,040
but i think the question is

1203
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,319
is this

1204
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,160
writing a

1205
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,359
given

1206
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,119
requirements

1207
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,839
type document that

1208
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,599
if you're building you know that there

1209
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,000
is this product category

1210
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
and if you're building a product for

1211
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,680
this category

1212
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,280
but

1213
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,640
the other possibility is that

1214
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
so many perceived that

1215
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,480
while we have pieces a b and c

1216
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,599
that we have gaping holes right

1217
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,560
no and thank you for bringing that up

1218
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,920
because you know unfortunately i made

1219
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,359
these slides in more of a hurry than i

1220
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,960
intended to and i didn't think to hit

1221
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,720
that particular point

1222
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,599
um

1223
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,720
yeah so uh

1224
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,359
it would be really nice if this were

1225
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,359
just like rfc 7084 for stub networks i

1226
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,680
don't think that we can quite do that

1227
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,000
but definitely you know certainly when

1228
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,760
we did the the thread border router

1229
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,680
implementation and i think you know my

1230
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,880
hope for this working group would be

1231
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,480
that this is the case there is here as

1232
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,280
well

1233
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
is that um

1234
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,599
we didn't want to invent a whole new

1235
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,760
protocol suite right the goal here is

1236
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,640
not to create something like hncp for

1237
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,000
stub networks

1238
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,240
um it's more to say like here's what you

1239
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,560
need to do with ras to make this piece

1240
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,800
work here's what you need to do with

1241
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720
with uh neighbor discovery to make this

1242
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,800
piece work that's what i think we're

1243
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,480
going to wind up doing that's that's

1244
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,680
what we did with the thread border

1245
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,640
router

1246
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
um whether i'm correct about that is

1247
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,800
something that we need to talk about so

1248
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
and and you know i said deliverables was

1249
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
just the solution but actually you raise

1250
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
a really good point which is maybe we

1251
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,240
actually should have

1252
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,880
some just some some more analysis before

1253
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,160
we do the

1254
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,000
the uh

1255
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,560
the solution document

1256
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,160
are the yeah

1257
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,078
and for each of the challenges

1258
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
solutions

1259
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,520
right so

1260
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,680
yeah

1261
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
so you might want to read the draft

1262
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,839
lemon problem statement subnetworks

1263
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,960
problem statement document

1264
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
okay

1265
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,359
okay yeah thanks ryan like can i just

1266
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,640
add something so there is like a

1267
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,319
proposed charter that was discussed on

1268
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,760
the mailing list so we just threw it up

1269
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,760
so in a roundabout way it covers like

1270
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,200
what you want to cover but maybe it can

1271
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,119
be made more crisp what it says is like

1272
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,480
these are the functionalities that are

1273
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,960
required like so that in the stub router

1274
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,920
that's in the charter and the

1275
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,000
deliverable and there's a non-goal in

1276
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
the charter it says like we're gonna try

1277
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,280
to use existing protocols as much as

1278
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,760
possible right so both of these together

1279
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,599
read into what you say but maybe we can

1280
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,079
make it a little bit more uh explicit

1281
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,599
saying that hey we are trying to not

1282
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,119
reinvent the wheel as much as possible

1283
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,359
here

1284
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,520
yeah

1285
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,560
that's absolutely that's that's a what

1286
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
we did and b definitely the goal

1287
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,440
okay

1288
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,280
thanks

1289
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,079
jonathan please come on

1290
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,719
[Music]

1291
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,800
right

1292
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
can people hear me okay there we go

1293
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,560
yeah so i'm jonathan hui for those of

1294
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,960
you don't know me uh affiliated with

1295
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,160
google i'm here to present uh the use a

1296
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
concrete use case of the work that we're

1297
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,599
trying to

1298
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,319
uh drive forward here within the itf uh

1299
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,480
which both stuart and ted have already

1300
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,440
kind of highlighted or previewed uh in a

1301
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,119
few times already but

1302
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,760
just to make it more concrete for people

1303
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,640
here

1304
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,839
uh especially those that are not

1305
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,200
involved with thread

1306
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,119
next slide please so what is thread next

1307
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,359
claim

1308
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,839
so i think stuart already mentioned this

1309
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
we like to think of thread as a low

1310
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,640
power alternative to wi-fi

1311
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,240
one of its target

1312
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
application layers that it's supporting

1313
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,240
is this protocol called matter

1314
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,960
matter is an ipv6 based application

1315
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,520
layer and it's intended at least in its

1316
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,359
initial version to work across both

1317
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,480
wi-fi

1318
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
and thread thread you know supporting

1319
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,760
low power battery operated devices

1320
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,599
and the intent there is for matter to

1321
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,000
work seamlessly end to end right just

1322
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,359
using ipv6 whether it's wi-fi or threat

1323
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,839
next

1324
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,839
slide about this data is about six

1325
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,680
months old now but this is the last time

1326
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,440
they've publicly provided any uh data on

1327
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
the number of devices that are

1328
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,520
uh you know coming out with matter

1329
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,280
by the end of this year or early next

1330
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,400
year

1331
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,200
but there is 134 devices that are

1332
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,720
currently implementing matter and going

1333
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,160
through testing

1334
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,960
from about 53 different companies

1335
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,800
that is the largest

1336
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,280
test event that csa has

1337
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,760
had and about half and half is the split

1338
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
between devices that support wi-fi and

1339
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,079
devices that support thread

1340
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,559
next slide

1341
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
but even though i am talking a lot about

1342
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,040
matter i want to stress that thread is a

1343
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,839
generic ipv6 transport right the the

1344
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,599
goal here is to provide

1345
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,480
you know

1346
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,319
ipv6 connectivity

1347
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,119
uh to any set of application layers uh

1348
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:43,920
and

1349
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,000
having them run simultaneously right we

1350
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,920
really do believe in that vision where

1351
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
ip is the convergence of a multi-service

1352
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,000
network

1353
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,920
so you know we have existing products

1354
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,280
that are being

1355
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,839
delivered using weave which is a

1356
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,599
iot application layer for google

1357
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,040
products

1358
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,599
homekit as was already mentioned is

1359
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,920
already shipping with thread

1360
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,880
as a link technology and then looking

1361
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,480
forward a little bit matter i already

1362
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,680
talked about

1363
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,480
knx is a building

1364
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,839
building automation communication

1365
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:16,960
technology

1366
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,119
and then dolly is a commercial lighting

1367
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,440
communication technology which have also

1368
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,359
both uh announced that they will be

1369
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,119
bringing thread to their solutions uh in

1370
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,480
later this year

1371
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,359
uh next slide

1372
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,000
uh yeah just real quick uh the key

1373
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,559
points to call out with thread is that

1374
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,839
it is based on ieee 8215.4 the same

1375
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,760
radio that's used in zigbee

1376
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,480
uh the phi is the oqpsk 2.4 gigahertz uh

1377
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,520
quarter megabit per second data rate

1378
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,839
uh the other thing to call out is the

1379
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,559
frame mtu is 127 bytes

1380
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,119
right so when you talk about uh the

1381
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,000
mac overhead you know media access

1382
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,839
uh this link really is only providing

1383
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,319
about tens of kilobits per second right

1384
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,440
data rate

1385
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,920
um it is six low pan base so four nine

1386
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,480
four four and six two eight two uh using

1387
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
those technologies to transport ipv6

1388
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,000
datagrams

1389
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,480
next slide

1390
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,119
and then there is a lot of stuff going

1391
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,800
on within thread but i just wanted to

1392
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
call out some of the high level

1393
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,079
properties of it and gets into something

1394
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,640
that was already mentioned earlier

1395
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,079
in this session but

1396
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,359
thread is a mesh topology

1397
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,119
thread devices form discover routes

1398
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,280
multiple hops if they're not directly

1399
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,520
within range

1400
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,800
and next slide

1401
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,760
thread devices connect into

1402
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,400
uh other link technologies like wi-fi

1403
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,240
through devices what we call border

1404
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,960
routers right and thread was designed to

1405
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,000
be

1406
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,160
no single point of failure and so a

1407
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,319
thread topology can have multiple border

1408
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,760
routers active simultaneously providing

1409
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,960
connectivity between thread networks and

1410
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,839
non-threat networks

1411
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,200
uh and to really this this is a concrete

1412
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,119
problem right these are products that

1413
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,480
are shipping today they have been

1414
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,319
shipping in some cases for multiple

1415
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,200
years

1416
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,440
uh i you know i think

1417
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,760
best answer is in that we have about

1418
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,079
tens of millions of these devices total

1419
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,680
deployed already in market um that have

1420
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,880
uh 15.4 radios in them and have

1421
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,079
had announcements that they will be

1422
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,559
upgraded to thread the latest version of

1423
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,800
thread to support better but in many of

1424
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,880
these cases they're already running

1425
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,680
some version of thread

1426
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,599
you know already

1427
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,400
next slide

1428
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,960
uh so yeah we talked about uh what's the

1429
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,079
topology look like uh from a stub

1430
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,839
networking perspective so even if you

1431
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,240
look at a single thread network right as

1432
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,680
michael talked about

1433
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,079
uh that thread network may appear as a

1434
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,599
single cohesive topology may appear as

1435
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,520
separate you know physically connected

1436
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,359
topologies because you know just the way

1437
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,280
the radio connectivity works

1438
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,680
and so it could be that you know the

1439
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,000
border routers are servicing the same

1440
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
mesh topology and are connected through

1441
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,760
the stub network or it could be that

1442
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,599
they're only connected through the

1443
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,000
infrastructure network itself

1444
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,400
uh and this is dynamic right this device

1445
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,480
may come and go uh there may be other

1446
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,920
you know the steel door opening and

1447
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,160
shutting that is affecting this uh

1448
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,359
connectivity

1449
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,839
next slide

1450
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,960
yeah so dynamic merging right if if

1451
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,119
connectivity comes back then the those

1452
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,440
those uh stub networks can combine

1453
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,359
into a single stub network next slide

1454
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,839
next slide please thanks

1455
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,440
all right next slide

1456
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
um so stewart mentioned this a little

1457
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,400
bit already

1458
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,160
uh with the home network that we're used

1459
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
to today it's a single broadcast domain

1460
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,599
all devices connected uh you know within

1461
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,520
a single ip hop next slide

1462
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,160
but when we look to attaching a thread

1463
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,119
network

1464
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,559
we don't want to just bridge that

1465
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,720
network right it's it is a

1466
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,520
highly constrained low data rate network

1467
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
we we really do want to isolate all of

1468
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,839
the multicast and other traffic that's

1469
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,920
happening on the wi-fi from the thread

1470
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,559
network and that's why uh you know with

1471
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,480
thread so far we've chosen to have that

1472
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,760
connected in

1473
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,760
as a separate uh

1474
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,680
as a separate network

1475
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,440
uh jonathan i think ran has like a

1476
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,559
clarifying question oh yeah sure

1477
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,839
yes

1478
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,119
sorry we cannot hear whoever is talking

1479
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,520
right now

1480
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,319
sorry

1481
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,240
no so uh jonathan can i just repeat

1482
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,680
because i think there might be some

1483
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,960
audio issue

1484
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,240
so uh if i can summarize rand's question

1485
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,799
uh quickly so rana's asking this purple

1486
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,799
pentagon that's in the picture why

1487
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,440
doesn't it have a zigbee radio uh would

1488
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,640
would that be a fair summary of your

1489
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,880
question ryan ran is shaking his head

1490
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,319
for the people who are remote thank you

1491
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,680
yeah that's fair

1492
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,839
so i'll just bring it back to this uh

1493
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,640
sorry i lost it

1494
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,319
i'll bring it back to this slide so the

1495
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,280
answer is it can right so the these

1496
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
products here this is a google wi-fi

1497
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,000
access point these are euro access wi-fi

1498
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,280
access points

1499
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,000
um they do include thread radios right

1500
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,440
not every access point includes a thread

1501
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,400
radio

1502
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,040
today maybe tomorrow if thread becomes

1503
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,520
pervasive but we have to assume that in

1504
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,440
some networks they do include a thread

1505
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,319
radio and in some networks they don't

1506
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,680
and so you do see a lot of other

1507
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,799
products

1508
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,040
uh that are not your wi-fi access points

1509
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,000
right

1510
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
that are that allow

1511
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,240
users to easily add thread to their home

1512
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,799
without having to swap out their wi-fi

1513
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,240
access points

1514
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,319
i guess

1515
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,040
it got turned off somehow

1516
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,200
so ron let me put that question back to

1517
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,400
you

1518
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,760
if you're listening

1519
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,680
hello ron i'm answering your question

1520
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,720
so i wanted to answer your question ryan

1521
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,160
you asked

1522
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,640
why doesn't the home gateway have this

1523
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,720
one dollar radio in it

1524
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,520
my question to you is does yours

1525
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,760
at home right now

1526
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,599
you want to buy a five dollar light bulb

1527
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,880
which you're told you can control

1528
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,240
remotely

1529
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
you take that light bulb home

1530
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,960
does your home gateway have a

1531
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,480
zigbee radio

1532
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,440
okay

1533
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,280
is that a safe assumption for a product

1534
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,040
maker that every customer they might

1535
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,280
sell to has a home gateway that does

1536
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,280
that

1537
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,480
i'm suggesting that there are more

1538
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,240
topologies

1539
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,559
than have been shown here

1540
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,960
and one of the obvious long-term

1541
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,480
topologies

1542
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,640
is that the zigbee radio

1543
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,839
goes into the cable modem or the dsl

1544
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,640
modem or the whatever that is also the

1545
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,160
ip router that is also the wi-fi thing i

1546
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,559
think that's an inevitability that's not

1547
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,240
a short-term fix

1548
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,119
but it's a topology that the group as a

1549
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,319
whole

1550
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,599
ought to be thinking about right

1551
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,880
right there are going to be a lot of

1552
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
topologies but that's one of them that's

1553
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,799
represented by these products here yeah

1554
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,480
so let me just reiterate something that

1555
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
michael said earlier which i think uh

1556
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,760
speaks

1557
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,599
oh this is ted i'm sorry yeah so

1558
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,799
something that michael said earlier

1559
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,240
which i think really speaks to rand's

1560
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,200
question is even if your router has that

1561
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,440
device in it that doesn't fully solve

1562
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,119
your problem because what if some of

1563
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,880
your mesh devices are not close enough

1564
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,400
to that router

1565
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,160
and not close enough to any other mesh

1566
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,319
device that they can reach that router

1567
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,559
through either through a mesh device or

1568
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,799
directly and if the answer to that is no

1569
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,559
then you probably need more mesh routers

1570
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,440
than just that one and so that's that's

1571
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,200
you know part of the idea with the with

1572
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,880
the thread mesh certainly

1573
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,000
is that it's a self-healing

1574
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,480
self-managing network that works even if

1575
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,280
you have gaps in physical

1576
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,640
connectivity as long as you have

1577
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,799
devices connected to the backbone

1578
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,000
that are

1579
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,880
also

1580
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,079
connected to the thread network

1581
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,520
uh michael richardson said even if

1582
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,599
you're having a dispute with the isp for

1583
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,640
the people or remote thank you

1584
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
so i do want to be clear that um i'm not

1585
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,000
disagreeing with ran that it would be

1586
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,559
lovely if that purple

1587
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,359
pentagon the the home gateway that the

1588
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,200
the customer already has their cable

1589
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,280
modem whatever it is

1590
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,240
be wonderful if that had a thread radio

1591
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,119
in it as well rand says his already has

1592
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,880
and i'd love to hear from you afterwards

1593
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,640
what product is using because i'm not

1594
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,720
aware of any such products

1595
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,480
um

1596
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,160
that would be wonderful but that does

1597
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,799
not it is not the reality today

1598
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,400
and it's not going to magically happen

1599
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,040
overnight because if nobody can sell

1600
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,960
thread light bulbs because no customer

1601
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,040
can use them then there's no market for

1602
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,119
that if there's no market for that why

1603
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,160
would any cable modem vendor add this

1604
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,480
capability that no customers asking for

1605
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,079
this is always the problem in networking

1606
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,720
is the chicken and egg problem so

1607
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,040
we need a transition that gets us to

1608
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,359
this glorious future where every home

1609
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,200
gateway has threat i'm sure jonathan

1610
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,720
would love to see that we'd all love to

1611
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
see that but we need some way to get

1612
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,880
from here to there

1613
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,760
thank you

1614
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,359
go ahead chris

1615
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,200
chris morrow

1616
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,960
some of the problem here is that there

1617
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,200
are multiple different transport layers

1618
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,280
and they may or may not exist

1619
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,960
and that a single device may have more

1620
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,839
than one transport link

1621
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,280
and it doesn't matter what the transport

1622
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,200
is really anyway it's the upper layer

1623
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,119
protocol that you care about so i think

1624
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,040
describing the problem in that

1625
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,319
sort of in that way as opposed to

1626
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,240
letting people infer it i think rand's

1627
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,319
comment about like oh why does it just

1628
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,760
have the right radio okay i have a new

1629
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
radio does it have that one no

1630
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,200
right that's not the problem it's not

1631
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
the radio that's a problem it's multiple

1632
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,520
links that's right

1633
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,520
yep

1634
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,359
all right so the next set of slides here

1635
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,559
i just wanted to give a little bit of

1636
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,799
preview and this is really talking to

1637
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,559
some of the stuff that ted and stuart

1638
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,920
were mentioning

1639
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,960
into

1640
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,880
you know this this stuff is shipping

1641
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,119
today right and so what do we decide to

1642
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,200
do right now right so

1643
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,680
uh one is you know how do we provide

1644
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,640
ipv6 reachability uh in thread border

1645
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,680
routers

1646
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,520
uh so the first step

1647
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,960
really is to configure the networks

1648
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,720
uh with the appropriate

1649
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,240
scope uh ipv6 addresses right we link

1650
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,000
local addressing doesn't work uh it's

1651
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,599
not sufficient for

1652
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,680
wi-fi devices to talk to thread devices

1653
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,920
and vice versa right so one of the

1654
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,680
actions of the border router really is

1655
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,480
to one discover whether or not there is

1656
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,400
a usable prefix available on that link

1657
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
and if they're not is not one

1658
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,240
then it has to go ahead and configure

1659
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,079
that and how does it do that well router

1660
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,319
advertisements with prefix information

1661
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,799
options right on the wi-fi side

1662
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,520
but thread has kind of a analogous

1663
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,839
mechanism but we don't need to

1664
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,440
get into the details of that there but

1665
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,799
you can think about it as just

1666
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,559
configuring a prefix

1667
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,319
with the appropriate scope

1668
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,200
and it is a ula right so it locally

1669
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,839
generates that at random

1670
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,520
and then advertises that in a router

1671
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,200
advertisement

1672
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,640
now once it has

1673
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,720
appropriate scoped addressing

1674
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,000
then it has to also advertise the routes

1675
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,400
so that devices on the wi-fi side know

1676
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,680
how to

1677
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,400
access devices on thread and vice versa

1678
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,559
and so how does it do that well

1679
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,760
it uses uh router advertisements with uh

1680
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,000
route info options

1681
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,079
uh inside of it right so

1682
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,040
all existing als you know

1683
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,640
encodings that are already defined in

1684
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,079
rfcs

1685
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,240
but you know as ted mentioned i think

1686
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,400
some of the behaviors of

1687
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,240
how do i detect whether there's a usable

1688
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,280
prefix when do i generate a prefix

1689
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,119
if i have multiple border routers how do

1690
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,079
they

1691
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,799
you know coordinate or you know figure

1692
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,680
out

1693
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,280
rather than having everyone generate

1694
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,440
their own prefix at the same time right

1695
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,039
so some of that behavior

1696
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,440
is not really defined today right and

1697
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,319
that's

1698
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,799
kind of some of the stuff that we had to

1699
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:17,839
do

1700
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,599
in the thread border routers for this to

1701
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,079
to be scalable

1702
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,160
now we also talked about dns service

1703
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,359
discovery

1704
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,599
um so this is really just pulling on a

1705
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,599
lot of the work in the the dns sd

1706
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,880
working group

1707
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,599
right the we wanted to avoid mdns

1708
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,240
because multicast is expensive and

1709
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,240
thread is a low

1710
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,039
you know

1711
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,799
low bandwidth link

1712
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,720
and so you know how to how do thread

1713
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,200
devices publish services that they offer

1714
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,839
so we in thread we use srp

1715
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,640
and in srp it's just a unicast update

1716
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,440
uh to a thread border router that's

1717
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,440
border router implementing an srp

1718
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,880
registrar

1719
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,640
and the thread border router

1720
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,960
uses that srp database

1721
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,039
along with an advertising proxy to make

1722
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,960
those services available

1723
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
discoverable on the wi-fi infrastructure

1724
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,799
link

1725
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,640
right and so in that case the wi-fi

1726
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,839
devices continue to use mdns to discover

1727
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,559
services uh published by thread

1728
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,960
but that multicast stops at the border

1729
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,880
router and doesn't uh go into the thread

1730
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,280
network

1731
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,520
so how do thread devices discover

1732
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,079
services on the wi-fi side

1733
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,400
rather than using mdns directly they can

1734
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,960
send a unicast dns query to a thread

1735
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,400
border router

1736
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,480
and then the border router

1737
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,079
implements a discovery proxy which

1738
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,559
translates that into an mdns query on

1739
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,640
the wi-fi side

1740
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,240
you know gets the response and then

1741
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,640
provides that in a unicast response to

1742
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,799
the thread device so again avoiding all

1743
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,440
of the multicast overhead that's

1744
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,400
on the thread side

1745
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,200
great

1746
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,119
so yeah it was intended to be really

1747
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,799
quick but also provide

1748
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,760
uh some more concrete

1749
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,559
um

1750
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,920
kind of background on on thread and

1751
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,480
why this work is important to thread

1752
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,160
thanks a lot thank you very much for

1753
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,079
coming and sharing the three use case

1754
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,319
thanks a lot uh michael i know you're

1755
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,319
ready

1756
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,839
the x stand on the x

1757
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,839
so do we now have it all

1758
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,599
we still don't see the remote people

1759
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
right

1760
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,440
nope um they're going to fix it after

1761
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,160
they're going to fix it afterwards okay

1762
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,400
uh hi my name is michael richardson and

1763
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,599
uh michael just

1764
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,039
pascal did you have a question for

1765
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,640
jonathan or

1766
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,039
if you have a question yes

1767
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,839
thank you

1768
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,440
yes one question is it okay that i ask

1769
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,160
it

1770
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,920
yeah go ahead yeah

1771
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,280
okay uh so uh i'm john

1772
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,720
great to see you again it's been a while

1773
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,640
so very happy to see you there

1774
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,000
um

1775
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,480
my question was about the the networks

1776
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,160
joining and splitting that you've shown

1777
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,680
on one slide

1778
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,079
and remember there was one where you you

1779
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,760
could see two groups and this is little

1780
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,200
guy in the middle i don't know if you

1781
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,000
can bring back this slide

1782
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,799
maybe it's too late

1783
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,880
but basically um what you've what you've

1784
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,200
done for service discovery is exactly

1785
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,599
the way we do as well for nd proxy

1786
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,920
because i mentioned in the proxy earlier

1787
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,160
so this exact system that you you

1788
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,960
explained for service registration

1789
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,440
is the way six le pen does

1790
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,119
also for addresses so that's um how we

1791
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,280
maintain a single prefix

1792
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,599
across the wi-fi backbone

1793
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,280
and the

1794
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,559
multiple

1795
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,960
not thread but multiple iot networks and

1796
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,839
the reason we've been doing that is

1797
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:58,799
because

1798
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,359
of joining and splitting of the network

1799
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,119
so there is another slide actually it's

1800
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,680
not this one it's before that one

1801
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,599
it's a slide where you could show that

1802
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,520
the thread network was actually split

1803
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,759
um

1804
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,920
and and my question here is basically

1805
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,000
yes basically this scenario

1806
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,559
it is it is the one that that

1807
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,760
we looked at uh at six low for large

1808
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,400
factories with thousands of nodes around

1809
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,480
multiple of those gateways

1810
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,640
and the nodes possibly moving inside the

1811
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,640
factory and we did not want them to

1812
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,000
remember

1813
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,480
and so so that's why we ended up uh

1814
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,799
doing the nd proxy ac tell this year uh

1815
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,640
we ended up doing the nd proxy and

1816
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,880
routing inside the steps and you're well

1817
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,599
aware of of that uh to nothing i'm just

1818
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,440
wondering if you if you're doing a

1819
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,039
different

1820
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,680
writing uh in in

1821
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,200
well not different writing but different

1822
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,599
dressing in the two steps when the

1823
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,240
drawing splits and do the node have to

1824
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,720
form new ipv6 addresses depending on

1825
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,799
reachability to gateways i mean how does

1826
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,359
that happen

1827
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,240
i didn't actually hear the question very

1828
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,760
clearly

1829
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,480
oh okay so so

1830
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,280
i was saying in in a case like this

1831
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,520
the reason why we did proxy we discussed

1832
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,000
earlier is because we did not want the

1833
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,839
devices to remember that's really the

1834
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,480
reason why and so

1835
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,559
there is in in the usual six-layer

1836
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,640
networks there is a single prefix for

1837
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,880
the whole thing so the guys can move to

1838
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,039
the left to the right etc

1839
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,079
and the question to jonathan since in

1840
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,720
thread they are apparently

1841
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,960
um creating a new

1842
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,160
prefix inside each step

1843
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,280
what happens when the steps merge join

1844
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,359
people are more on the left or more on

1845
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,280
the right do they have to remember i

1846
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,599
mean how does that work

1847
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,720
yeah so uh so indeed uh if there's a

1848
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,799
network partition then

1849
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,760
renumbering is gonna have to happen

1850
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,000
and and not moving right i mean it's not

1851
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,680
i mean partition is one thing but

1852
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,440
basically nodes moving

1853
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,200
say this is a big factory and there are

1854
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,760
robots throughout the factory and and

1855
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,599
they are moving with their devices

1856
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,679
crossing going left or right and the

1857
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,359
shortest path to the wi-fi

1858
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,279
infrastructure is sometimes for one

1859
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,600
gateway sometimes for another

1860
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
and having to remember is kind of

1861
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,679
impractical in that space

1862
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,279
i mean that that's that's that was well

1863
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,640
pascal this is ted lemon by the way

1864
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,719
pascal that um that particular question

1865
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,920
that you're asking i don't think is

1866
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,439
actually as interesting a question as

1867
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,600
you're as you're suggesting it is

1868
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,279
and the reason i say that is because um

1869
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,080
what you in a in a mesh network it's

1870
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,520
just gonna it's just going to um

1871
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,600
it's gonna it's gonna the mesh topology

1872
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,040
is going to change as the robot's moving

1873
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,560
around

1874
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,520
um

1875
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,479
which isn't ideal actually but uh but

1876
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,198
you you can't really avoid that and so

1877
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,479
in that case the robot's not going to

1878
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,000
renumber it's just it's going to keep

1879
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,359
the same ip address the whole time it's

1880
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,560
just going to be in a different place in

1881
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,479
the mesh topology

1882
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,799
i uh in either case i think it's not a

1883
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,799
clarifying question for jonathan so if

1884
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,158
you want we can discuss this a little

1885
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,600
bit later but i kind of want to have

1886
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,040
michael talk about it so we'll have some

1887
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,319
time for this question at the end thank

1888
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,920
you thank you thank you thanks pascal uh

1889
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,279
if you have like undersold questions we

1890
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,640
can take it up in the discussion time

1891
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,198
okay thank you

1892
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,000
hi

1893
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,439
i think that we're problem is that we're

1894
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:30,960
using this laptop it's supposed to be

1895
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,520
projecting something but we're doing it

1896
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,439
okay um so hi my name is michael

1897
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,040
richardson so i'm going to talk a little

1898
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,279
bit like what uh about a kind of

1899
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,198
alternate use case that and i'm going to

1900
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,880
say we came to it backwards where we

1901
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,799
were looking at the solution and going i

1902
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,719
wonder if it would work here

1903
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,960
and then so we decided we better explain

1904
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,238
what here was

1905
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,199
um and

1906
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,679
the other interesting thing about this

1907
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,080
was that some of the requests that came

1908
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,199
internally uh were some of it got lost

1909
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,960
in translation and we got went back and

1910
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,520
forth a bit and finally realized what

1911
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,760
their actual problem was and i then they

1912
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,159
actually said internally they said well

1913
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,679
actually you know

1914
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,520
this was what it was not the thing we

1915
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,120
were thinking about you know several

1916
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,600
months ago um so that was kind of a a

1917
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,640
weird

1918
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,480
uh learning process

1919
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,120
um so basically what we're talking about

1920
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,239
is

1921
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,960
uh buildings and uh i kept wanting to

1922
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,880
put in die hard pictures in the middle

1923
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,679
of this

1924
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,280
um because

1925
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,360
you know it's one of those cases where

1926
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,600
uh what was uh um

1927
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,159
science fiction uh uh

1928
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,159
scenarios from a movie and you suddenly

1929
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,920
realize you're implementing it

1930
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,640
right um it kind of seems silly so

1931
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,760
imagine you know you have these

1932
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,360
buildings and they have

1933
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,199
a number of different systems and they

1934
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,800
all converge in one of those you know

1935
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,280
security uh rooms which is where of

1936
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,400
course you take over if you're going to

1937
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,520
take over the building you take over

1938
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,199
that room first

1939
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,800
and they have all these you know

1940
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,560
different systems and one of the reasons

1941
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,760
why they have different systems is

1942
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,800
because they bought them from different

1943
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,520
vendors over many different years

1944
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,199
and they can't get any of their vendors

1945
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,920
to talk to each other regularly

1946
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,120
um so they have all these different

1947
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,560
networks and they all come back and

1948
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,800
essentially there's an application layer

1949
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,320
firewall between all of them which is

1950
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,360
the human

1951
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,239
that pokes things right

1952
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,280
there

1953
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,360
so everything's great um and they have a

1954
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,440
lot of wiring a lot of expenses

1955
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,760
um until uh that part of the network

1956
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,880
goes down

1957
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,679
right

1958
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,480
due to malfeasance fire um or just

1959
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,360
incompetence um and so then you know

1960
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,960
there's a problem and there's false

1961
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,719
alarm issues and other kinds of things

1962
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,040
and yet all equipment is out there and

1963
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,040
the people would like to maybe be told

1964
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,640
if they should go up a floor or down a

1965
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,880
floor or where's the fire or is there a

1966
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,760
fire

1967
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,560
um and it wouldn't be lovely if instead

1968
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,400
you know the devices could talk to each

1969
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,600
other we could have some kind of a

1970
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,080
converged network that would work even

1971
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,719
in the absence of of a brain

1972
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:03,760
right

1973
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,840
and so in that sense it looks very much

1974
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,640
like

1975
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,880
um the home network situation because in

1976
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,120
this case the brain is the isp

1977
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,880
who runs the home router

1978
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,159
and it's the rand's question it's

1979
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,920
because i don't want to use that router

1980
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,760
because it belongs the isp and when they

1981
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,000
replace it i lose all access to all my

1982
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,360
light bulbs

1983
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,880
and that's why i don't want to do that

1984
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,679
but

1985
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,159
so the isp has no brain and they won't

1986
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,840
participate in this network that i want

1987
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
to build and i want to own

1988
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,520
and that's why we need gateway to

1989
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,120
gateway communication and then building

1990
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,560
it's a similar thing it's just that the

1991
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,880
brain's been disconnected because

1992
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
i don't know floor number seven's on

1993
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,120
fire and all the cables and the fiber

1994
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,199
melted right

1995
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,640
and the people above that floor would

1996
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,679
like to know

1997
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,800
what they should do um and what's going

1998
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,520
on and all this stuff

1999
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,600
and so this is the kind of thing that we

2000
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,480
um

2001
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,080
we're having a conversation about

2002
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,199
um

2003
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,199
so

2004
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,120
built a little bit of a diagram of how i

2005
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,040
would build a network in a multi-story

2006
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,640
building and i've had a couple

2007
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,000
conversations with people that do

2008
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,960
building

2009
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,400
automation

2010
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,080
and uh

2011
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,760
it's interesting that a number of people

2012
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,199
when i asked them about the physical

2013
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,880
network things they said well that's a

2014
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,719
really good question i have no idea how

2015
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,880
it's actually physically deployed

2016
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,040
and and i went really that's really

2017
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,320
startling you think that would be a

2018
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,400
critical part of the security posture to

2019
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,400
know what the resilience is and they

2020
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,120
said you know that's a really good point

2021
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,600
why don't i know this question and i

2022
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,120
hope we'll have more information in the

2023
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,560
future this is what i would do right

2024
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,239
i would put a four port router on every

2025
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,159
floor i wouldn't want to wire it all

2026
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,239
back to the to the thing you have

2027
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,239
ethernet you know length limitations

2028
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,400
there's a lot of if you think about a

2029
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,280
you know

2030
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,440
a 40 story building or even this hotel

2031
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,760
is about 23 stories right the distance

2032
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,440
from the top floor to the bottom is way

2033
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,480
beyond uh copper ethernet length so you

2034
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,840
have to go fiber and in some cases it's

2035
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,679
if you once you go up and down all the

2036
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,120
different things it's more than two

2037
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
kilometers and so you wind up having to

2038
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,280
use you know not just multi-mode fiber

2039
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,080
but single mode at greater expense

2040
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,600
so that's silly

2041
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,760
um so you put it together and what do

2042
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,840
you do well you could run a routing

2043
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,760
protocol we have a whole bunch of them

2044
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,199
we actually think ripple actually would

2045
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,520
be really good but i think you could do

2046
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,440
with ospf i think it would be annoying

2047
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,719
because you'd have

2048
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,159
you'd have to think about exactly what

2049
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,000
you're doing with the areas

2050
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,320
i think that if you threw this at a

2051
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,480
typical vendor they would say oh let's

2052
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,040
do an l2 metro ethernet solution put it

2053
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,159
all in one l2 that's the home wi-fi

2054
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,719
network everything's bridged um and then

2055
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,480
they would think okay but now i have all

2056
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,080
this sensor network behind each one

2057
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,560
which is probably

2058
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,400
802.15.4 it might not be thread um it

2059
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,640
might be bacnet as well

2060
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,159
depending what devices in the age of the

2061
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,400
building

2062
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,600
and

2063
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,199
then they would say okay but now i don't

2064
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,800
have ethernet on both sides so i have to

2065
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,000
do routing

2066
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,239
so it suddenly looks exactly like

2067
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,000
the diagrams we just said we have these

2068
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,640
gateways they're connected together

2069
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,800
by a complicated topology

2070
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,239
and they would like to do things

2071
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,760
particularly you would like to have

2072
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,199
sensors on one floor or actuators on one

2073
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,440
floor talk to sensors

2074
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,520
on the adjacent floors

2075
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,400
right

2076
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,719
don't open this door up or down

2077
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,960
stairwells if the one above it or below

2078
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,000
it is full of smoke right that would be

2079
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,320
a bad thing tell people

2080
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
i'm not opening this door because this

2081
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,400
is not a good exit go the other side of

2082
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,239
the building right something like that

2083
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,920
so you know

2084
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,080
something goes bad some floors are on

2085
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,120
fire um what are you gonna do okay so

2086
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,280
there's some differences though between

2087
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,840
the this network and the home network

2088
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
one of them is that there is an operator

2089
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,640
they're just absentee at this time

2090
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,400
so they could set up credentials and

2091
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,920
they could set up configurations and

2092
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,280
they could allocate prefixes

2093
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,480
but

2094
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,440
when the network event happens they

2095
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,760
you can't you can't do anything else

2096
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,679
those machines are not accessible they

2097
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,679
have to have their own intelligence

2098
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,360
and we're not necessarily talking about

2099
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,320
you know

2100
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
ai vision systems that may just be

2101
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,320
stupid things like as i said don't open

2102
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,520
the door if there's smoke on the other

2103
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,560
side

2104
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,440
um

2105
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,199
but you know those things have to run

2106
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,719
that way so it's a little bit

2107
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,400
advantageous versus the home and that

2108
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,520
someone can actually do something

2109
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,159
intelligent beforehand but they can't do

2110
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,840
anything intelligent during

2111
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,600
uh that's really it

2112
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,920
so this is

2113
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,320
neither here there there um it feels

2114
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
like a solution that

2115
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,480
could use the same solution that ted has

2116
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,760
proposed

2117
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,199
on the other hand

2118
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,560
there's a lot of other things that we

2119
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,840
could do

2120
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,679
and i've only really talked about the l3

2121
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,480
part the layer 3 part of it there's a

2122
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,120
layer 4 to layer 9 problem and we're

2123
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,360
having a side meeting tomorrow evening

2124
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,480
and then we're going to walk over to the

2125
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,159
social event

2126
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,159
and come if you want to talk more about

2127
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,679
that thanks

2128
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,199
thanks a lot michael um

2129
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,360
we don't see anybody at the queue so we

2130
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,480
can just like move on to the open mic

2131
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,760
discussions

2132
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,760
so anything that's been presented till

2133
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,960
now is fair game and

2134
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,080
doesn't necessarily have to be

2135
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,520
clarifying questions pretty much

2136
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,080
anything so

2137
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,159
stuart go ahead

2138
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,120
um

2139
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,440
yeah i'm stuart cheshire

2140
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,040
just a quick comment on the thing that's

2141
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,960
been raised a couple of times about

2142
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,640
proxy nd

2143
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,239
um

2144
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,320
certainly that can work

2145
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,480
uh the thing that makes me uneasy about

2146
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,840
that solution

2147
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,120
is

2148
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,640
uh it seems like the very easy solution

2149
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,560
when you just want to add one more thing

2150
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,800
to the network just make the broadcast

2151
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,159
domain bigger and bigger and bigger

2152
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,520
and it's like the

2153
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,760
the silly example people give of boiling

2154
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,400
a frog just you you incrementally add

2155
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,800
things until the thing doesn't scale

2156
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,600
when people talk and the at its heart

2157
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,320
what nate what proxy nd is doing

2158
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,800
is making it look like all these devices

2159
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,880
are on a single ethernet

2160
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,640
and

2161
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,199
that is great for the

2162
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:28,080
ieee um but this is the internet

2163
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,560
engineering task force not the lan

2164
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,600
engineering task force and

2165
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
uh something feels wrong

2166
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,920
if we're rejecting everything about

2167
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,080
internetwork protocols and building

2168
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,280
everything

2169
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,719
using a sort of 1980s land style mindset

2170
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,560
like let's just build the land and one

2171
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,960
of the examples was given like what if

2172
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,960
you have an enormous factory

2173
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,640
if i have an enormous factory having

2174
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,640
that be a single lan seems like a

2175
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,040
terrible idea it's rejecting the whole

2176
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,199
uh

2177
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,920
insights of of having an internetwork

2178
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,239
protocol not just a land protocol thank

2179
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,840
you thanks joy pascal go

2180
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,320
ahead yeah there is a big misconception

2181
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,719
here as to what i i'd love to speak with

2182
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:13,920
you offline

2183
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,320
we don't we explicitly break the

2184
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,400
broadcast domains right the goal of

2185
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
doing in the proxy is to do separate

2186
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,719
broadcast domain and the whole work at

2187
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,800
six low for more than 10 years pretty

2188
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,440
much 15 has to be has been to avoid the

2189
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,640
broadcast

2190
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,440
so

2191
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,040
effectively we've designed the routing

2192
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,239
protocol

2193
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,080
when we need a routing protocol and we

2194
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,920
are doing in the proxy when we need nd

2195
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,960
proxy

2196
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,159
um

2197
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,400
it's a matter of having all the tools in

2198
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,239
your toolbox and finding the tool that

2199
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,560
you want but all the tools

2200
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,480
separate the broadcast domain there is

2201
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,640
never this conception of a single

2202
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,960
broadcast domain the way you i kind of

2203
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,280
understood you presented it this is this

2204
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,960
is this is the thing that we want to

2205
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,360
avoid

2206
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,520
so so on that we agree basically what

2207
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,640
you've seen uh jenna jonathan presenting

2208
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,960
about service discovery is the way we do

2209
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,080
indeed

2210
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,320
as well both service and md everything

2211
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,760
is done that way you we don't have a

2212
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,040
choice we don't have broadcast

2213
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,880
so

2214
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,000
go ahead

2215
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,880
yeah so i'll just speak to pascal's

2216
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,400
point because

2217
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,600
i happen to be here but that wasn't what

2218
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,920
i came up to talk about um

2219
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,520
the uh

2220
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,199
the the problem so if you look at dnssd

2221
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,639
which which is what we're talking about

2222
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,600
here what's nice about dnssd that is not

2223
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,639
true of neighbor discovery is

2224
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,000
that

2225
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,159
proxy neighbor discover i should say is

2226
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,480
that we can replace multicast dns with

2227
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,800
unicast dns we don't really have a way

2228
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,719
to do that with neighbor discovery so

2229
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:47,679
there's always going to be a certain

2230
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:48,960
amount of multicast if we're doing

2231
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,239
neighbor discovery

2232
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,480
and as you add more hosts you get more

2233
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,679
multicast

2234
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:54,560
so

2235
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,760
uh so

2236
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,600
you know it's it's certainly true and i

2237
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,360
i don't think that anybody here is

2238
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,040
criticizing the solution that you've

2239
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,120
generated for the factory floor

2240
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:03,840
but

2241
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,280
uh we were trying to come up with a

2242
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,120
solution that that didn't have the

2243
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,280
scalability issue that you're that that

2244
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,400
i see in your solution at all um and i

2245
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,920
do see that there's a scalability

2246
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,000
solution as as the number of neighbors

2247
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,679
on the network grows there's that's

2248
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,360
clearly a scalability issue whether it's

2249
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,800
a big issue or not

2250
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,480
is a matter we could debate but it's

2251
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,320
definitely an issue um

2252
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,440
so

2253
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,239
so

2254
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,320
the point is that our sort of you know

2255
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,159
in the dns sd working group our path

2256
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,320
forward is is to try to get as much away

2257
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,560
from multicast as possible

2258
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,880
and uh that creates efficiencies that

2259
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,719
you just can't get with with if you're

2260
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,880
doing everything with multicast

2261
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,440
um so that was an answer to pascal's

2262
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,280
point which i you know i think i think

2263
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,199
that that's a good thing to discuss

2264
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,880
but the thing that i actually came up to

2265
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,360
do was relay something from somebody who

2266
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,239
sent me some private email um

2267
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,360
uh from from ero who uh was just asking

2268
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,920
like does the stub network's

2269
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,040
problem

2270
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,880
uh relate to

2271
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,440
uh virtual networks so if you have

2272
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,679
virtualization on a device

2273
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:08,480
uh

2274
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,960
could snack provide a way for

2275
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,800
virtualized devices

2276
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,159
to access uh a a

2277
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,480
a an infrastructure link or or the

2278
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,159
internet and i think the answer to that

2279
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,920
is yes and we should probably

2280
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,239
factor that into our use case discussion

2281
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:28,000
okay perfect thank you thanks

2282
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,320
matthew you got into the line and got

2283
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,840
out is that something you wanted to say

2284
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,080
or

2285
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,679
go ahead matthew

2286
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,760
uh can you hear me

2287
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,320
matthew we cannot hear you

2288
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,360
hello can you hear me

2289
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,159
no yeah you're coming up very low but

2290
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,760
yeah if you can speak up a little bit

2291
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,120
probably

2292
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,159
sure

2293
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,159
uh hi i

2294
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,639
i'm matt richards i'm at uh euro

2295
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,639
subsidiary amazon

2296
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,040
uh i just wanted to just talk a little

2297
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,480
bit about you know euro um

2298
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,239
or amazon through euro has been kind of

2299
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,080
participating in

2300
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,360
uh some of the thread and matter work we

2301
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,400
brought up

2302
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,760
uh thread on our

2303
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,679
hero home wi-fi routers

2304
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,080
and just you know we're very interested

2305
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,960
in kind of seeing where this snack

2306
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,440
snack working group goes um

2307
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,159
i think just this is a

2308
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:35,760
pretty interesting problem that has a

2309
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,159
lot of kind of similarities to the

2310
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,159
you know mesh wi-fi work that we're

2311
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:43,040
doing and just

2312
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,800
very excited to see us not make some of

2313
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,400
the same mistakes

2314
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,320
i guess specifically around large

2315
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,199
multicast domains um

2316
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,560
so um

2317
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,320
just

2318
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,080
hopefully just kind of excited for this

2319
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,400
um

2320
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,159
this problem statement to really get a

2321
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,080
thorough investigation and

2322
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,760
see what comes out of this

2323
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,360
thank you

2324
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,040
thank you yeah just go ahead

2325
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,679
hello sorry richard patterson from sky

2326
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,639
uk

2327
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,800
more for ted question i think

2328
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,880
so all of our cpu routers in general

2329
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,960
these days kind of operate with a very

2330
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,679
clear like distinction between landsat

2331
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,840
and wan side or or trusted versus

2332
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,199
untrusted

2333
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,639
do we see

2334
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,880
snack trying to

2335
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,719
full get these things to fool themselves

2336
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,800
to work out how to get through that sort

2337
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,600
of

2338
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,440
security zoning like pinholing through

2339
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,239
or do we want to see them auto detect

2340
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,639
and it's now no longer land and when

2341
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,400
it's it's trusted and trusted on both

2342
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,480
sides or how do you kind of foresee that

2343
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,120
that's a great question um

2344
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,480
so i mean clearly uh

2345
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,360
you know

2346
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,280
if we if we say that hosts on the on the

2347
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,719
stub network need to have equivalent

2348
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,040
functionality to hosts on the

2349
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,159
uh on the the infrastructure network

2350
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,080
then um

2351
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,560
our expectation would be that the the

2352
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,679
router

2353
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,040
the customer edge router would be

2354
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,000
responsible for doing you know rfc 7084

2355
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,960
style

2356
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,120
uh

2357
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,320
firewalling

2358
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,520
and i think

2359
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,000
that's sort of the the lazy answer to

2360
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,679
your question i think that there's some

2361
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,679
interesting work to do there it's not

2362
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,199
clear that the snack buff is the place

2363
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:28,719
to or the snack whatever working group

2364
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,080
we come up with is the place to do that

2365
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,280
but it's certainly something that we

2366
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,719
could consider putting in the charter i

2367
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:33,679
think

2368
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,040
uh if we if we thought it's worthwhile

2369
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,800
because clearly there are cases where it

2370
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,040
makes sense to isolate things right you

2371
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,719
don't want necessarily to have every

2372
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,080
device be able to talk to every other

2373
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,080
device on your home network because you

2374
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,760
know we've seen examples like with the

2375
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,880
mirai botnet where that was really bad

2376
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,760
um

2377
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,080
and so so being able to to control that

2378
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,600
might be interesting

2379
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,280
whether this is the place to do that i

2380
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,360
don't know

2381
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,080
thank you thanks

2382
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,679
um pascal go ahead

2383
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,320
i just wanted to reply to ted because he

2384
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,400
was talking a lot about multicast and

2385
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,480
large multicast et cetera

2386
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,159
i mean again that's the thing that

2387
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,280
sexler avoids right i mean so

2388
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,760
you need to look at how we did things

2389
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,320
we built networks with tens of thousands

2390
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,280
of nodes on the same 64. we build them

2391
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,760
we deploy them sometimes we have 20 hubs

2392
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,159
in those networks and they work over the

2393
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,560
exact same radios that are not exactly

2394
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,800
the same but very close to the one that

2395
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,199
jonathan has been talking about and we

2396
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,760
combine effectively writing and and and

2397
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,480
and unicast nd because the whole idea is

2398
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,040
on unicast apart from from either arrest

2399
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,719
or ira at the beginning

2400
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,360
so so it's it's you you have to look at

2401
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,840
beyond the nd the way you knew it 20

2402
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,560
years ago that's pretty much my answer i

2403
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,679
mean

2404
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,520
we need to be honest about what six law

2405
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,400
has and six low c slow builds and ripple

2406
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,320
we build those tens of thousands of

2407
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,199
devices networks so we scale don't throw

2408
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,520
scaling at us

2409
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,159
so i i i probably owe you an apology

2410
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,080
pascal um

2411
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,760
i'm i think i might have been focusing

2412
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,040
on a different question than what you're

2413
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,239
focusing on

2414
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,239
and that might be why we're not coming

2415
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,960
to convergence um what i'm talking about

2416
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,239
is multicast on the backbone and so

2417
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,719
uh i'm trying to avoid

2418
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,760
uh

2419
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,159
having ten thousands of devices doing

2420
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,400
neighbor discovery on the backbone

2421
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,639
if you have a mechanism for avoiding

2422
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,159
that by doing those neighbor discoveries

2423
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,920
with with unicast then that addresses

2424
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,320
that problem and certainly the six low

2425
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,600
solution where

2426
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,199
on the six law network you're not doing

2427
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,199
multicast addresses that problem on the

2428
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,760
six low network but uh you know for

2429
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,040
example in the thread use case that

2430
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,400
we're talking about we also don't do

2431
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,600
multicast

2432
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,719
on the on the 802.15.4 network that's

2433
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,880
that's all done with well actually i

2434
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,159
shouldn't say that jonathan might

2435
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,239
correct me on that but but the point is

2436
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:03,360
we're certainly not doing individual nd

2437
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,920
type multicast on the uh on the thread

2438
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,520
network and so

2439
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,800
so that eliminates the problem of of uh

2440
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,880
you know excess multicast

2441
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,560
in that constrain network but the

2442
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,320
concern the re the scalability concern

2443
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,360
that i had

2444
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,520
was more for the um

2445
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,719
for the

2446
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,360
the the adjacent infrastructure link

2447
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,159
where

2448
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,239
uh you know having all of that multicast

2449
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,679
on the adjacent infrastructure link can

2450
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,199
be problematic in a number of ways one

2451
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,040
of them is the amount of multicast

2452
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,159
traffic and the other is just that

2453
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,560
multicast traffic is not reliable if you

2454
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,800
have a wi-fi mesh network it's often the

2455
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,639
case that multicast traffic from one

2456
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,440
access point isn't necessarily 100

2457
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,080
reliably replicated to all access points

2458
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,400
and in that case uh you wind up not

2459
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,400
being able to reach devices and so

2460
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,639
relying on that kind of multicast isn't

2461
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,960
ideal

2462
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,320
can they answer or do do we go to the

2463
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,440
meeting

2464
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,800
you don't want to clog the meeting but

2465
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,639
we have answers for that there basically

2466
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,120
let me know at the end of the meeting if

2467
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,440
i can say exactly what happens but yeah

2468
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,360
i mean i'm i'm i won't hold the

2469
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,440
discussion just that it's not the end of

2470
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,480
the way

2471
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,520
we're beyond

2472
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,360
right like so i i think we're kind of

2473
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,880
staying out of solution space for now

2474
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,239
but i think it's really good to have

2475
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,239
that discussion right but i think as

2476
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,679
long as we agree

2477
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,679
on the goal of reducing multicast on the

2478
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,280
infra network is good enough i think we

2479
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,440
can talk about the solutions after right

2480
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,239
so

2481
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,440
um

2482
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,639
that'll be good like so if you have time

2483
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:33,760
at the end of the meeting we can do that

2484
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,120
or we can do it on the mailing list or

2485
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,960
we can probably do another like interim

2486
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,960
meeting or something just to tackle that

2487
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,400
and so that's certainly fair game

2488
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,600
because we are not presupposing a

2489
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,960
solution here right we are talking about

2490
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,600
the problem space

2491
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,840
thanks uh go ahead

2492
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,520
you basically said what i was about to

2493
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,840
say which is

2494
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,760
um i love the excitement people have to

2495
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,360
try to solve this problem here in the

2496
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,280
room today but that's not actually what

2497
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,199
we're here for we're here to assess if

2498
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,960
there's interest in solving this problem

2499
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,639
yeah thanks and i think like one of the

2500
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,880
things that i think both stewart and ted

2501
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,480
stated it's like hey if there's a better

2502
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,920
solution we want to find it right so

2503
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,400
this is not like just trying to rubber

2504
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,080
stamp a solution or anything like i

2505
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,080
think it's everything is fair game now

2506
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,080
pascal thank you

2507
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,679
philip thanks

2508
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,040
so

2509
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,159
uh as we discussed a little bit about uh

2510
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,920
whether this could also be applicable

2511
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,320
for virtualized infrastructures

2512
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,920
uh another question came up to me is

2513
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,920
do we have to think in this working

2514
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,360
group about

2515
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,000
limitations and scalability based on the

2516
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,080
addressing so in virtualized

2517
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,080
infrastructures you easily come up with

2518
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,679
situations

2519
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,520
where you end up with saying okay is 64

2520
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,040
per link

2521
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,199
you easily run out of the number of

2522
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,679
buckets for networks in the

2523
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,120
infrastructure

2524
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,600
above you easily run out of that

2525
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,520
and the question is do we also for the

2526
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,120
home network case

2527
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,280
come to a place where we for example

2528
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,080
have a prefix delegation from the isp

2529
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,199
with a slash 56 or something like that

2530
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:10,400
and we need more stop networks then that

2531
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,239
fits in this previous delegation and

2532
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:16,759
what the solution spaces for this are

2533
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,840
ted did you want to answer that

2534
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,760
ted lemon um yeah so that's actually a

2535
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,040
question that that um

2536
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,920
uh

2537
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,840
uh jared was talking about

2538
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,440
um a couple probably a month ago when

2539
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,840
the snack stuff first got discussed and

2540
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,719
um

2541
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:35,840
you know one of the things that he

2542
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,280
suggested would be really interesting

2543
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,960
would be to make it possible to get

2544
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,199
multiple prefix delegations from the isp

2545
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,960
so you know there are there are things

2546
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,239
we could talk about there i think that

2547
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,159
there's a risk here of boiling the ocean

2548
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,080
and the first first uh

2549
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,920
first version of this

2550
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,239
process there's you know if we

2551
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,000
uh if we come to a conclusion that we

2552
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,520
actually need to do that work i think

2553
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,760
that we could probably charter it but i

2554
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,040
don't think that we need to start with

2555
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,880
that and i think if we if we start with

2556
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,400
too many

2557
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,400
difficult things then that like it would

2558
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,480
be good just to like actually you know

2559
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,000
we should be careful not to have a

2560
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,760
solution that that

2561
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,080
we know will

2562
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,080
prevent us from doing something like

2563
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,840
that right but um at the same time

2564
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,440
uh you know we

2565
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,199
uh

2566
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:22,960
we shouldn't try to solve every problem

2567
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,199
all at once so i you know

2568
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,960
and and to be fair to ted like ted did

2569
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,360
actually put up like a like getting

2570
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,120
multiple prefixes in the original

2571
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,880
charter that he kind of wrote and we

2572
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,480
kind of scoped it down because the idea

2573
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,400
is to get something that's

2574
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,560
more tightly scoped to start the work on

2575
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,639
and then we can add deliver i think like

2576
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,800
i like if eric approves right we can if

2577
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,400
there's a working group and like we can

2578
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,000
add a deliverable pretty quickly with a

2579
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,400
milestone right but the idea is like get

2580
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,400
something that's off like

2581
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,639
that's useful and tightly scoped right

2582
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,080
that's usually how we start off right

2583
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,080
instead of trying to do everything at

2584
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,719
once so that's certainly something so we

2585
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,040
can actually add text to the charter

2586
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,960
like to say like hey we should be

2587
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,440
thinking of this and if there's interest

2588
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,880
we can actually add a deliverable too

2589
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,000
but that's kind of something we can

2590
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,840
discuss like in the chatter discussion

2591
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,560
itself right yeah so for this is

2592
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,360
explicit question i think uh

2593
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,520
so for the cloud use cases uh i think

2594
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,760
many people thinking about that

2595
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,080
ended up saying okay we

2596
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,800
we sacrificed another holy cow and we

2597
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,800
scoped down the stop networks to

2598
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,520
something smaller than slash 64.

2599
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,560
and so this is also something that might

2600
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,120
be worth thinking of in this context

2601
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,440
because it might be easier than getting

2602
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,679
larger prefix delegations and updating

2603
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,040
the prefix delegation mechanism

2604
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,760
so philippe like i think um we can

2605
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,600
certainly discuss that there is some

2606
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,199
issues with slack on non slash 64s right

2607
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,360
so i i think like you know jen six-man

2608
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,840
chair is sitting here so i i think

2609
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,520
they're probably trading on some very

2610
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,120
dangerous territory if we start

2611
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,480
specifying it but it's certainly

2612
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,920
something we can discuss and probably

2613
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,199
throw off to six man at some point

2614
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:10,400
thank you so

2615
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,040
uh just to be clear what i thought the

2616
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,960
interesting virtualization problem was

2617
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,639
was you have a copy of vmware and you

2618
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:18,320
want your you want your vmware host to

2619
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,199
be able to communicate equally on the on

2620
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,600
the link with other hosts without

2621
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,239
necessarily using bridging um

2622
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,520
not

2623
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,280
solving the whole like cloud

2624
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,280
virtualization problem which is a huge

2625
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,440
problem

2626
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,600
yeah yeah yeah so well you know and and

2627
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,760
that's not to say that we can't

2628
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,280
go in that direction if it makes sense

2629
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,719
but but i think there's a there's a

2630
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,040
there's a very tightly scoped stub

2631
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,119
network use case for

2632
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,840
something like vmware that and you know

2633
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,360
not necessarily vmware but that kind of

2634
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,960
thing that

2635
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,800
is interesting and that might might well

2636
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,480
be in scope

2637
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,280
like right away or soon

2638
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,199
from there

2639
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:25,840
showing up

2640
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,840
it's like

2641
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,800
there you go

2642
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,800
okay so now we are at the interesting

2643
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,560
part of the meeting where like you know

2644
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,840
people are gonna

2645
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,679
try to add things delete things to the

2646
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,000
charter so thanks ted for like getting

2647
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,760
the discussion kicked off

2648
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,920
so we had quite a bit of discussion on

2649
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,360
the mailing list

2650
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,119
and we hope to have more discussion on

2651
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,400
this today uh the idea would be to

2652
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,239
for people to have a general idea of

2653
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,480
what we're trying to solve here

2654
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,000
we don't need to

2655
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,920
like dot the

2656
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,639
eyes and cross the t's but as long as we

2657
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,719
understand what is the general problem

2658
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,560
we are working on and what we are going

2659
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,320
to try to deliver initially i think we

2660
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,679
should be fine

2661
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:08,480
so

2662
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,719
uh does

2663
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,560
has anybody in the room

2664
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,719
uh not read this charter please hum

2665
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,920
okay so we'll just go through this

2666
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,400
slowly

2667
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,280
tell us if you want us to slow down but

2668
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,440
like you know this is the initial text

2669
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,320
of the charter so it doesn't talk about

2670
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,159
any deliverables but it talks about the

2671
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,520
generic scope

2672
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,719
of the work you're trying to do it's

2673
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:35,920
probably going to take like two minutes

2674
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,520
for you to read

2675
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,440
if you cannot read this

2676
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,520
please raise your hand or come up front

2677
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,239
to take a look and it's also uploaded in

2678
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,159
the meeting materials

2679
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,040
into

2680
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,000
a

2681
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,960
item called charter highlighted

2682
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,760
if you're looking at this remotely

2683
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,840
so two minute time please go ahead

2684
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,239
and if you have any questions on the

2685
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,000
first part of the charter which is just

2686
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,560
the background and the description of

2687
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,639
the proposed work

2688
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,960
uh you can join the mic line michael

2689
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,000
you're up first michael richardson so

2690
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,679
um

2691
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,040
the third paragraph um

2692
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,080
so

2693
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,159
hidden inside of this third paragraph

2694
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,000
and i don't know whether we should

2695
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,840
change this or not

2696
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,000
hidden inside of this is essentially the

2697
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,600
statement that if the host can connect

2698
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,679
out that is implying that actually you

2699
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,360
know double that

2700
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,199
is a it would otherwise be a workable

2701
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,960
solution if all we needed to do is have

2702
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,639
the host connect out

2703
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,480
i don't know if we should if we should

2704
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,239
say that more clearly if we really need

2705
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,159
to hit people over the head

2706
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,679
that this is exactly what we're trying

2707
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,360
to avoid

2708
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,400
or

2709
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,600
you know

2710
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,119
um

2711
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,360
whether that's understood by everyone or

2712
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,719
needs to be understood by everyone i

2713
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,800
don't know right i mean i guess the

2714
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,360
question is you know i think the isg

2715
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,480
understands what we're talking about

2716
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,840
when we say that

2717
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,600
without having to say explicitly but

2718
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,920
maybe the rest of the world does not

2719
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,480
okay okay so i just don't know if i'd

2720
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,000
fix it or not because i know what it

2721
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,880
means

2722
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,560
but i don't know if any if other people

2723
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,719
outside this room understand it i think

2724
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,600
it makes sense to clarify it michael but

2725
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,199
i think stuart might have a point on

2726
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:42,880
that and

2727
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,880
i have a question for ted

2728
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,119
do we have a typo there

2729
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,040
in the last sentence is infrastructure

2730
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,280
twice hosts on the infrastructure

2731
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,960
network can't discover hosts on the

2732
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,719
infrastructure network did that mean

2733
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,239
stub network for the second one

2734
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,480
thanks for noticing that uh

2735
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,719
so so we're talking about the sentence

2736
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,560
where it says

2737
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,400
but hosts on the infrastructure network

2738
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,679
uh so

2739
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,600
it cannot be the case that hosts on the

2740
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,000
stub network can connect out

2741
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
but hosts on the infrastructure network

2742
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,080
can't discover connect to hosts on the

2743
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,840
infrast on the stub

2744
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,600
network

2745
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,199
uh

2746
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:24,400
right

2747
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,000
yeah so it should be it should say stub

2748
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,520
network in the second

2749
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,880
that second infrastructure should be

2750
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,560
stubbed are you editing this or do you

2751
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,719
want to i think uh ted if you can join

2752
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,719
from meet echo like the full client and

2753
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,719
yeah you have the editable version of

2754
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,320
this right yeah i mean i think the link

2755
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,560
that i gave you lets you edit too okay

2756
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,639
so but i'm happy to do that yeah do if

2757
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,000
you can do that that'll be good thank

2758
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,840
you uh juan carlos go ahead

2759
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,760
hi can you hear me

2760
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,600
yeah again go ahead okay thanks uh

2761
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,320
i guess uh well i i understand that the

2762
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,520
the this

2763
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,760
covering uh problem and the splitting

2764
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,000
and the dynamics of the network what i'm

2765
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,800
still not sure i i understand and and

2766
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,560
that was probably an answer but i

2767
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,400
couldn't hear well uh from richard's

2768
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,800
question before is whether we want to

2769
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,840
also consider the onboarding part

2770
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,520
or are we just dealing with the network

2771
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,840
when it's already set up and

2772
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,199
and we just want to make sure that it

2773
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,800
works or we are we dealing also with the

2774
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,679
onboarding of new

2775
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:28,719
the devices

2776
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,760
authorization all that

2777
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
ted lemon here um i think that's a

2778
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,320
really interesting problem uh

2779
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,480
but it's also probably specific to the

2780
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,440
individual type of stub network and so

2781
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,639
uh

2782
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,400
you know we could maybe do something

2783
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,239
like that but i don't know that it's

2784
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:51,040
necessarily in scope

2785
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,560
certainly for the thread use case we

2786
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,719
already have a solution for that and so

2787
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,400
we wouldn't need the ietf to solve that

2788
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,400
problem for us but

2789
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,600
there might be a use case where that

2790
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,880
does matter but you know we already have

2791
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,560
onboarding for wi-fi networks you type

2792
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,000
in the password

2793
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,239
so

2794
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,880
guy please thanks

2795
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,520
hi there tom hill uh bt

2796
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,679
um

2797
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,679
having read now through the proposed

2798
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:20,719
charter um and i think in follow-up to

2799
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:23,040
richard's question um previously around

2800
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,880
security

2801
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,639
i think it's incumbent upon us actually

2802
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,560
when we're

2803
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,000
it seems like feature creep i think in

2804
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,440
some cases but i think it's incumbent

2805
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,960
upon us to at least consider basic

2806
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,080
security

2807
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:39,600
um as a remit of this charter of snack

2808
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,239
on the basis that if we don't

2809
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:46,560
consider basic security at the

2810
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,199
uh the borders between stub networks and

2811
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,960
and infrastructure networks for example

2812
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,800
in particular

2813
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,280
on a per sub network basis at the very

2814
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,400
minimum then it will be down to

2815
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,320
each individual vendor to come up with

2816
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,960
what they think that should do

2817
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,840
we're in danger here a little bit

2818
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,239
of noting that we are moving away from

2819
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:11,520
double nat as a as a method but also

2820
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,760
ignoring the fact that we

2821
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,920
today as an industry

2822
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,920
rely quite heavily on the obfuscation of

2823
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,199
double net

2824
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,760
and and and that in general

2825
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,199
we really should

2826
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,600
i think be more prescriptive

2827
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,800
i don't think it has to be super

2828
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,360
complicated simple things such as this

2829
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,760
dub network does not have by default

2830
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,679
access or any stub network does not have

2831
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:35,600
by default access to the internet unless

2832
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,239
you enable that

2833
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:41,280
so i think it's worth

2834
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,560
being more

2835
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,800
being clearer in the charter

2836
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,040
the simple security options for stub

2837
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,119
networks

2838
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,199
are worth considering or at least

2839
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,880
specifying

2840
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,080
okay

2841
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,840
so if i understand you correctly right

2842
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,600
you don't want

2843
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,199
default connectivity from the start

2844
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,719
network to the internet is that like

2845
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,560
something what are you expressing

2846
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,679
because i'm trying to like that's one

2847
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,159
example i think it's the two points here

2848
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,320
are that leaving it undefined

2849
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,800
means that it will potentially not be

2850
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,119
done very well

2851
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,719
um and

2852
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:19,280
it is incumbent upon all of us in

2853
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,719
2022 to think very hard about security

2854
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:25,360
with everything we do

2855
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,040
hence we end up with more

2856
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,880
you know mirai bots

2857
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,960
um or you know the next the next

2858
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,199
horrible great big ddos

2859
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:34,080
um

2860
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,880
exploit that that comes along so i think

2861
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,800
it's very very important that we

2862
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,960
we start with security

2863
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,159
baked in

2864
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,400
at least at a very basic level okay

2865
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,239
thank you um

2866
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,000
ted did you want to skip ahead of eric

2867
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,159
oh yeah he motioned me forward so i'm

2868
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:53,280
i'm obeying um yeah so uh

2869
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,800
the the question that i would have for

2870
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,239
you is do you want the equivalent

2871
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:58,480
control over individual devices that

2872
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,839
connect to the infrastructure network

2873
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,400
i mean that's i see someone over there

2874
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,840
nodding i happen to agree with him

2875
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,920
but but that's that's really that's

2876
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,760
really what you're talking about

2877
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,719
and

2878
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,239
that's why that's where i said you know

2879
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:15,920
that's actually an interesting problem

2880
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,000
that's not a trivial problem

2881
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,040
um

2882
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,320
and uh and it's also probably it

2883
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,520
probably is a different problem

2884
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,199
depending on

2885
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,320
the particular type of network

2886
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,199
so

2887
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,760
yeah yeah of course

2888
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,480
tom hill again um

2889
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,719
perfect is the enemy of good

2890
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,040
and i think if we focus too hard on

2891
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,600
individual devices every single light

2892
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,719
bulb and trying to worry about the

2893
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,800
security of each one

2894
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
we will get too far into the

2895
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,719
minutiae of security

2896
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,760
i think there's there's definitely some

2897
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,199
there is a huge benefit to thinking of

2898
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,360
this in broad swathes so per stub

2899
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,199
network is going to be far more

2900
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:01,119
manageable than per device

2901
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,840
but it's certainly better than no

2902
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,840
security thought at all when we go into

2903
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,840
this so the reason that i'm pushing back

2904
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,199
on this a little bit is because i think

2905
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,639
that your model of what a stub network

2906
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,159
is is incorrect a stub network is

2907
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:16,639
essentially equivalent to a bridge

2908
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,639
um and that doesn't mean that we don't

2909
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,400
want this we don't want to solve this

2910
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,600
problem but

2911
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,560
but

2912
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,159
uh so

2913
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:26,000
the reason that i say i agree with you

2914
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,239
on this is because when we went at apple

2915
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,320
to implement this our first cut at this

2916
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,960
was to say we're not doing that

2917
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,000
so

2918
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
so basically and and by the way we don't

2919
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,520
support dhcp v6 guas and so

2920
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,440
your devices on the stub network cannot

2921
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,040
communicate with the internet at all

2922
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,239
period

2923
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:45,360
however

2924
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,080
that turns out not to be generalizable

2925
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,880
that's interesting for the case of

2926
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,600
of apple because apple's devices are all

2927
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,480
that way right but when we start talking

2928
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,719
about matter or you know some of these

2929
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,880
other ecosystems they're expecting to be

2930
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,360
able to connect to the cloud and so

2931
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,040
so that

2932
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,320
model didn't work and the and so

2933
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,119
what we came up with as a model is

2934
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,360
that the ce router is probably the place

2935
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,800
where this should be done

2936
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,840
not

2937
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,600
the stub router because the stub router

2938
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,199
is basically a dumb device right it's

2939
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:22,000
not managed

2940
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:23,840
sorry yeah

2941
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,239
i am suggesting that

2942
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:27,920
i am certainly suggesting that your your

2943
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,600
ce router is

2944
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,840
the arbiter

2945
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,199
of you know the ultimate arbiter of

2946
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,199
security on your network

2947
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,199
i think if it has a visibility of

2948
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,360
a stub network that it sees as a

2949
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,440
holistic you know the other side of a

2950
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,960
stub router

2951
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,760
um

2952
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,400
it should be able to set at least some

2953
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,320
form of security policy

2954
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,280
general policy for that holistic

2955
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,239
group of devices

2956
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,600
okay irrigating the id for this buff

2957
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,840
i'm just concerned by the time

2958
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,920
uh the paragraph they are describing

2959
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,119
kind of

2960
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,199
the purpose but we don't see what the

2961
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,600
work items are and we need to discuss

2962
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,360
this as well right thanks thank you

2963
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,719
i wanted to ask if it's in scope to talk

2964
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:24,960
about network partition discovery and

2965
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,320
mitigation and that kind of stuff and if

2966
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,199
it is

2967
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,559
what text in here would

2968
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
support

2969
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,440
i think it's certainly worth talking

2970
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,480
about i

2971
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,599
think it's probably we're not going to

2972
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:38,800
be able to do it today but it's

2973
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,000
certainly something we can continue

2974
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,639
discussing on the list okay if you

2975
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:43,840
decide to go forward with the working

2976
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,719
group

2977
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,760
thanks thank you thanks

2978
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,880
okay so now looking at the

2979
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,560
um deliverables so there's uh four

2980
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,400
proposed deliverables

2981
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,599
so um looking at

2982
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:01,520
the first one

2983
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,480
i don't know if you can see the

2984
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,400
highlight so the it's a document

2985
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,480
describing basic set of functionality of

2986
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,239
a stub network router

2987
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,199
that enables mutual discoverability and

2988
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,280
mutual reachability between stub network

2989
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,280
hosts and infrastructure hosts so

2990
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,280
does anybody have questions about what

2991
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,440
this means

2992
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:26,000
okay

2993
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,840
so instead of me reading through i'll

2994
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,520
just like switch to a different set of

2995
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,920
slides to ask

2996
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,760
uh if people understood all these things

2997
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,040
because you have some time to read this

2998
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,519
charter in the beginning

2999
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,320
michael

3000
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,800
i didn't hear any uh clear

3001
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,719
result from that security discussion as

3002
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:56,400
to whether there was a charter

3003
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,119
uh

3004
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,119
statement about security that was being

3005
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:02,800
asked for or was missing or

3006
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,000
so i don't know if i don't know if that

3007
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,840
conversation that conversation didn't

3008
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,040
seem to end with a charter amendment

3009
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,480
i i i think it's that is correct right

3010
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,239
and that's something certainly open for

3011
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,080
discussion right because

3012
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,760
we're not going to solve that here today

3013
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,119
right like we have like 10 minutes left

3014
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:20,320
to go right we're not going to be able

3015
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,520
to solve whether that's going to go in

3016
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,400
the chat or not right but

3017
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,159
uh tom hill from bt again um

3018
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,639
my hope was that the charter could be

3019
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:31,760
security

3020
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,760
aspirations could be clarified in the

3021
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:34,880
charter

3022
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,440
i think they're

3023
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,920
skimmed over at the moment okay sounds

3024
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,320
good thank you um ted can you take a

3025
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,360
note

3026
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,159
to

3027
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,440
add

3028
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,040
a discussion regarding that onto the

3029
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,440
mailing list thank you stuart go ahead i

3030
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,119
would support having the child to say

3031
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,360
that the working group if formed will

3032
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,520
consider security questions i don't know

3033
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,280
whether we need to say that about an itf

3034
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,040
working group but if it's easier to

3035
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,360
clarify that we will consider security

3036
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,480
questions sounds good thank you

3037
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,080
okay so

3038
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,159
uh so there's like um i think like two

3039
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:16,239
issues that kind of have we have to

3040
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,320
resolve so one of them is the security

3041
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,920
related questions and the other one that

3042
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,920
came up is eric's point about network

3043
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,239
partitioning and healing and so on so i

3044
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,639
think um ted if you can kind of make a

3045
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,159
note like i know you're taking notes at

3046
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,239
the end of the charter on the google doc

3047
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,239
but if you can kind of like try to close

3048
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:35,919
the loop on that after the meeting

3049
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,440
security was one of them and eric

3050
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,800
klein's question about network

3051
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,480
partitioning and healing whether that's

3052
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,759
in scope or not so if you can

3053
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,639
sounds good so

3054
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,639
other than that is there any questions

3055
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,320
about the clarity of what's written so

3056
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,080
like you know two things came up that's

3057
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:58,880
not

3058
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,520
like there in in the text right now but

3059
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,520
um do you have any questions about the

3060
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,639
clarity of what's actually in there

3061
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:17,280
uh uh gabe go ahead

3062
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,080
assumption

3063
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,199
um

3064
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:24,159
yes i have a question about clarity i'm

3065
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:26,320
not sure what the difference is between

3066
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:29,199
the second and third deliverable i see

3067
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:32,000
that the third one is more general and

3068
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,480
includes the second one

3069
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,520
um

3070
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,679
so i'm not sure why the second one

3071
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,719
exists unless the point is to

3072
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,719
uh the second one might be a simpler one

3073
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:45,520
to address initially and maybe the third

3074
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,040
one would be dropped if it's more

3075
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,800
general so

3076
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,320
yeah please clarify it was a

3077
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,920
relationship between the second and

3078
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,199
third thanks

3079
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,760
so uh i'll clarify that in the document

3080
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,599
but just to be just to answer your

3081
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,679
question briefly um the difference is

3082
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:03,280
connecting the internet is sort of like

3083
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,000
cloud connectivity connecting to

3084
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,679
adjacent links could mean connecting

3085
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,360
within like a corporate network or

3086
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,360
something like that and the problems are

3087
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,480
slightly different because one of them

3088
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:13,920
involves using a default route and one

3089
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,440
of them possibly involves more

3090
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,199
complicated routing that's basically the

3091
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,678
distinction

3092
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:24,400
includes internet already

3093
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:33,239
ted limit again the global internet

3094
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,639
that clear again

3095
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,000
okay

3096
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,520
thank you

3097
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,679
so um we did talk about scope so there

3098
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,199
is two issues that came up with the

3099
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:50,560
scope so

3100
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,320
we'll try to address it on the mailing

3101
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,840
list after this

3102
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,760
and does anybody think this is like too

3103
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,360
ambitious to solve

3104
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,280
if you have any concerns

3105
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:03,800
hum or come to the mic anything

3106
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,719
is there anybody who feels this is not a

3107
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:10,239
problem with solving you can hum

3108
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,480
okay don't hear anything nothing

3109
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,719
remotely either

3110
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,480
if if you have something please chat

3111
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:28,360
thank you

3112
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,719
okay so now uh eddie if you want to come

3113
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,199
up here like so we can see the response

3114
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:42,719
um

3115
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:45,199
so now we are going through with like a

3116
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:46,960
set of questions which is like typical

3117
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:49,679
for any working group farming buff so

3118
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,599
uh the first question is

3119
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,480
uh who are here or

3120
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,480
if you're online please like raise your

3121
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,199
hand for this

3122
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:01,679
otherwise like who's willing to author

3123
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,239
documents contributor documents and edit

3124
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:05,360
documents

3125
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:07,280
uh in this problem space

3126
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,800
please

3127
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,599
raise your hand

3128
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,679
so the count of the room is about like

3129
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,040
15 people

3130
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,360
um doesn't matter what the number is and

3131
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,480
remotely

3132
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,320
um we have

3133
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,880
one person uh who's like interested in

3134
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,800
doing that so i would say there's like

3135
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,040
fair interest in doing that

3136
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,960
who's willing to review documents you

3137
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,360
can hum

3138
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,760
a few people

3139
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,040
on the

3140
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,599
online as well

3141
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:44,000
is there support to form a working group

3142
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,320
with the proposed charter assuming

3143
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,360
that the clarification questions that

3144
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,840
gabriel asked and two scope questions

3145
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,639
that eric and the gentleman from bt i

3146
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,199
didn't get your name fully brought up

3147
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,520
uh if they are resolved are you opposed

3148
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,280
to forming a working group so are you

3149
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,560
willing to support a working group with

3150
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,480
the charter so that's the question

3151
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,400
pending the edits to the charter so that

3152
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,719
this is not like binding until the edits

3153
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,880
are done on the mailing list and agreed

3154
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,840
upon okay so the question is

3155
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,920
is it support a form of working group

3156
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,599
with this proposed charter with the

3157
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:18,960
pending changes

3158
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,000
if you are

3159
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,520
if the answer is yes please hum

3160
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,520
