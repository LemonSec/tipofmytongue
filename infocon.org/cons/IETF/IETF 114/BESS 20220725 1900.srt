there are so many of them

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
during the 80 changeover obviously i

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,519
inherited some of these things that i'm

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,120
kind of going back on

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
which takes a little bit of time i am

94
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,840
following up on these and hoping to move

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,879
them through

96
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,959

a lot of drafts with him and that's we

109
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
did push quite a lot out um over the

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,000
last year or so

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
okay documents under shepard's review

the redundant multicast source draft uh

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,160
there were some comments i think man

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,520
commander's shepherding that and he

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
provided some comments um and he's gonna

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
do the write-up once all the comments

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
have been discussed and closed

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
um the evpn um multi-homing pa draft um

119
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
stefan has provided a chairs review and

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
we're waiting for a write-up from

121
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
stafford on that

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,080
um

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
draft ietf best evpn geneve is kind of

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,759
moving forward a bit now that we've um

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,720
also been moving forward with the

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
evpn applicability draft in the nvo3

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
working group

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
and that's waiting for write up from me

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
the

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
evpn fast dft recovery draft um again is

131
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
waiting for a

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
shepherd's write-up from me and the

133
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,919
reason for the delay in that is that we

134
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,280
had a very

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,199
it took us a very long time to gather

136
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
all of the ipr responses so

137
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
this is kind of a plea from the chairs

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,479
and everybody's work that's working as

139
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
and volunteering at shepherds please

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
respond to the ipr requests in a timely

141
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
manner because we cannot move the drafts

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
forward until we have

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
heard from you one way or another

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,479
about

145
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
ipr

146
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,840
um

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
evpn unequal load balancing is waiting

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
for write up from stefan

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
um

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
the evpn ipvpn interworking draft so

151
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
there's been some discussion on the list

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
this this is in working group last call

153
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
um and there is uh comments from one of

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
the idr chairs on this and these need to

155
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
be resolved we think um

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
so there's some actions on the um on us

157
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
as the best chairs um and on the authors

158
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,960
and to get together with the ideal

159
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,199
chairs to sort this out

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,000
um

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240

162
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,039
evpn um

163

split horizon draft um the comments that

164
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,039
were on the list appear to have been

165
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
addressed and that we think that's ready

166
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
to move to the next stage now

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
um currently we have one document where

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280

169
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,039
working group last call and i know that

170
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,120
that we had this on the list um to be

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,639
last called as well

173
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
at the last itf i apologize for the

174
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
delay of this we've been deliberately

175
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
holding back a little bit because of the

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
large number of drafts that we had

177
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
already sent

178
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,440
to our ad

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,639
to give them

180
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,560
time to process those

181
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
um i think we're going to start moving

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
forward with some more working group

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
last calls and adoption calls um

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
after this itf so so please look out for

185
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,160
that

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,879
okay i took uh this is a list of the

187
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
non-expired working group documents that

188
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
we have on the data tracker

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
i think at the next itf i'm not going to

190
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
go through all of these um

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
one by one uh just a couple of comments

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
the the multicast controller draft

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
there's been some discussion around how

194
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
this aligns or doesn't with the

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,120
um

196
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,199
with some other drafts in the idr

197
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
working group for tree sid signaling um

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
and we we need to go back and look at

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
that draft

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,000
um

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
the

202
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720
huge bgp dmz draft

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
was recently adopted

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,559
the the multicast flow df election draft

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
that's going to expire soon

206
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
so authors please could you just refresh

207
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,799
the draft to keep it if you want to keep

208
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
it going there i think there may be a

209
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
few other drafts that have expired uh if

210
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
you wish to keep your drafts going

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
moving forward please remember to

212
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
refresh them

213
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
otherwise um your your working group

214
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,399
chairs are getting a bit old and we will

215
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,200
forget about them quite easily

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
um

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
the young models we had an inquiry about

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
what's going on with the young models um

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
generally due to to kind of lack of lack

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
of interest um in these and the amount

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
of other work the working group had

222
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,519
um

223
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
we we've put kind of put these on hold

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,279
um

225
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,640
that decision obviously is is uh you

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
know we can we can review that if we

227
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
have some authors that are interested in

228
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
in driving those forward

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
okay just to onto the working group slot

230
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
presentations now just to know because

231
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,080
this is a hybrid hybrid meeting the

232
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
chairs will mostly be or

233
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,279
displaying the slides um if anything

234
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
goes wrong i think man come on is going

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
to try and pick up

236
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,120
uh in the room

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
any any comments on the

238
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,399
working group status update

239
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
so there are two drops first uh first

240
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
one of the draft per flow df election

241
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
that is going to progress by next ietf

242
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
so we were waiting on ignp proxy to

243
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,399
become rfc because it uses that draft on

244
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
that rfc now

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the second one extended evpn

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
optimized ir so today morning i was

247
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
talking to when and

248
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
this is ready for working group last

249
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,160
call so we'll move it into the queue

250
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
okay thanks man commander if you can add

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,839
it to the list on the on the the wiki

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,640
uh

253
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560
that would that would help us thank you

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
so first presentation i think is from

255
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
jeffrey

256
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,030
i just need to

257
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,120
[Music]

258
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
change my

259
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,920
screen sharing over

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
okay so this presentation this draft is

261
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,920
about uh transports uh

262
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,040
ip payload or udp payload owning in an

263
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
ipvpn

264
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,640
uh the draft started with a pseudowar as

265
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
a pseudo-arrived draft and it's just

266
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,680
recently rehomed

267
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
this is a collaboration between me and

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,480
kiara

269
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,279
next slide please

270
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
i want to start with the use case first

271
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
it's for mobile user plane

272
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
transportation

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,760
for 5g the user or playing or data plane

274
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
is via a gdp

275
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
u tunneling and that tunnel

276
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
is over ipvpn

277
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,279
we refer to it uh

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
as the instrument vpn

279
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
the vpn is used just so that

280
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
a converged transport infrastructure can

281
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
be used for

282
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
both mobile and non-mobile radio

283
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
transportations

284
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,120
i have a picture at this end um

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,240
um added at the bottom um

286
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
we can see the genome b

287
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
on the

288
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
left side and the upf on right side

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,639
those are the

290
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
3gpp and network functions

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,800
they

292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
the gdpu tunnels are between the genome

293
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
b and upf

294
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,839
and that is transported in the n3

295
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,240
vpn and so and we have the pes

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
there to support the vpn

297
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
so what happens is that let's say that

298
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,279
genome b

299
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,720
needs to send a gtbo package for the upf

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
it will put down the gdp header and udp

301
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,399
header and then finally the ip header

302
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
and most likely ipv6 header nowadays

303
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,399
but the package gets to the pe one in

304
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,800
that n3 n3brf

305
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
and then

306
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
to transport it over that

307
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
infrastructure

308
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,279
a label stack

309
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,639
or an under srv6 header is proton so now

310
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
and that's in addition to the original

311
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
ipv6 udp and gdp header

312
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
when it gets to pe 2

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
that additional label stack or srv6

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
header is taking off and you expose the

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,480
original ipv6 udp and gdp header

316
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,040
this what we i call it the mpos

317
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
transport king gdp or srv6 transport in

318
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,600
gdp

319
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,320
next slide please

320
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,240
there is a

321
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
draft in the dmm working group uh

322
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,480
talking about using srv6

323
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
to replace gdp

324
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
so this will cause uh

325
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,920
srv6 replacing gdp not transporting gdp

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,480
that is actually still based on the

327
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
3gpps n2n4 signal the gdp parameters so

328
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,760
that replacement is down under the hood

329
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
as far as 3gpp is concerned everything

330
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,000
is as usual but now under the food

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
a gtb tunnel

332
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
is replaced by srv6

333
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,240
and that sr6 is could be directly

334
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
between the network functions or

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,720
it could be

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
just between the gateways attached

337
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,279
within those network functions

338
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
those network functions still

339
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
do the

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
gdpu tunneling but the gateways in

341
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
between will do the translation

342
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
so

343
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
if you go back to the earlier picture

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,760
those n3pe

345
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
n3vpnps are the natural gateways

346
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
the gdp traffic is reconstructed

347
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,040
uh at the

348
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
end and three weekend piece

349
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,320
you uh

350
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,040
you

351
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
the ipv6

352
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
header udp header and gt header is

353
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,680
replaced with the srv6 header

354
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
this is acceptable to some operators

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
because all these elements are under the

356
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
same control operator control

357
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
so the advantage of this is that with sr

358
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,160
you can do the traffic steering

359
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
and you can do a service function

360
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,440
chaining all those wonderful things and

361
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,880
by the way there is also bandwidth

362
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
savings now you don't have the two

363
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
two ipv6 headers and things like that

364
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
next time

365
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,959
so

366
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
now

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
when when when that happens

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,720
the g information in the gdp header is

369
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
moved into the srv6 header

370
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
and

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
now

372
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,000
if your operator

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,399
wants to do this and you are but your

374
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,360
mpos

375
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
operator

376
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
and then

377
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,440
what could happen here is that instead

378
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
of using srv6

379
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,120
you use a label stack

380
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
and but you

381
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
transport the gdp header and the gtp

382
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
payloads as is you don't you don't need

383
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
the original ip header or the udp header

384
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
anymore

385
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,360
now

386
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
with this you can

387
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
especially if you're doing an sr mpos

388
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,600
you can have all those wonderful uh

389
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
advantages of the sr uh

390
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
traffic steering and the service

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
chaining all those things but now

392
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,800
it comes with even more bandwidth

393
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,480
savings now you you do not need a ipv6

394
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
header at all all you need is a label

395
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
and then label

396
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
will tell the receiving router

397
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
to reconstruct

398
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
the entire iv header

399
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
including the udp header

400
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,639
based on the information associated with

401
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
that label

402
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
next slide

403
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,560
next thing

404
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
uh oh okay i guess i already talked

405
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,480
about this the the

406
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
the inner label in the stack basically

407
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
tells the ingress router to reconstruct

408
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,639
the

409
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,759
packet

410
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
ipacket with the

411
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
information associated with that label

412
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
so that essentially is a pseudo wire

413
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,599
that transports udp payload only

414
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,880
um a

415
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
control

416
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
work will be used to prevent transient

417
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
routers from mistaking the

418
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
payload as ip

419
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
next slide

420
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,039
that's why the the draft was originally

421
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,359
put into the uh as a

422
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
piles working group as a pseudo-wire

423
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
draft but after we start working on the

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
signaling details we realize that

425
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
this can be generalized uh to uh

426
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
uh uh

427
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
transport uh ipvpn traffic

428
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
um

429
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,679
without uh considering that pseudo wires

430
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,720
um

431
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
and so it's it is applicable

432
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,320
as long as the traffic are mostly among

433
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
certain codes in the in the early use

434
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
case it's really among the

435
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,600
5g

436
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
network functions

437
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,080
and

438
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,559
and also it means that

439
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
it needs to the operator needs to accept

440
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
that the traffic the package will be

441
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
reconstructed by the

442
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
transit devices

443
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
if that is not acceptable then our bets

444
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,640
are off

445
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,760
um so i want to point out that

446
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
in in this ip

447
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,559
ipvpn the traffic can be transported

448
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,960
in many ways some traffic

449
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
could be transported the traditional way

450
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,120
with original ip

451
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,080
and the udp header or whatever header

452
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
some traffic will be transported with

453
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
just iv header removed and some will be

454
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
transported with both ip and udp header

455
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,960
removed next thing

456
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
so for bgp

457
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
for signaling

458
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
we would use a new sapphire

459
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
the nri will include will include the

460
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,559
label information

461
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,559
a route distinguisher

462
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
and destination address source address

463
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,960
destination udp port and source udp port

464
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,799
those last three

465
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,799
fields source address dst

466
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,840
destination udp port and source udp for

467
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
those could be wild cards

468
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
so

469
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
those updates will carry the same raw

470
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,679
targets as vp and the regular baking ip

471
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
laws

472
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
then the routes will be identified by

473
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
the egress pe

474
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
let's say the

475
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
and then based on the advertisement the

476
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
egress key would create a forwarding

477
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,559
state

478
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
so that incoming traffic with that

479
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
corresponding label

480
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,320
will be reconstructed with the ip header

481
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,039
and if you advertise the wildcard

482
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,000
or address or wildcard udv port or

483
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
things like that then you have to use

484
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
the

485
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
locally configured source address or the

486
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
source udp port

487
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
and the ingress pe when you receive the

488
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
advertisement it will create forwarding

489
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
state

490
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
to strip the ip header or a udp header

491
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
as well

492
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
from matching traffic and then sends

493
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
a remaining payload with just a

494
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,400
corresponding label

495
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
next side please

496
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
so

497
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,159
um appreciate comments and one one

498
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
question here is just that uh do we want

499
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,280
to consider other ip payload types not

500
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,039
just udp things like that

501
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
erickson

502
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,159
so

503
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
my question is

504
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
you propose it for

505
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
any type of

506
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
their

507
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,559
user plane or only for 5g

508
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,679
indeed

509
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
the use case started with a 5g

510
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,799
but i think i alluded to in one of the

511
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
slides this it will be generalized to

512
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
any use case where

513
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,000
the traffic is mainly among

514
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
certain hosts

515
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,720
and

516
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
when it is acceptable

517
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,840
for the package to be reconstructed by

518
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
transit devices as long as you those two

519
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
conditions are met and

520
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
then it can be used beside beyond 5g

521
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
use cases because

522
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,159
i think that it's reasonable to expect

523
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,200
that

524
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,159
5g services will be

525
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
introduced in a network that already

526
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
runs lte

527
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,440
and uses the same gtp

528
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
so then the question is whether it would

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,760
be

530
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
mix environment

531
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
or you envision that

532
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,720
first lte will transition to this new

533
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,159
tunneling and then 5g will join in

534
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
and then how uh these two can be

535
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
differentiated

536
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
did you say lte or og no lt yeah okay so

537
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
i use the 5g example but lte or even 3gs

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
is that it's basically the same thing

539
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
it's uh you you use in the gtbo tunnel

540
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
among the network functions i use the 5g

541
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,600
terms but lte

542
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,320
will be the same basically any situation

543
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
where

544
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,720
you have ip traffic mainly among a set

545
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,600
of

546
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,799
hosts

547
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,200
and you can it's okay to reconstruct the

548
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
package

549
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
then you can use this um

550
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
but i i agree with you that it's

551
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
technically possible

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
what i wonder is that operational

553
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,120
operator consideration so can we take uh

554
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
some of the question to the list i think

555
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,600
horizon q

556
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,559
yeah um

557
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,360
i saw that you are also using this for

558
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
the global table

559
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
in the draft

560
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
uh i wouldn't like to bring up the issue

561
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
of using raw distinguishes and raw

562
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
targets in the global rolling table here

563
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,120
but uh what is the uh the reason why you

564
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
need a distinguisher and raw targets in

565
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
the global routing table

566
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
um

567
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
so

568
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,159
the in the initial use case uh there is

569
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:20,960
the

570
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
we have the n3 vpn right so this has

571
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,039
been started with the use case in the

572
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,679
vpn and it's natural to use the raw

573
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,600
distinguisher and raw target things like

574
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
that

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
and of course it can be

576
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
extended to the global table as well

577
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
and indeed

578
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
there are some discussions on whether or

579
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
we should use rdo rt for the global

580
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,080
table

581
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,799
but at least in my view

582
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,400
using our rdrt for our

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
for global table

584
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,880
could be argued as a feature instead of

585
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,360
a bug and but i think that's a different

586
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
uh discussion

587
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
but indeed at least if we only focus on

588
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,919
vpn scenario then using rd and rt is

589
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,840
is natural and it's required here it's

590
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
you know basically we're basically doing

591
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
ipvp and it's just that we only

592
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,320
transport

593
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
the payloads

594
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
in with this optimization okay so you

595
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
could use the the safy without uh or

596
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
with a zero raw distinguisher and no

597
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
rough target i guess

598
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,039
yes you could do that yeah thank you

599
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,559
okay so this uh presentation is about an

600
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,880
old draft accuracy even before the

601
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,159
pandemic

602
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
i will not go through the uh content of

603
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
this draft um i mainly want to

604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,039
to refresh that there is this draft um

605
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
we didn't do it was thought before but i

606
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,720
think uh

607
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
we want to to move this forward now

608
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
so i have some

609
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,799
background information to provide

610
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
so uh basically to go to fix or

611
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,279
enhancements uh uh

612
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,760
uh some

613
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,559
mvpn or evpn c multicast route aspects

614
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,039
the c multicast routes in mvpn

615
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
and evpn they basically carry customer

616
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
multicast states for example mvpn type 6

617
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,880
and 7

618
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
and evp type 6.

619
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,320
it it is started as a mvp term but

620
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
generalized to cover evpn s method as

621
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
well

622
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,240
it was initially presented in the itf 96

623
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
i included the the slides and the

624
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
youtube link there

625
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,360
later

626
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,240
um

627
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
it was presented again in iit 104 with

628
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,480
additional content on the mvpm interiors

629
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,159
homing situation

630
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,840
again slides and the youtube links are

631
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,320
there that's right

632
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,840
this is basically a snapshot from the

633
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
table content it talks about

634
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,039
five situations five issues there to be

635
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
uh enhanced or to be fixed

636
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,760
next slide

637
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,679
materials oh

638
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
okay all right so the work has been

639
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
stalled since

640
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
2019

641
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
uh so many the main reason is that the

642
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
issues and the enhancements were a bit

643
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
ahead of the time

644
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
at that time um

645
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
and also we can blame the pandemic i

646
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,360
hope

647
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,240
but

648
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,960
now it's time to move forward

649
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,080
in particular one of the issue there

650
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,960
about interiors propagation of mvpnc

651
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,559
multicast routes

652
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,400
that addresses uh

653
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,159
a main problem

654
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
uh in this new draft from uh from

655
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,559
huawei

656
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,799
we had a long uh email discussion in the

657
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,200
mailing list and i see he has a

658
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,279
uh a presentation at the end of this

659
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,320
session

660
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
unfortunately i need to swi uh run to

661
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
another session so i won't be able to

662
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
comment uh there but um

663
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
there is there has been a discussion on

664
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,080
the mainland for a long long long list

665
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
long discussion if you go through the

666
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,799
next slide i included i think i included

667
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,279
a link here

668
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
so um

669
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
basically i would like to move forward

670
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
with this uh

671
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,559
document

672
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,360
and i'd like to say to put put this into

673
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
that option queue um i don't think we

674
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
need to

675
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
re repres represent this draft here i

676
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
have included links from from before

677
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,399
and uh please review uh

678
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,520
and then join the discussion on um

679
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,799
that is happening between me and the

680
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,000
panhung

681
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,279
on this new draft here

682
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,520
any question okay so i see

683
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,039
one person in queue

684
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,679
yeah please go ahead

685
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
can you hear me

686
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
yes we can

687
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,320
i'm

688
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,279
from

689
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,279
huawei

690
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
uh hi jeffrey uh

691
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,399
i

692
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,000
have a

693
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,520
explanation

694
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
uh as i

695
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,760
explained in the early part of the main

696
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,279
list of my

697
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,640
document

698
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,039
the objective and the solution of my

699
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,640
document

700
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,679
to be present later is different with

701
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,039
uh

702
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,919
what you have talking talking about

703
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,360
talk about

704
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,720
in my document it focus on gaps and

705
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,960
solution of m with him using ipv6 influx

706
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
structure scenario

707
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
so

708
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
i think that that

709
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
is different than

710
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
the

711
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,880
document that you

712
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,679
have mentioned

713
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,360
thank you

714
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,399
um

715
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,840
so

716
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
there are different solutions to that

717
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,360
same problem of propagating

718
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
c multicast routes in the interior

719
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
scenario

720
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,760
it could be either based on the

721
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
raw target constraint mechanism that was

722
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,600
discussed in my

723
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,200
draft or it could be addressed

724
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
using the solution described in in your

725
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
drafts

726
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,919
we had quite some discussion there um

727
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,559
so i guess we need to

728
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,600
convince each other which way is better

729
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
or if we should do both solutions or

730
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,360
whatever

731
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
um so that's why i say that

732
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
if we could you know working crew

733
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,279
members could review

734
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,600
my draft as well and review previous

735
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
presentation then join the discussion

736
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
and see what's the best way to go

737
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,520
forward

738
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,559
thanks jeffrey i think

739
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
if any other question i don't see anyone

740
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
else in queue rest we can take it to the

741
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
list

742
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,039
so next we'll begin

743
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,520
so grant's on next yeah let me switch

744
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,760
over there

745
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
so just a reminder for rest of the

746
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,320
people in room that mask is mandatory

747
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,159
so uh

748
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,480
gun i know you have about 30 slides here

749
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,679
and 10 minutes can you try and uh

750
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,679
heaps of the key slides please and just

751
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
please uh ask me to to move on when

752
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,120
you're ready

753
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
sure what we'll do okay

754
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,159
so um

755
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,840
so this uh

756
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,799
this slide deck uh goes over the ipv6

757
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,080
only pe design as well as the ipv4 led

758
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
design all saffy

759
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,679
there's four there's four drafts in

760
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
total that we're going to go through

761
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,159
we'll stream through them

762
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,880
the first two the ipv6 only p design so

763
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,679
that's

764
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,919
that's the initial uh bcp draft that was

765
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,640
adopted in uh april 21

766
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,399
and then that second draft is an all

767
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,039
sappy so that supports all sappies and

768
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,640
then we have another kind of

769
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,720
corresponding draft which is related to

770
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
v4 so it's an ipv4

771
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,519
only p design and

772
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,480
and that relates to the uh bcp

773
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
proof of concept testing similar to the

774
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,880
uh v6 only p design and then the and

775
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,039
then the subsequent uh the last draft is

776
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,519
an all-safy related to the before only

777
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,559
pizza

778
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,120
next slide

779
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
so this slide i just kind of goes over

780
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,039
the ipv6 only p design just those first

781
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
two drafts that i mentioned in the first

782
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,360
slide

783
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,039
the first draft was adopted in 2021 and

784
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,640
this is the proof of concept testing

785
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
that we're working with uh with cisco

786
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,440
juniper nokia arista and huawei testing

787
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
proof of concept of being able to

788
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,679
do ipv6 only peering and it's really

789
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,960
focused on three saffies uh unicast

790
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,519
safety and then safety 128 and 129 for

791
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,360
vpn mvpn

792
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,039
uh the last

793
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,480
the next

794
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,399
draft the ipv6 only

795
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,440
all safy draft so that focuses on all on

796
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
all saffies and it's really broken up it

797
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,080
um all the uh iana sapphies are really

798
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,720
broken up into three categories it's uh

799
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,799
so where you have control plane data

800
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,600
plane in line so like a pec appearing or

801
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
inner asp to pe peering

802
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
and then the third category is a

803
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,760
controller based peering

804
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,000
but basically all saffies are supported

805
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,159
with that second second

806
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,120
draft

807
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
next slide

808
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,760
so uh as far as updates on the on the

809
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,519
ipv6 only uh pe design now we've we have

810
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,760
we have confirmed that all all vendors

811
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,080
us says both cisco juniper nokia and

812
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,600
arista

813
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,159
and huawei sorry excluding the rest of

814
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,760
cisco junior from nike and huawei

815
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,240
support the there's a vendor pacific

816
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
knob that's required for this and we'll

817
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
kind of get into that in detail a little

818
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,880
bit

819
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
that requires that is required to allow

820
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
uh v4 forwarding

821
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,960
with a um

822
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
with a without a v4 address configured

823
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,679
only on the box so that and we will dig

824
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,519
into that a little bit in detail

825
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,159
uh so with this draft uh as far as

826
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,880
testing goes up so cisco juniper nokia

827
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
we're planning to complete all the proof

828
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,559
of concept testing by the end of the

829
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,320
year we'll have that all documented in

830
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
the uh in that draft

831
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,320
and then

832
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,480
arista and huawei were still pending on

833
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,399
on on getting the uh

834
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,600
the uh eta of completion huawei the

835
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
plans are sometime in 2023 to complete

836
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,039
tesla next slide

837
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
so the ipv4 only p design so it's very

838
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,879
similar similar to the ipv6 only pe

839
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,839
design

840
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,960
where this is just a v of a v4 single v4

841
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,239
pier and now we're carrying the v6 v6 uh

842
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,520
nlri over over a single v4p the first

843
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,280
draft similar to the v6 only p design

844
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,320
is a

845
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,639
focuses on three sappys just the unicast

846
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,760
sappy and then the vpn and mvpn sappy

847
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
and then the v4 only p design all

848
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
staffing focuses on all all sappys and

849
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
with the same three categories of inner

850
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
aspiring

851
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,679
edge pce peering as well as a

852
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,440
controller-based periods

853
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,918
next slide

854
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,839
so with this so at a

855
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,320
list here just scope and benefit so i've

856
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
listed here just the benefits of of the

857
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
ipv6 only p design um and what i've

858
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,760
added in here it's just kind of breaking

859
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,000
up the three categories that so of all

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
the saffies so you've got the pc edge

861
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
peering interac peering and control

862
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,599
appearance it's just kind of focusing on

863
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,119
those three and that's what we'll be

864
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,359
discussing in the next few slides of how

865
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,800
that how that plays

866
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
um and a big gain is really the opex

867
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,880
savings here and that's where i bolted

868
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,040
in red at the bottom on the next slide

869
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
so that's in this next slide the

870
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,839
difference here is this is the v4 only p

871
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,720
design so the same scope and benefits

872
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
the only difference here is uh with the

873
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
with the benefits is you you do have an

874
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
additional possible capex savings that

875
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,400
you now you you don't necessarily have

876
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
to actually migrate your underlay to a

877
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
v6 you could stay on v4 and you're able

878
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,000
to carry your v6 as well as you have

879
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,880
additional resource savings with the v4

880
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,000
only and not having to have a v6 address

881
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,160
and actually the control plane overhead

882
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
with the v6

883
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,479
next slightly

884
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,160
so with with the uh

885
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,720
actual v4 only pd design the the vendor

886
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,400
pacific knob so that really the big

887
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,760
thing i wanted to kind of mention here

888
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,480
so both the v4 only p design and v6 only

889
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,359
design the vendor specific uh

890
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,880
knob it allows for for v4 only p design

891
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,760
allows v6 processing

892
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,599
to work just as you would have normal

893
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,720
dual stack

894
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,119
but without having a v6 address

895
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,200
configured on the interface so basically

896
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,040
the interface acts as a layer 3

897
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
interface normal layer 3 hot processing

898
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,440
everything is actually works exactly the

899
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
same but you just don't have a v6

900
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,880
address and that's where where that knob

901
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,359
comes into play so 100 same

902
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
functionality that you would normally

903
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
have with the layer 3 interface pinging

904
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
and tracing works exactly the same the

905
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
one caveat is you have you require a

906
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
loopback the loopback address interface

907
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
requires a v6 address on there and

908
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,320
that's just for the icmp to work

909
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,400
properly from the pe

910
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,079
um everything else ipx fpfix qos acl any

911
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
interface related command everything

912
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,040
else related to v6 works identically as

913
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,119
it would with a standard dual stack

914
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,560
architecture

915
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,880
with so with the v6 only pe design

916
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,640
everything is exactly the same as far as

917
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
the functionality of basically

918
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,599
providing the same with the vendor

919
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,400
pacific knob for v4 processing without

920
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
v4 address configured on the interface

921
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,200
next slide

922
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,760
so with the v4 only p design uh one one

923
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
thing i wanted to

924
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,280
talk through in this slide is the next

925
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,320
hop encoding standardization so rfc uh

926
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
4798

927
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
i'm sorry

928
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
so next yeah go back one more one more

929
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,920
down

930
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,839
there you go want one more there you go

931
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,359
sorry

932
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,400
one

933
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,560
oh

934
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,720
one more up

935
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,078
one more sorry about that sir

936
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,560
you just i think you have to get just

937
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,799
one up

938
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,839
you just have to go i think you just

939
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
have to get one up i think from there

940
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,520
all right there we go that's it okay so

941
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,119
so here in this slide i just want to

942
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,320
mention that um so with the ipv4 lapd

943
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,800
design so with the rfc 4798 and rfc 4659

944
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
they define a

945
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,599
the next top encoding is a ipv ipv4

946
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,720
mapped ipv6 address uh so with ip with

947
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,880
rfc 5549 and then updated with rfc 8950

948
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
the uh

949
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,599
the next top encoding for ipv4 noi over

950
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
an ipv6 next top

951
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
is not a v4 mapped ipv6 address but it's

952
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,440
a it's a v

953
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
it's a v6 address so 16 or 32 byte for

954
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
uh sapi one two

955
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,839
and four

956
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,280
and then for uh sapi 128 129 it's 24 and

957
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,200
48. so similar so um in the industry the

958
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
implementations have have moved away

959
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,160
from what was defined in rfc 4798 in

960
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,760
4659

961
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
related to the

962
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,240
ipv4 map ipv6 address

963
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,200
uh

964
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,160
using a uh a four byte address for sapi

965
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
one two and four

966
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
it's just a standard ipv4 next stop

967
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,040
address and then as well for safety 128

968
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,800
129 using a uh four byte for

969
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
a uh

970
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
a 12 byte address so four byte ipv4 plus

971
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
the eight byte route distinguisher so

972
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,160
this draft would it would it would

973
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
standardize that in code and to ensure

974
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
interoperability without with a new eye

975
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,640
and a bgp code point allocation for that

976
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
so basically providing the same as what

977
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,240
was done with 5549 updated with 89.50

978
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,760
providing that same with uh with this

979
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,720
draft next slide

980
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,640
all right so here we're just going to

981
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
breeze through it and we have a handful

982
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,280
of slides we're going to go through but

983
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,119
i'll just kind of peck through this real

984
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,040
fast so what here what i've done is i

985
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,520
i've listed all the saffies and they're

986
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,440
just categorized basically what i've

987
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
highlighted cpdp that's where you have

988
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
inline control plane data plane so

989
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,880
that's basically the three categories

990
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,599
are

991
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,880
uh pec peering nras peering which falls

992
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
in the cpdp category where they're in

993
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,200
line and then a controller-based period

994
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
where it's cp only

995
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,839
next slide

996
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,800
and then the next two slides i just kind

997
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
of list all in color coded basically

998
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,599
just showing that all the uh

999
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,839
were supported providing the same thing

1000
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,839
where you're you have either an ipv4

1001
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,720
only p design or v6 only for the v4 only

1002
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
you just have a v4 address configured on

1003
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,280
the interface and you can support all

1004
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,000
all the sappys in those three categories

1005
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
and then say same as well with the v6 on

1006
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,040
the side

1007
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
next slide

1008
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
we can skip through this one go to the

1009
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
next one

1010
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
all right so this this slides just

1011
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,119
showing a uh just basically two uh

1012
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,119
this is unicast safety just two separate

1013
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,720
pier so you got a typical dual stack

1014
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,439
appearing next line

1015
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
so here we're actually just now we just

1016
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,839
have a single pier i'm in her ass just

1017
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,040
just uh showing uh this could be pec or

1018
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,560
enter a aspiring where you have a single

1019
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,760
v6 transport pier carrying a unicas safy

1020
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,240
next slide

1021
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,720
this is another example so this is

1022
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,440
showing just sapphy 128 129 two separate

1023
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,839
peers typical dual stack just giving a

1024
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,280
visual depiction

1025
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,079
and the next slide

1026
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
and then here we're just a single pier

1027
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,960
now and just now we've got sapi 120 and

1028
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,400
129 both v4 and v64 so the same dual

1029
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,079
stack functionality everything works

1030
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,560
exactly the same but now now you're able

1031
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,280
to really eliminate all of your v4

1032
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
peering off of the uh off the interface

1033
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,720
next slide

1034
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,319
here's another example so this is

1035
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,960
showing just the mcas tree safy um which

1036
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,640
i think we talked about in i think in a

1037
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
previous uh draft earlier us and then

1038
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
srte so here we have two two separate

1039
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,480
piers uh go to the next slide

1040
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
and now we have one pier basically a

1041
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
single v6 pier carrying both all three

1042
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,079
so you've got safety 128 mcas tree and

1043
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,839
then

1044
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,599
srte i'm just showing the benefits of

1045
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,440
how the single peer now you're really

1046
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
able to eliminate all that control

1047
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,280
playing having a single pier and then as

1048
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,640
well and they've still got that same

1049
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,480
dual stack functionality next slide

1050
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,160
then this one's a controller based

1051
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,480
version so this is that cp only where

1052
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,800
you have let's say bgpls your northbound

1053
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,599
interface and then you have um

1054
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,200
rpd which is a route policy distribution

1055
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,119
up so in this in this case you have two

1056
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,119
separate peers will stacked

1057
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,920
up next slide

1058
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,359
and now you have a single peer so now

1059
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,440
you've got that same controller control

1060
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,920
base scenario controller-based scenario

1061
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,640
in appearing to a pc or sdn controller

1062
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,440
or bgp controller bgpls for your

1063
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,520
northbound and then your

1064
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,160
ipv4 rpd staff

1065
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
next slide

1066
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,960
this next set of slides and i'm just

1067
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,400
going to work through these but this is

1068
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
basically doing the exact same thing but

1069
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,040
it's with the v4 only design and it

1070
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,079
shows up the unicast sappy so what i'm

1071
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,359
going to do is i'm going to skip through

1072
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,520
to the very end and then just ask any

1073
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,680
questions but the next set of slides are

1074
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,079
the exact same functionality and the

1075
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,160
exact same slide deck but it's really

1076
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
just showing the um

1077
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
it's showing the uh functionality where

1078
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,240
we're actually doing a dual stack and

1079
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,359
then we're

1080
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,119
showing the single pier so we can just

1081
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,640
roll through these so

1082
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,240
showing the exact same but now we're

1083
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
just uh

1084
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
having a single pier with uh with v4

1085
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,479
only

1086
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
thank you any questions or comments uh

1087
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,760
or anything related to the four drafts

1088
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,319
that i mentioned

1089
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,359
um i think in the old southeast drafts

1090
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,599
uh i think you're listing some

1091
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,839
uh half esophage combinations that are

1092
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,720
actually illegal uh for instance the

1093
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,800
safety 65 and 70. so vpls and evpn

1094
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,480
you're listing atheists one and two

1095
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,200
which are not defined with those saffies

1096
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,720
so those saffies uh go without es25

1097
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,920
always

1098
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
as far as i know

1099
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,880
thank you

1100
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,319
thank you i'll correct that thank you

1101
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,960
okay thank you

1102
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
uh anyone else i don't see anyone in

1103
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,760
queue thanks again

1104
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,040
okay

1105
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,960
all right thank you

1106
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,280
does anyone else have any questions

1107
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,640
okay

1108
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,400
thank you all right

1109
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,880
so next is

1110
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,720
[Music]

1111
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
am i audible

1112
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,480
yes

1113
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
sure okay

1114
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,839
oh yeah so i have uh three drafts two so

1115
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,520
there are two new ones and two which

1116
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,040
were presented in

1117
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,319
itf

1118
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,160
113 the last one

1119
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
so attended to a few comments but these

1120
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,480
are the two ones

1121
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,079
which were

1122
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,359
written in between 13 and 14 so

1123
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,520
um yeah next site please i'll i'll just

1124
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,000
go over the uh the next one i mean it's

1125
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,800
okay to skip this one yeah

1126
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,640
yeah so the background of this uh

1127
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
extension of the lsp ping the evp and

1128
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,720
lsp

1129
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,839
is all about the comments which are the

1130
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,920
queries which i had for the

1131
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,560
the base draft for the evpn i i believe

1132
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,720
this is not it's a working group draft

1133
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,119
so i mentioned the old

1134
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,680
name here just uh bear with me on that

1135
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,079
so there were a few queries which i uh

1136
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,240
believe were sort of once unanswered

1137
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,319
with respect to the current

1138
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,599
evpn uh lsp being draft

1139
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,319
so as part of that

1140
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,280
so there were two options one to

1141
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,520
include these extension as part of the

1142
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,839
initial drought but the consensus or the

1143
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,960
advice

1144
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,359
coming from the authors was to

1145
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,920
um it was too late in the cycle for that

1146
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,359
draft so

1147
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,160
to

1148
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,720
uh pen down a new one so that's the

1149
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
background of how this came to the four

1150
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,359
four next next one please

1151
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,040
yeah so uh the queries

1152
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,640
were all about

1153
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,760
three unique requirements here

1154
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
so from um

1155
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,160
so the background here is was was to

1156
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,560
draw parallels with the management

1157
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,960
interface when we are accessing the

1158
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,880
networking devices

1159
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,920
essentially it was about the evp and nri

1160
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,319
so from the operator point of view

1161
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,880
just as in a management interface a

1162
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,720
partial index

1163
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,119
can help fetching let's say a bunch of

1164
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,160
entries

1165
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,359
so

1166
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,520
essentially from the om site from the

1167
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,200
ping side also

1168
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,960
it would be easy

1169
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,680
for

1170
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,280
a remote oem access or the om ping

1171
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,160
to be performed with a partial knowledge

1172
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,440
of the key

1173
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,000
essentially within let's say if

1174
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,240
the operator

1175
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,160
knows about

1176
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,359
a prefix which is let's say

1177
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,000
are coming from one source

1178
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and there are no dual sources known per

1179
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,880
se

1180
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,839
so in that case all other attributes as

1181
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,559
part of the another evp and lri can be

1182
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,880
forgotten and just the prefix

1183
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
or let's say a prefix or a mac

1184
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,880
and associated uh

1185
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,119
parameters not no i mean the major ones

1186
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,960
or the significant ones

1187
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,240
can do

1188
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,960
essentially so that's that is the ease

1189
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,440
of usage that is point number one

1190
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,359
second thing which

1191
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,160
uh do the attention was

1192
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,920
uh since om is all about validating both

1193
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,480
control plane and data plane

1194
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,400
performing the validations for both ends

1195
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,319
so essentially um

1196
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,240
the requirement is that in few of the

1197
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,480
scenarios where let's say

1198
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
the routing protocol is in a churn or

1199
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
there is a convergence which is

1200
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,480
happening in place

1201
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,760
in that case if the om

1202
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,400
application is not impacted then the

1203
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,920
best bet is to just do a dp validation

1204
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,480
to ensure the data plane validation just

1205
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,440
to ensure the traffic flow won't be

1206
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,359
impacted per se

1207
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,319
and

1208
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,119
conversely um

1209
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,359
the validation just for

1210
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,760
let's say the the protocol rip pyramid

1211
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,680
against the protocol rib

1212
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,640
uh

1213
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,520
uh information can also help wherein

1214
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,079
let's say there is

1215
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,160
there's a possibility that the access to

1216
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,960
the management interface is denied

1217
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,680
for few entities but as a as a network

1218
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,800
operator as a or as an administrator

1219
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,119
you need uh so this is one more revenue

1220
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,280
to get fetch to fetch that information

1221
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,000
via om to get all the

1222
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,599
uh om specific uh to get all the control

1223
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,200
plane specific uh entries for specific

1224
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,680
for prefixes let's say which

1225
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,640
may not have made it to the actual

1226
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,160
forwarding database or to the data plane

1227
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,599
right so that that's the validation type

1228
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,359
check which which

1229
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,920
was suggested to be introduced third one

1230
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,200
is

1231
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,359
the reachability check to the layers and

1232
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,880
vrfs

1233
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,839
as in

1234
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,400
we all have come across the vrs which

1235
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,160
don't have any

1236
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,280
interface interfaces configured on them

1237
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,440
or no subnets

1238
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,000
which belong to or sourced

1239
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,319
via them there they are

1240
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,440
sort of a liaison vrf wherein uh the

1241
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,359
routes are leaked into and the routes

1242
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,240
are

1243
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,839
moved out let's say

1244
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,119
uh the fabric is uh

1245
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,040
the outside fabric is

1246
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,400
evpn

1247
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
and probably inside it's mpls or vice

1248
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,640
versa i mean mpls l3 vpn so in that case

1249
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,160
it would be good to have a tighter

1250
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,880
control to have this layers in vrf

1251
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,119
wherein if the liaison virus is not

1252
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,359
having any leaked routes and let's say

1253
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,160
there is no evpn tunnel found because of

1254
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,680
the same reason

1255
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,000
for that for let's say the evi

1256
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,640
corresponding to that vrf per se

1257
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,760
then in that case it would be good

1258
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,640
to um do a health check

1259
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,359
via om why by explicitly mentioning that

1260
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,130
in the ompdu rather than

1261
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,280
[Music]

1262
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,760
the corresponding network identifier

1263
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,040
which may

1264
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,520
map to an evi being encapsulated because

1265
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,079
in that case the om check will be

1266
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,839
dropped

1267
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,558
next slide please

1268
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,200
yeah this is just one way of showing

1269
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,079
the

1270
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,440
overlapping of the parameters and

1271
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,119
left side is control plane and right

1272
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,720
side is data plane we can skip this here

1273
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,559
next one please

1274
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,319
yeah so this is what i was mentioning

1275
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,640
with respect to the layers in vrf so we

1276
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,559
have a border router here

1277
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,839
in the vxlan fabric and then you have an

1278
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,119
mpls

1279
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,200
l3 vpn uh

1280
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,880
inter fabric uh

1281
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,599
extension for l3 extension for that

1282
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,359
matter let's say there is no

1283
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,160
uh evp and dci which is being done here

1284
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,440
or no on

1285
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,559
the inter

1286
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,200
in inter fabric uh

1287
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,920
can be mpls or vx and so for for for the

1288
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,880
wide

1289
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,200
uh prevalent deployment i have shown

1290
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,240
mpls l3 vpn here so right at the border

1291
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,160
router is where the location of the

1292
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,200
layers and vrf will belong to as per

1293
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,480
this example

1294
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
and this is where we

1295
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,000
would need

1296
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,440
uh

1297
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,880
om

1298
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,680
check support for that particular

1299
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,200
vrf yeah

1300
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,680
next please

1301
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,319
so to uh solve this uh there are three

1302
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,960
tlvs or

1303
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,559
subtitle which is proposed

1304
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
um first one is the wildcard

1305
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,200
tlv which will carry a

1306
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,319
bunch of

1307
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,680
a bit map

1308
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,160
which will map to which should map to

1309
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,760
the list of sub tlvs carried in the om

1310
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,599
om pdu

1311
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,480
uh the mpls evpn ping pdu

1312
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,200
to

1313
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,000
uh to indicate that those fields or

1314
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,599
those tlbs

1315
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,480
um are sort of wild card or don't care

1316
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
when when the validation has to happen

1317
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,359
at the

1318
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,079
at the other end at the target end

1319
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,000
and the

1320
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,480
uh in line with that or

1321
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,480
typically wild card and validation tlp

1322
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,640
may go hand in hand per se so the

1323
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,440
validation tlv is all about

1324
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,920
uh picking up the mode what exactly you

1325
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,119
want to

1326
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,000
validate here both means the legacy both

1327
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,839
control plane data plane which will be

1328
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,359
the default value

1329
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,760
and essentially the last one the evis

1330
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,720
sub tlv is about carrying the

1331
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,920
evi or the corresponding

1332
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,280
fabric

1333
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,119
mapping of the evi

1334
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,440
in the om pdu next one please

1335
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,000
so this is a little description of the

1336
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,960
wildcard tlv and

1337
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
let's not go with the type probably if

1338
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,240
things

1339
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
expand more i mean maybe these are long

1340
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,760
wrong descriptions of the type field but

1341
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,680
what essentially the sub tlv type

1342
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,200
indicates is

1343
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,559
the

1344
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,960
the value i mean of

1345
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,359
the corresponding subtle

1346
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,960
for which

1347
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,119
we can actually uh

1348
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,000
uh

1349
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,720
uh extend uh this uh

1350
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,599
uh

1351
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,240
i mean i mean map this particular

1352
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,280
uh

1353
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,799
uh uh

1354
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,520
this this this new wildcard dlv

1355
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,000
but the the

1356
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,319
the most important part is the bitmap we

1357
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,880
need to come up with a bitmap per se

1358
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,920
wherein

1359
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,200
the

1360
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,400
each of the

1361
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,640
bits in this 32

1362
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,400
bit

1363
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,359
field will map to or should map to one

1364
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,960
of the

1365
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,760
subtleties which which are which get

1366
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,319
carried in the oem pdu

1367
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,200
so

1368
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,520
and the send side and the receive side

1369
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,119
are essentially the same thing which i

1370
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
have already explained

1371
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,559
so we can hop on to the next one

1372
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,400
validation tlb is

1373
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,119
again an easy one here as i explained

1374
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,760
what kind of validation you want to do

1375
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,520
with the

1376
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,920
parameters or the tlb values which we

1377
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,000
are carrying in the

1378
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,440
um the

1379
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,599
evp and lsp ping

1380
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,400
so

1381
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,839
um yeah

1382
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,440
zero one two zero is the default and one

1383
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,079
is control plane only two is data plane

1384
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,119
only

1385
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,559
yep

1386
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,119
and next one please

1387
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,160
can you move on a little bit more

1388
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,760
quickly please i think

1389
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,119
sure sure yeah

1390
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,839
yeah okay

1391
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,119
uh

1392
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,680
i think i think um this is also i have

1393
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,520
explained this uh

1394
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,319
so this is an explicit identifier for

1395
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,799
the evi or the corresponding fabric

1396
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,760
identifier for the evi to be carried in

1397
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,920
this which will map to

1398
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,799
the

1399
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,040
let's say to the vni or map to the vrf

1400
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,960
on the target so target system which is

1401
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,119
elias and we are fpm

1402
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,520
and next one please i think we are done

1403
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,480
here so

1404
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,599
uh

1405
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,240
the requesting action more uh

1406
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,079
traction i have been sending reminders

1407
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,440
on this since

1408
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,799
this spawned off from an existing

1409
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,799
draft so

1410
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,720
there was a

1411
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,559
again i mean whether we can merge this

1412
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,400
to the original draft or whether we

1413
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,799
should carry on discussing this yeah

1414
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,559
this is the

1415
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,640
further actions requested

1416
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,640
yeah this is it for this one any

1417
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,200
questions yes i see petra

1418
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,480
so petrus you can go ahead

1419
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
hey hi can you hear me

1420
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,160
yeah yes i can

1421
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,599
from cisco system

1422
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,480
uh

1423
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,400
samia a couple of things for you first

1424
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,000
of all um

1425
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,400
i went through the draft and there was a

1426
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,839
comment like there were two comments

1427
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:22,960
about the problem statement which i'm

1428
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,799
not sure if the problem is clearly

1429
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,880
mentioned to be honest uh one of them

1430
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,200
was the nlr key is to complex to

1431
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,319
remember on the actual draft from barack

1432
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,520
jane

1433
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,599
that one i don't understand really that

1434
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,960
prompt statement

1435
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,400
and the second one you were mentioning

1436
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,040
that is no iep address available on dci

1437
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,160
so therefore we need to find out

1438
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,240
different ways that one neither i don't

1439
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,680
understand so

1440
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,960
can i

1441
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,799
can i suggest that you

1442
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,480
that you

1443
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,240
make sure the problem statement is very

1444
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,720
very clear stated you put a bunch of

1445
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,359
requirement on something that i presume

1446
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,440
i anyway i think the

1447
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,559
problem itself is not that clear

1448
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,480
so that's number one number two

1449
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,599
the number the the usage of tlv i'm not

1450
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,200
sure if you need that you're talking

1451
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,599
about bitmap yes so to me it's it's just

1452
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,599
a little information with a very complex

1453
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,520
structure with the tlb not sure if you

1454
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,480
need that

1455
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,920
but before in a way you go to the

1456
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,200
solution

1457
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,599
i strongly suggest that you restate very

1458
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,880
clearly that promising money

1459
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,799
sure patrice uh i hope you have gone

1460
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,960
through the draft in case the

1461
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,359
the slides are not so clear yeah

1462
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,079
you know i i read it but i just perhaps

1463
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,720
it's only me but i'm not getting all all

1464
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,480
the problem statement there to be honest

1465
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,359
okay

1466
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,920
okay thank you

1467
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,240
hi uh samia um

1468
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,000
yeah my first comment is similar to

1469
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,880
patrice's um yeah i didn't understand

1470
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,760
the

1471
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,960
justification about the leaking into a

1472
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,559
vrf

1473
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,760
for the uh the avi tlv

1474
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,359
uh so yeah i i agree with patrice uh the

1475
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,119
second comment that i wanted to make is

1476
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,079
the for the wildcard tlv

1477
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:10,340
um

1478
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,680
[Music]

1479
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,680
basically the draft allows you to

1480
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,960
wildcard any any field of the existing

1481
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,400
sub tlvs if i understood correctly

1482
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,000
but i guess you need to put some

1483
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
limitations in the sense that

1484
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,119
uh if you want to paint uh a mac ip

1485
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,680
route in the egress pe

1486
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,240
at least you you need to specify the the

1487
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,760
mac address right

1488
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,480
so it is not that you you can welcome

1489
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,119
any any field right so i guess there

1490
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,960
absolutely

1491
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,280
okay so i think those details must be

1492
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,559
specified

1493
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,640
and my last comment is that if you look

1494
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,559
at the ayanna section

1495
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,720
you are not requesting for any code

1496
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,480
point or anything and you are saying in

1497
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,440
the uh tlvs and sub tlds

1498
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,920
that could actually be proprietary and

1499
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,559
then also i didn't understand if you are

1500
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,799
writing a draft in my mind it's because

1501
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,960
you are requesting something standard

1502
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,799
right so

1503
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,319
i didn't understand that part either

1504
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,880
sure george the inner one i clarified i

1505
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,319
got the notification from the

1506
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,280
hana team there and yes i'm going to

1507
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,480
clean it up

1508
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,520
yeah okay

1509
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,680
thank you

1510
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,520
so somewhere we may have to go little

1511
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,599
faster for the next drafts because we

1512
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,480
are running around 10-15 minutes late

1513
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,160
oh okay sure i'll just try to finish off

1514
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,040
because the last two we don't need to

1515
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,640
because it's just an update from the

1516
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,240
last presentation next one

1517
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,400
um

1518
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,240
so matthew we don't see your screen

1519
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,520
anymore you are there

1520
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,319
that is offline i think

1521
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,389
[Music]

1522
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,060
oh matthews

1523
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,150
[Music]

1524
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,960
let's give a second i think he may be

1525
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,599
rejoining

1526
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,860
[Music]

1527
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,720
okay his system crashed so let me see

1528
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,480
how can i present from here

1529
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,319
can i share or

1530
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,839
yeah you can say if you have the slide

1531
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,359
please sir

1532
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,680
sure

1533
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,240
um i have

1534
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,000
requested actually somebody needs to

1535
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,400
give me the permission

1536
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,489
[Music]

1537
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,399
from here

1538
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,559
so

1539
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,440
you can do it from there you have to be

1540
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,319
on your own

1541
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,599
i have logon

1542
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,790
permission

1543
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,820
[Music]

1544
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,399
okay it is

1545
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,400
yes

1546
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,240
yeah i'm not able to accept his

1547
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,959
presentation

1548
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,039
looks like some admin role

1549
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,640
okay

1550
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,039
just give us few seconds

1551
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,039
sure

1552
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,839
so matthew is trying to

1553
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,480
login back

1554
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,720
it looks like even he's not able to log

1555
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,799
in

1556
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,240
so um

1557
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
if you can go ahead with somebody in

1558
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,240
room present presenter then um

1559
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,558
no i'm not able to see

1560
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,960
textured

1561
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,960
you

1562
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,940
is

1563
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,019
[Music]

1564
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,280
is the ethernet can you connect this tv

1565
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,940
faster

1566
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,030
[Music]

1567
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,440
okay

1568
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,440
accept

1569
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,680
because for the permission

1570
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,359
it is for mine

1571
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:45,119
so let it do the test complete

1572
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,839
and now you can go to presentations and

1573
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,000
sorry so matthew are you able to

1574
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,319
present

1575
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,200
again i'm back here

1576
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,640
i'm gonna try this way just give me a

1577
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,520
minute

1578
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,240
it's saying that all

1579
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,160
slots for the requested media already

1580
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,520
taken so i don't know what's going on

1581
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,319
um

1582
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,640
so i got a request shall i

1583
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,720
go ahead and say yes start sharing or

1584
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,839
what should i do now

1585
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,160
okay

1586
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,399
okay

1587
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,000
are you able to

1588
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,799
view the

1589
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,680
are you able to

1590
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,280
yeah we can see and you can go to

1591
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,760
presentation mode maybe

1592
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,839
i'm sure yeah i'm doing that

1593
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,680
okay um

1594
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,039
is it are you able to see this

1595
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,680
yes we can yeah so

1596
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,839
um this is about

1597
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,000
um i'm marrying two pieces of the

1598
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,359
technology here it's all about the ip

1599
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,559
bindings uh with respect to the network

1600
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,240
deployments where

1601
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,440
the

1602
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,680
as in the legacy there would be a

1603
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,599
significant uh

1604
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,480
approval required to let the clients in

1605
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,240
i mean from the

1606
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,319
uh

1607
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,960
in in the network per se right so from

1608
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,720
that on uh so the so the l3 clients can

1609
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,880
also be looked into via various

1610
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,839
mechanisms dhcp nd

1611
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,480
and thus and the snooping part of it uh

1612
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,119
so um

1613
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,400
but uh

1614
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,960
the the but these procedures are very

1615
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,599
local to the access side of the network

1616
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,319
wherein it's between the access switch

1617
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,839
hosting the

1618
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,440
uh these ip bindings and requesting for

1619
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,319
the approval for letting the uh the

1620
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:57,280
client

1621
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,920
client packet in with with a specific

1622
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,160
credential which can be mac addresses

1623
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,119
but

1624
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,480
in case the network is shared is is

1625
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,359
extended across the sites or let's say

1626
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,799
there is a potential of

1627
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,880
a client moving

1628
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,399
between the

1629
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,560
between the access switches on the

1630
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,640
wireless controllers per se

1631
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,120
then there is a need to synchronize

1632
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,759
this approval which has been granted at

1633
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,880
one

1634
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,399
access switch

1635
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,799
to be to be synchronized to all others

1636
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,799
whether within the fabric or outside the

1637
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,319
fabric so bgp control at the helm of it

1638
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,479
if in case we have uh

1639
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,238
uh three vxlan or evpn provision sites

1640
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,000
and

1641
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,279
in this case

1642
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,080
you have i'm just coined them as vteps

1643
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,399
and you have host two host one on one of

1644
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,198
them and these vlans are extended across

1645
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,719
the sides per se so anything learned via

1646
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,439
snoop which is moved up on the access

1647
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,640
side of let's say we tap one

1648
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,520
one two or let's say uh we have one one

1649
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,960
i think

1650
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,080
something

1651
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,399
not so right in this diagram

1652
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,399
will not be synchronized with each other

1653
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,000
and these subnets are are are stretched

1654
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,839
beyond the fabrics per se and there is a

1655
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,120
requirement to synchronize this

1656
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,000
approval of clients client

1657
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,920
being allowed in the network or the

1658
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,000
extended network that needs to be

1659
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,319
synchronized

1660
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:35,198
essentially dscp packets uh

1661
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,880
wouldn't be leaked into the fabric

1662
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,560
essentially or should not be leaking to

1663
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,198
the fabric more so we shouldn't be

1664
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,560
allowing the

1665
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,158
nd and the r

1666
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:47,520
to be leaked over the van pipe per se

1667
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,640
so

1668
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,679
these are the three ones so

1669
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,439
is local to the client as i explained in

1670
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,960
data packets

1671
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,239
which are the dhcp packets or let's say

1672
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,520
the relays or the rpendees essentially

1673
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,840
should be avoided and should not eat up

1674
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,120
into the

1675
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,040
van pipe

1676
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,840
um

1677
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,840
the solution is to uh synchronized uh

1678
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,560
leverage the route type to the android

1679
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,600
mac

1680
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,960
advertisement

1681
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,520
by tying it to a new extended community

1682
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,000
which indicates that there is a security

1683
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,600
approval for

1684
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,760
this particular credential or a bunch of

1685
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,600
credentials being carried in the update

1686
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,199
messages and it can be

1687
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,320
on the destination vtep which is also an

1688
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,520
access

1689
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,960
switch per se

1690
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,920
all right or as part of the

1691
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,679
first top first stop

1692
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,760
router or first stop switch i shouldn't

1693
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,199
say router

1694
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,199
for stop switch for the

1695
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,600
for the access network uh it can be

1696
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,520
synchronized so

1697
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,199
this uh

1698
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,800
security approval or this ir rt2

1699
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,800
based

1700
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,520
route publishing can be um

1701
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,040
appended with this new extended

1702
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,520
community and can be leveraged as a

1703
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,760
as a approval which has already happened

1704
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,920
at the other end of the network

1705
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,080
so

1706
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,760
yeah so this is what it is it's a

1707
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,080
simplex solution it's still

1708
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,280
i mean

1709
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,880
i'm not sure whether there are any

1710
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,960
parallel solutions already in place per

1711
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,520
se as as far as bgp control plane is

1712
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,840
concerned

1713
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,719
um and

1714
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,360
how it's dealt with at the at the

1715
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,040
receiving side how

1716
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,960
the security application running over

1717
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,159
there leverages this information is

1718
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,159
again implementation dependent but it's

1719
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,560
all about carrying this information

1720
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,239
as part of the

1721
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,560
mac update i understand that

1722
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,800
since it's extended community it would

1723
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,440
it would be applicable to all the mac ip

1724
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,440
updates which are being carried there

1725
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,840
but since it's deployed in one campus

1726
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,320
and where we expect every

1727
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,159
um

1728
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,960
every client to be uh

1729
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,760
to be to be uh sorted or to be to be

1730
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,960
allowed to be

1731
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,719
validated

1732
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,120
i think they should fall in place uh

1733
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,280
yeah

1734
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,159
and

1735
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,120
this is again the client type

1736
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,960
and there can be a

1737
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,760
sync id which can be configured at all

1738
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,239
the vteps or at all the

1739
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,880
bgp pairs which can be validated all

1740
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,679
across so this ip bins ip binding sync

1741
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,840
id is nothing but a

1742
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,640
instance or a security instance

1743
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,719
which needs to be in sync

1744
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,960
across all the

1745
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,920
vteps and it can be configured via the

1746
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,000
end operator and it can be double

1747
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,640
validated whether this mac ip binding is

1748
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,520
for that particular

1749
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,640
security instance

1750
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,800
so this

1751
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
can be generalized

1752
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,600
for all the fabrics and

1753
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,920
for all the

1754
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,199
bgp extensions for for vpn

1755
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,000
and it can also be extended

1756
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,239
if not in place for

1757
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,880
other control plane protocols

1758
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,199
like ldp if they are also being

1759
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,480
leveraged to

1760
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,040
provision the only protocols for mpls

1761
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,199
fabric

1762
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,840
yeps and the request is to

1763
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,360
for the best members to review this

1764
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,799
track and this is what it is here

1765
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,560
you can go ahead

1766
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,360
hey hi uh

1767
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,400
uh

1768
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,080
i think i'll have similar comment than

1769
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,520
the previous draft make sure the problem

1770
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,239
statement is very clear uh it's not here

1771
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,719
honestly so that will be the first uh

1772
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,840
things to do the second part is uh you

1773
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,640
you're putting a kind of a

1774
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,199
grouping id on

1775
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,199
on the assumption this is more secure

1776
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,280
but in fact that google id is not even

1777
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,280
secure so anybody can pitch in a number

1778
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,800
so i don't think you're making it more

1779
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,520
secure so therefore i will strongly

1780
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,440
suggest you to look at perhaps raw

1781
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,040
targets inflation or stuff like that

1782
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,719
which can do the same exactly the same

1783
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,679
job of bringing proper reptile 2 to the

1784
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,199
right router where they can do something

1785
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,000
meaningful with it

1786
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,880
yeah so i mean route targets yeah sure

1787
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,960
i'll answer that but it's in the

1788
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,880
comments i mean my thing is route

1789
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,840
targets are much lower in granularity

1790
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,320
which is applicable to let's say on a

1791
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,040
power vlan basis here i'm trying to map

1792
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,199
all of them to a security instance which

1793
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,320
can be

1794
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,840
mapped at least

1795
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,679
but they are still under a vlan right

1796
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,120
they are still under the vlan if you

1797
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,199
prefer the hp snooping you're snooping

1798
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,120
widely you're going to snoop for a

1799
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,520
specific vlan or specific interface or a

1800
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,520
specific broadcast domain

1801
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,679
so you still lie down to

1802
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,239
a lan at the end which is usually your

1803
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,320
avi and from ddi you're going to take

1804
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,560
your you can generate your raw targets

1805
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,080
based on that and then you can even go

1806
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,719
with perhaps something similar to e3

1807
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,400
where you can have different set of raw

1808
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,120
digest that will help you to do that

1809
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,199
but the grouping id definitely will not

1810
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,880
help you that much because anyway you

1811
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,000
need to

1812
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,080
you need to import the route then you

1813
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,920
need to look at the grouping id so if

1814
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,920
you're telling me the raw targets is too

1815
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,360
too much well you still have it you

1816
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,759
don't have a choice

1817
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,340
hi uh yeah my question is um

1818
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,520
[Music]

1819
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,600
yeah i don't know if i understood the

1820
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,320
draft uh completely but if the this

1821
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,239
binding id

1822
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,520
uh is

1823
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,600
the allocation is really out of the

1824
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,360
scope

1825
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,760
and what you do with it when you receive

1826
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,719
it

1827
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,800
it's it's also up to the implementation

1828
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,040
i was wondering if you can use just a

1829
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,760
regular community or a large community

1830
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,000
along with the mac ip routes or anything

1831
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,199
like that

1832
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,360
and then you you don't really need to

1833
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,360
standardize a new extended community i

1834
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,719
think

1835
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,280
can you comment on that

1836
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,600
yeah george so um

1837
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,800
i mean uh in this case we wanted to

1838
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,560
tie it to

1839
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,440
the mac ips only and keep it restricted

1840
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,400
keep it specified rather than doing

1841
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,080
leveraging the

1842
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,280
communities per se and

1843
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,920
we wanted to keep it let's say a

1844
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,400
standard tie-up in future evolution

1845
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,280
where we can extend this

1846
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,480
particular tlv to carry other parameters

1847
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,440
as well

1848
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,719
let's say

1849
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,880
the role can also be synchronized in

1850
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,840
future

1851
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,080
per se if the bunch of updates can be

1852
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,560
carried and that is also

1853
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,159
a part of

1854
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,040
the security update so having that in

1855
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,560
mind it was thought that we can do with

1856
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,679
a new uh

1857
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,199
a new attribute or uh as part of the

1858
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,000
extended community yeah so it's still in

1859
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,480
the under evolution i mean needs to

1860
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,520
evolve further to carry other attributes

1861
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,960
and that's the answer john

1862
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,800
okay but for the current solution uh you

1863
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
could actually use any

1864
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,120
communities really

1865
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,480
um yes that can be alternative but what

1866
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,480
i meant to say is we wanted to all maybe

1867
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,400
i should update it further distract your

1868
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,760
point don't it

1869
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,360
okay thank you

1870
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,759
thank you

1871
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,840
um

1872
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,159
nothing in here actually this is just we

1873
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,080
have updated with all the comments which

1874
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,679
we got in uh

1875
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,520
under vienna itf

1876
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,199
and that has been updated so we uh

1877
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,280
so uh the the

1878
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,800
all df

1879
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,440
bomb traffic was an important one where

1880
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,080
there were comments of um

1881
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,360
for the the actual use case

1882
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,400
being

1883
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,280
addressed there where we wanted all the

1884
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,400
um

1885
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,120
vteps in in a segment to act as a df in

1886
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,840
a case of a distributed active firewalls

1887
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,880
across

1888
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,840
all the across the fabrics so

1889
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,679
after attending the comments i haven't

1890
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:30,880
heard back

1891
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,920
from the best members who had given that

1892
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,920
comment so i'm still waiting there

1893
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,760
so i'm requesting them to have a look at

1894
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,840
the updated drops here

1895
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,719
and

1896
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,800
that's the update on the first one and

1897
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,199
the second one i have

1898
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,400
made that as a

1899
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,800
informational draft and

1900
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,840
yeah i'm still waiting for i can it it

1901
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,760
will help for the best members to

1902
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,960
comment on that as well

1903
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,960
so i see honey on

1904
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,280
queue yeah

1905
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,239
yeah hi um

1906
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,239
yeah for the second one i have no no

1907
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,320
comments it's i think it's a good thing

1908
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,920
to make it informational because it's

1909
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,040
really

1910
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,800
you know implementation specific and

1911
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,719
that's but it's good to document so

1912
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,520
that's fine for the

1913
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,280
old piece the df draft

1914
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,760
i have a couple of comments so the first

1915
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,600
one um

1916
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,840
so in the past we already discussed that

1917
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,320
you were actually requesting a df

1918
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,880
election algorithm

1919
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,600
that it was clashing with an existing

1920
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,040
working group

1921
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,679
document that was not

1922
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,120
called point two

1923
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,199
you changed it to three but

1924
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,640
unfortunately that one is also taken

1925
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,560
by your advanced uh recovery uh draft so

1926
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,600
please uh yeah i can do it as tbd george

1927
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,159
uh as of now yeah i can change it

1928
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520
to be

1929
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,400
yeah that is probably a better thank you

1930
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,120
and uh my last comment is that

1931
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,280
the df election that you are proposing

1932
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,080
is

1933
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,960
okay is just uh

1934
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,120
proposing that all the the ps in the

1935
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,159
ethernet segment can forward uh bomb

1936
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,360
traffic

1937
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
but then in the draft you are making

1938
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,159
some assumptions about the the way the

1939
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,520
remote p's are sending traffic to those

1940
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,880
firewalls

1941
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,560
and

1942
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
that is the part that i'm missing i'm

1943
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
still missing and i don't understand

1944
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,679
what you are doing there so

1945
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,159
probably we need more discussion in the

1946
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,719
in the mailing list

1947
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,960
sure

1948
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,920
it will be quick comment because i think

1949
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,840
we are really running out of time

1950
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
i need i need 20 seconds so patrice

1951
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,760
resets this consistent for the first

1952
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,560
drive on the all the f-bomb uh somehow

1953
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,800
there's already under the draft which is

1954
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,400
bringing the single flow active low

1955
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,560
balancing mode it is exactly doing what

1956
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,080
you're trying to do

1957
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,600
and i think you the way you put in the

1958
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,080
draft is wrong because your ac your esi

1959
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,000
is wrongly assigned to the proper device

1960
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,920
on the network but please have a look to

1961
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,520
the l2 gateway protocols draft for the

1962
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,040
second one and then them on the

1963
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,280
dampening back off i will strongly

1964
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,400
suggest you that you go over the evdn rb

1965
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,320
extended mobility draft from the

1966
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,520
rajmager it will solve your issue thank

1967
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,760

1977
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,560
uh emulation gaps and solutions uh in

1978
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,679
gaps and

1979
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,600
gaps and solutions of

1980
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,000
moving used in ipv6 infrastructure

1981
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,920
stress

the document

1998
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,840
i was published before itf 112. i

1999
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,600
requested a slot

2000
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,960
in itf-113 but missed the presentation

2001
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,560
because of the problem of microphone i

2002
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,159
started the minister discussion in may

2003
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,040
of this year and there is a long sleeve

2004
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,040
of technical discussion

2005
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,600
here this is the main problem

2006
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,679
uh

2007
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,960

01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,280
markers l i to match against rd and

2024
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,400
originator

2025
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,000
ip of corresponding intro sad

2026
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,480
the problem is that the sources field of

2027
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,800
the c multicast mr i

2028
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,320
is forbade lens cannot hold ipv6

2029
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,800
original interaction activities

2030
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,719
influence structure

2031
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,320
scenarios

2032
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,280
next slides please

2033
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,800
uh here's a proposed solution for the

2034
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,120
pro pro propagating control between

2035
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,400
asses

2036
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,280
svr still controls the c multicast

2037
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,840
prograding along with the result parcel

2038
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,840
into sad studio use rd of c multicast

2039
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,120
aoi match against audio's corresponding

2040
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,560
intro sad

2041
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,360
the modi cafe the modification is that

2042
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,120
the global administrative field of iv6 c

2043
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,480
multicast input artist indeed of

2044
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,600
sources field of c matrices

2045
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,320
to match against originator fc of

2046
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,800
corresponding inter sad

2047
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,040
so the solution is comply with the

2048
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,800
regular

2049
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,120
propagating procedure in rc6

2050
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,440
with the only modification to adapt the

2051
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,719
regular one

2052
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,880
to ipv6 in

2053
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,040
infrastructure scenario

2054
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,080
it is

2055
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,920
in dark generous

2056
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,280
propagating mechanism of mvp

2057
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,120
it should be noted that

2058
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,320
to do precisely x training of the c

2059
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,400
monica's import rtr sps the local

2060
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,040
administrator field should be filled

2061
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,239
with nonzero value even in

2062
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,800
gtm scenarios

2063
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,760
next slides please

2064
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,679
if there are only one root p for

2065
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:08,400
specific multiple source the solution

2066
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,120
prevails lag is enough

2067
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,679
here is a scenario that's a specific

2068
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,679
multicast source

2069
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,040
multi-homing to multiple routing piece

2070
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,280
the long segment inter

2071
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,080
semantically must be distinguished for

2072
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,480
each individual pe

2073
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,520
there are three options option one

2074
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,360
it should be configured with the

2075
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,400
distinct rd which is recommended in rfc

2076
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,960
rfc6514

2077
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,920
option two it should be configured with

2078
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,120
a distinct format moving distinguisher

2079
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,840
to be used to fill the sources field of

2080
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,120
c multicast noi

2081
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:49,679
or option

2082
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,159
she used a comma hash algorithm to

2083
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,600
calculate the

2084
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,639
uh 16 password type c to a format

2085
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,199
unicode distinguisher to fill the source

2086
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,840
field sources field of the c multicast

2087
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,120
aoi option 2 and option 3 are used in

2088
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,440
the scenario of

2089
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,120
all english p configured with a sim rd

2090
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,600
gtm as an example

2091
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,199
in this document

2092
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,600
the sources field

2093
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,120
in cinematic has no i is renamed to a

2094
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,159
loot decrease root distinguishable field

2095
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:29,600
you rename the true root distinguishable

2096
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,639
next slides please

2097
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,520
here is another problem

2098
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,040
in the progress we were reaching to ipv6

2099
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,480
ipv4 and

2100
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:49,040
ipv6 infrastructure stress will co-exist

2101
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,280
in the provider's network

2102
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,520
the following figure is an example of

2103
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,760
bgpc and watching evolution to ipv6

2104
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,360
i wish for an

2105
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,760
six parallel php

2106
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,080
sessions are established and the number

2107
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,159
of the passes of

2108
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,360
these routes

2109
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,840
will be doubled with each reflection

2110
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,480
next slide please

2111
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,040
here is a proposed solution to reduce

2112
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,480
bgpm european routes in power fpv4 and

2113
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,600
ipv6 pvp station networks

2114
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,560
the following action should be taken by

2115
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,159
sender pes

2116
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:35,520
for intro as ibm lady roots spms

2117
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,639
educates and unified if the originator

2118
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,120
is looters at your address field in

2119
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,920
route is filled with the ipv6 address it

2120
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,120
is sent to

2121
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,239
uh ipcwi6 ptpc neighbor otherwise it's

2122
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,920
not to ipv for bp neighbors for intel as

2123
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,040
ibm's 80 roots and source active a route

2124
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,560
it is sent to both ipv6 bp labor and ip

2125
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,360
with four bp labels for c multiple

2126
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,880
routes it is if the ipv6 vr

2127
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,480
would import

2128
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,800
external community exists in the route

2129
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,960
it is sent to ipv6 bp labels ios is sent

2130
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,360
to ipv4 bp neighbors

2131
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,239
in the reflected returns the part of

2132
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:21,199
routes which are received from ipv6

2133
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,080
speak labor will be reflected to other

2134
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,360
actually

2135
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,440
six speed levels and the other part of

2136
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,239
the routes which are received from ipv4

2137
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,360
btp label will be flicked be will be

2138
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,880
reflected to other ipv4 pc labels

2139
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,639
next

2140
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,520
slide please

2141
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,480
next slides please

2142
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,120
uh if you have any comments we can

2143
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:52,880
continue to discuss it in many needs

2144
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,760
i

2145
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,000
think the issue and the solution

2146
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,120
described in this document is clear and

2147
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,719
coupled pencil

2148
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,480
so i want to initiate a adoption call

2149
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,520
this time

2150
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,480
that's all thank you

2151
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,239
okay let's just uh

2152
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,040
um

2153
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,560
comment to the list and we'll move on to

2154
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,480
the next one please

2155
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,480
yep

2156
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:30,710
[Laughter]

2157
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,719
someone is laughing or

2158
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,840
i think it's fine i think you're

2159
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,239
breaking up

2160
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,880
okay

2161
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,120
hello everyone i'm

2162
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,520
from huawei

2163
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,400
next slide please

2164
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,600
this draft was

2165
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,199
presented in

2166
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,679
last itf conference

2167
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,199
and was refreshed a little bit so i will

2168
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:22,719
talk it in brief

2169
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,679
rfc

2170
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:28,480
1926 brings out the concept of

2171
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,000
cold warm and hot roots standby

2172
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,600
and also defines downstream piece umh

2173
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,920
selection based on paternal status for

2174
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,480
mvpn fast failover

2175
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,600
but in some use cases

2176
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,040
determine the status of a paternal is

2177
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,400
unavailable for a downstream pe as

2178
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,880
listed on the slide

2179
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,840
so

2180
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,880
we think it could be feasible for the

2181
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,239
up for the upstream ps to participate

2182
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,040
more

2183
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,199
for the failed lower

2184
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,759
next slide please

2185
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,940
next slide please

2186
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,560
[Music]

2187
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,800
okay

2188
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,880
we hope to use some existing methods

2189
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,000
for the selection uh take

2190
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,199
uh the vrp for example

2207
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,320
would be optional

2208
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,600
okay next slide please

2209
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,718
uh

2210
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,280
oh or

2211
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,840

however the standby pe community is no

2219
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,159
longer necessary because the upstream

piece and the forwarded to ces

2227
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,199
it's a kind of any caster rpf checking

2228
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,440
the civil

2229

2231
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,599
df selection as mentioned above

2232
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,800
also next slide please

2233
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,239
we are seeking for

uh but we are going to talk about the

2250
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:36,320
first things here the first part is

2251
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,480
instruction about the water solution is

2252
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,840
in the draft

2253
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:40,800
and we

2254
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,840
will briefly talk about the program

2255
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,000
what we will serve up

2256
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,239
and the solutions that we are defining

2257
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,280
in the draft and is in the next step

2258
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,920
let's try please

2259
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,600
this draft

2260
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,600

2262
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,280

the main requirement

2268
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,239
is

2269
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,239
how to identify

2277
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,679

best ep vpws seamless is assuming in

2279
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,400
figure

2280
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,400
in the first step

2281
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,840
the both p act as a rule of the latency

2282
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,080
pe they send the

2283
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,400

2286
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,400
the second step the p1 upgrade to

2287
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,239

the third step

2291
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,560
the p2 upgraded to the camsed pe and it

2292

then

2297
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,119
the last last step the p1 or p2 should

2298
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:40,960

2363
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,840
the p may

2364
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,639
bring the l2 vpn

2365
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:47,840
sudo where

2366
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,679
of recently done

2367
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,199
and

2368
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,520
and should select the

2369
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,440
the correct european internet

2370
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:01,920
uh if you pre-evaluate high priority

2371
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,840
uh next slide please

2372
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,719
so the next step for this draft is

2373
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:10,400
basically we are seeking the more

2374
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,239
feedback

2375
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:15,559
that's all

2376
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,560
uh first of all thank you for the draft

2377
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,520
um second though uh as you as you notice

2378
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,719
already the seamless uh videos and less

2379
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,880
graph that i carry since a couple of

2380
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,840
years

2381
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,760
uh where we are already shipping and

2382
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,040
have

2383
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,480
co-authored from

2384
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:42,000
various also uh providers so

2385
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,440
may i suggest that

2386
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,080
we should look definitely at the

2387
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,679
solution i'm not convinced this is the

2388
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,600
right one by the way but there's the

2389
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,520
problem is real so we should look at the

2390
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,600
solution and i will strongly suggest

2391
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,840
that we enhance the current graph that

2392
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,679
everyone has already adapted for the

2393
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,679
sigmas

2394
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:13,119
[Music]

2395
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,040
yeah so if comment was not clear maybe

2396
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,480
you can send in the list as well

2397
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,440
the comment is very simple is i strongly

2398
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,440
suggest that we enhance the current

2399
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,679
seamless draft that we have already for

2400
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,480
vpwrest the prom is real i'm not sure

2401
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,520
about

2402
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,000
what what is suggested here is the right

2403
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,639
solution but definitely a solution must

2404
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,960
be proposed and it should be part of the

2405
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,000
one that everyone's already corrupting

2406
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,040
okay

2407
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,280
okay

2408
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,000
yeah so

2409
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:55,920
yeah i i kind of agree with patrice so

2410
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,040
the solution is in the evpn vws seamless

2411
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,080
draft

2412
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,920
although it's

2413
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,159
hidden so it has to be

2414
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,239
made explicit

2415
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,760
and there are

2416
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,159
different solutions we could think about

2417
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,360
um

2418
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,679
you could even think about using the you

2419
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:14,560
know

2420
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,480
in ipv4 and next hop on the srv6 route

2421
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,679
that you can easily compare with an ipv4

2422
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,360
nexup from the

2423
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,199
pseudo-wire route

2424
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,719
or the other way around you could use

2425
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,199
the same might be the sex address

2426
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,800
because this is

2427
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,280
normally for migration purposes

2428
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,400
and even if you wanted to define a way

2429
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,119
to

2430
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,480
identify the

2431
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,920
the origin

2432
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,920
pe

2433
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,719
we

2434
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,000
we have an old draft that defined at the

2435
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,400
originating p

2436
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,040
it was at the time was used for inter es

2437
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,639
option b

2438
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:53,600
and

2439
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,880
we could actually

2440
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,400
uh

2441
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,639
you know resurrect that draft because it

2442
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,119
really makes sense to generalize the

2443
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,040
the identification of the pe

2444
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,360
if it is needed but but again it has to

2445
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,080
be discussed in the context of this evpn

2446
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,800
vpws seamless draft

2447
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,560
thank you

2448
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,880

2449
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,719
