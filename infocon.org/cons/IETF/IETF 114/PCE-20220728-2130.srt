00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
to use the meet echo lite client there

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
are qr codes as well we will be using

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
meet echo to maintain our cues uh please

17
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
help your remote chairs

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
to do that

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
quite well

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
and

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
make sure to wear mask that is something

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
that you agreed at the time of

please help hurry out i've put the link

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319

37
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
in the chat as well

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840

when you are speaking please state your

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,480
name

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
uh we have not too much of a tight

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
agenda so there is a discussion time we

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
will use it but in case we overrun of

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
course please use the mailing list and

45
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,079
the chat for further discussion

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
so we covered segment routing which was

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,239
in part one of our agenda today we have

48
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
then starting with stateful pce

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,680
some uh new proposals on tetnet

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
and uh nrp id in psep so these are the

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
next set of presentations that we have

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,519
uh today

53
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
okay so is mike uh

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
yes mike is here good so let me pull up

55
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
your presentation

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
and let's start with our first

57
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
presentation of the day

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
uh mike i'll be giving you

59
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
just one second mike i'll be giving you

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
slight control so you should have it now

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
you should be able to move

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,720
slides yourself

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
uh okay yeah thanks

64
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
uh hi everybody this is mike from cisco

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
systems

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
i'm presenting the psep operational

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,399
clarifications draft

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
so i just to give a brief summary of the

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,840
draft there's about six points that we

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
cover in the draft so some of these

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
points are basically informational and

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
some of these

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
are like normative uh

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
so i'll go through these six points so

75
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
first and kind of

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
very important we introduce this

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
optimization to the psep

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,238
protocol where we make the pc request

79
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,120
and pc reply messages

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
optional

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
and this basically reduces the amount of

82
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
messages that you need to send when

83
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,479
bringing up

84
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
the tunnel

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
instead of sending three messages you

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
basically just have to send one message

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
so before you have to send a pc request

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
then wait for pc reply and then p sent

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,880
the

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
report

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
and now we basically simplified by

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
allowing you to send the report

93
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
so

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
we're not sure like basically why it was

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
done that way originally but

96
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,919
it seems that

97
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,320
a lot of vendors are are doing it so

98
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,240
so this will be an update to the rfc8231

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
next point is we uh we introduced kind

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
of

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
this terminology for what is a p sub

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
tunnel versus a psep lsp

103
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
and the tunnel is is the entity that's

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
identified by the pspid

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,759
symbolic name

106
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,680
versus the lsp is

107
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
is an instance of the tunnel

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
that's used for make before break

109
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
and the lsp is identified by the lsp

110
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,000
identifiers tlv

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
so just even introducing these two names

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
is i think useful uh in other drafts as

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
well

114
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,360
um third

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
we

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
clarified the

117
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
that the psep association contains lsps

118
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
and not tunnels i'm not sure if it was

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,599
very clear before

120
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
but we just kind of stated

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
explicitly

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
and it's still possible that a tunnel

123
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,080
can be in the association when all the

124
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
cell speeds are in the association

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
and it's possible that some of the lsps

126
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
may be in one association and some may

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
be in the other such as when you're

128
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
changing from when the tunnel is

129
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
changing from one association to the

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
other

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,759
in a make before break fashion

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
uh fourth point fourthly we

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
give some examples of

134
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
of various lsp

135
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
operations that can happen

136
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,680
where we saw basically different

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
vendors have like interop issues

138
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
uh so we just explicitly walk through

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
uh many examples

140
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,360
uh

141
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
fifth point is we

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
we clarify

143
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,199
um

144
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
that

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,800
how do you how

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
how some objects do not have an explicit

147
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
removal flag

148
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,680
and we saw some basically

149
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
interrupt issues where

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
uh

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
where an implementation would expect

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
a constraint to be not removed if it's

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
sent

154
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
if it didn't send the object so say like

155
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
it sent the lspa object for example

156
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,199
in one message and then

157
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
in the next message it didn't send it

158
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
but it kind of expected that the

159
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,080
constraint

160
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
was still applicable

161
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
so we explicitly say that

162
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,599
if the

163
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
if the object does not have an explicit

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
removal flag

165
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
then the absence of the object

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
means a removal of the constraint that

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
the object

168
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
represents

169
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
and sixth sixth and final point is we

170
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,199
discourage the use of the rro

171
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
uh so the ro was

172
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
is is an rcpte concept

173
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
where like the

174
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
resv message will

175
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
go back or the pathogen as we actually

176
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,520
both go and collect

177
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
hub by help information into this record

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,039
route

179
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
object

180
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
and

181
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,599
[Music]

182
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,159
for sr there's no such

183
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
thing

184
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
there's no record route for sr so

185
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
basically we're not sure really why it

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
was these srro

187
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
objects were defined

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
and some vendors kind of

189
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
mistake a mistake the rro to be like uh

190
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
a current well i don't want to say

191
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
mistake but they they treat the ro to be

192
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
like a current path

193
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
and the ero to be like a desired path

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,359
or something like that

195
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
and so yeah it led to

196
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
again some confusion so we just want to

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
settle that

198
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,279
by discouraging the use of sr rro

199
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
because our always rcpt concept

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
so here's some just brief history so

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
this draft was

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
first introduced in itf 110

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,720
in july 2019 so like uh three years ago

204
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,519
and since then there was not much

205
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
uh there were some additions but there

206
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,160
were no fundamental kind of changes

207
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,200
so we got some recently some good

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,959
comments from adrian

209
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
on the mailing list

210
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
which i addressed in the latest version

211
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
so basically yeah i wanted

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
to make this presentation kind of quick

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
uh

214
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
to give room for questions so

215
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
and comments so basically

216
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
uh the the thing with this draft is it

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
has both uh

218
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
informational and normative content

219
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,120
and i think that's fine i saw quite a

220
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
bit of other drafts or at least a couple

221
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
other drafts that have the same uh

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
the same structure so what did what

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
i saw down is that

224
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
they spell out which sections are

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
informative and which are normative

226
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
uh

227
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
and

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
yeah so we kind of have kind of

229
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,519
three options either we

230
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
separate the different sections and and

231
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,399
say which which two are standard track

232
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,200
versus informational

233
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
uh or we break the draft into basically

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
two drafts

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
so

236
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
yeah so basically i i would like to

237
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
request work group adoption

238
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
on this

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,279
of this draft

240
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
uh that's all for the presentation um

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
thanks

242
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
thank you mike uh first any questions on

243
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
the mic uh

244
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,519
we have time so people wanna

245
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
talk about the issues we can do that

246
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,800
otherwise this question

247
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
which is right on your screen can also

248
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,160
be answered i see johnny in the cube

249
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
um

250
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
since you uh since you

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
bring up the question on this slide

252
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
um

253
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
i guess i would have a mild preference

254
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
for

255
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,279
uh keep it option one keep it in a

256
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
single draft and clearly separate the

257
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,000
two kinds of content

258
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah yeah that's uh same with me yeah i

259
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
think

260
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,959
sometimes it's it's kind of hard to say

261
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,480
what exactly is

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,279
uh

263
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
informational versus standard there's

264
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,360
not like a very clear line so

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
having it in one draft makes it a little

266
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
bit easier

267
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
than to have you know that content

268
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,079
balance between two two different drafts

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
so i agree with you

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,880
andrew

271
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
yeah pretty basically going to echo the

272
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
same thing i uh meant to reply to the

273
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,600
list but drew kind of raised those you

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,079
know what what is the way to kind of

275
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,279
document this whether we want to split

276
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
it up or have one draft and i really

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,880
kind of see the operational draft as

278
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
almost like a checkpoint on the you know

279
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,880
the implementations of pc

280
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
with a lot of implementations now have

281
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
kind of converged on what's being

282
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
described in this document and so since

283
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
there is some updates and clarifications

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
and it is kind of that you know

285
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,760
checkpoint kind of you know from my view

286
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
i do like option one and keeping in the

287
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
same draft and just

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
describe which is doing specific updates

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
versus which is just doing

290
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
clarifications

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
um and with that of course you know

292
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
since as an implementer

293
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
to get to this convergence with a lot of

294
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
vendors it's it's a really good thing so

295
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
i do believe we should adopt this thank

296
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
you

297
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
yeah

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,760
uh any more comments from anyone

299
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,639
uh so uh

300
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
from my point of view

301
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
my mild preference would be two separate

302
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,040
drafts but of course like working group

303
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
uh preference would take over that's

304
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
just me as an individual and mainly

305
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
because when i currently read the draft

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
i find like you know the separation is

307
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
as you yourself said that this

308
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
separation is hard to do and

309
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,120
that's why in a single document i kind

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
of found it to be little hard because we

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
we say and update and immediately we

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
jump into an example and then we start

313
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,639
going into an example which actually

314
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,680
doesn't

315
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,639
change

316
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,800
anything from

317
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,399
rfc8231 but it's just explaining it in a

318
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
much better way i thought that if we do

319
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
it in a single document we should

320
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,839
clearly

321
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,120
uh find a good way to separate things uh

322
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,959
talk about like you know maybe start

323
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
with an update

324
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,079
as in like what are the normative

325
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,120
changes upfront and then go into

326
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
examples and say that once this

327
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,199
normative changes have been applied now

328
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
these are the set of examples which will

329
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
clearly explain how things are currently

330
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
functioning so

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,639
i will try to work with you guys and see

332
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
if we can like you know make this very

333
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
very clear clear what is an update and

334
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,639
what is just

335
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,519
uh

336
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
like you know just explaining things in

337
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,519
a much better way like when you bring in

338
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
terms like a piece of tunnel i think it

339
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
is useful but it's we should be clear

340
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
that we are not changing anything

341
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,519
because basically for external person

342
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,920
for an implementer this is easy but for

343
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
an external person i feel review would

344
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,440
become harder if he reads rfc8231 and

345
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
then suddenly he comes here and say oh

346
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,199
what is this term how do i relate this

347
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
term the rest of the text

348
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
in rfc8231 so we have to be just a

349
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
little bit more careful with this

350
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
sure yeah i mean what i saw in other

351
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
drafts is like they they say in the

352
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
beginning of the document they say like

353
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
sections xyz are informational

354
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,800
and sections uh you know whatever else

355
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,240
abc are uh normative

356
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
and that way

357
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,360
it's all kind of in one document

358
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
but i'm open to anything like if you

359
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,880
know whatever the word group consensus

360
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,519
is we can we can work with that uh

361
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
i see julian uh

362
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
once you have a button go ahead julian

363
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
yeah i just wanted to say that it seems

364
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
that no one is interested in option

365
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,519
three

366
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
but we we should probably take to the

367
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600
list uh the discussion between option

368
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
one and option two

369
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,519
i also have personal preference for

370
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
option one

371
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
uh clear separate uh for uh option two

372
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
sorry sorry uh clear separation with two

373
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,519
different documents is probably

374
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
a clear way to proceed but uh i think

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
that the working group need to discuss

376
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
this more on the list

377
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
and we'll follow the consensus between

378
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
one and two so

379
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
sure i think we should move this

380
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
discussion to the to the list but

381
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
clearly there are interesting material

382
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
there uh the working group should work

383
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,480
on that

384
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,279
so

385
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,160
this discussion is rather an editorial

386
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
uh split of the work rather than

387
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
delaying anything on

388
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,279
the

389
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
procedure and the adoption

390
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,320
okay

391
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
thanks

392
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,839
thank you mike

393
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,199
the next one is giuseppe right

394
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,000
yes so let me bring a new presentation

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,880
hello can you hear me

396
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
yes yes

397
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,519
oh you are remote i was for a minute not

398
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
sure

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
i'll give you slight control

400
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,880
you should have it now

401
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,520
okay i can i can see this live yeah

402
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
[Music]

403
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
hello everybody uh this is a

404
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,160
an update about the psep

405
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,040
extension to enable uh ifit

406
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
so the the draft has been

407
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,679
recently adopted as you can see this is

408
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,480
a zero zero version of draft atf

409
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
and i'm presenting on behalf of the

410
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,678
quotas so next slide

411
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
bro so you can move the slides yourself

412
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
uh okay

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
it's in the bottom of the screen as well

414
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
as arrow

415
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
okay

416
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
yeah just few words about the background

417
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
and motivation so

418
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
to remind

419
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
um

420
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
the the scope of this graph so if it is

421
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
stands for institute for information

422
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
telemetry and

423
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
just a name to reverse

424
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
together two in c2im that is defined in

425
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,440
rfc 91 and p7 and alternate marking that

426
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
is currently

427
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,640
defined in these two experimental rfc

428
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
but

429
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
there is also work to elevate

430
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,799
these two rfc a 321 lease and 889 these

431
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,919
two

432
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,640
proposal standards so the psap extension

433
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
they find this document allowed to

434
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,160
signal these effect capabilities

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
and the ifit attributes can be

436
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
generalized

437
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
as tld to be carried in

438
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
inside the lsapa object

439
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,799
so

440
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,679
we

441
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
choose this option in order to be able

442
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
to be applied for raw path types as long

443
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
as they support the relevant telemetry

444
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
methodology

445
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,240
so

446
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,200
we firstly define the a-fit capability

447
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,919
tlv as an optional tlb in the open

448
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,039
object

449
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
for the capability advertised

450
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,200
so we define in the flags five flags for

451
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
now so four for

452
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,679
uh ion and

453
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,360
one for alternate marking

454
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
and in addition to the capability

455
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,000
advertisement tld we define the ifita

456
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
butyl vin that provides the let's say

457
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
the configurable knobs of the feature

458
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
so and this can be included as a tlb in

459
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
the in the spa object

460
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
there are um

461
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,600
also in this case five different

462
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,480
subjects defined

463
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
i didn't put here the detail of the

464
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,760
subtlety since they were presented

465
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
several times but you can look at the

466
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
draft so in the end there are four also

467
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,280
in this case for institution and the one

468
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
for alternate machine

469
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
the efit attribute lbs are carried as a

470
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
side in the lspa object and can be

471
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
applicable to all part types

472
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
of course they are optional and can be

473
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
considered

474
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
during path computation and path setup

475
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,639
in stateful pce model

476
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
just few words to summarize the working

477
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
group adoption discussion so

478
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,679
we still need to address old comments

479
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
since the suggestion from the chair was

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
to publish the zero zero version

481
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,840
as is the last version of our draft and

482
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,159
then we plan to publish a new version in

483
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,799
coming weeks to address all the comments

484
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,280
that we receive during the adoption call

485
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,000
in this slide i just want to summarize

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
the main comment the main comments and

487
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
main suggestions that we will address

488
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
so first of all a clarification on the

489
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,760
head and support of the heat capability

490
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,880
so

491
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,799
it is supposed that there are at least

492
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,720
two nodes of course that

493
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
at least starting and then the node with

494
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
sha which are which support the feed

495
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,640
capability

496
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
um

497
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,159
it was also suggest to mention the

498
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,600
example for ipv6 since for fpv6 bottle

499
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
iom and alternate marking

500
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
can be implemented through an extension

501
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
header so by leveraging the pset

502
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
extension correcting materialp for

503
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
example

504
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
then it was asked to

505
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
include more details about the

506
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,520
relationship between the

507
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,679
drafting idr on sr policy effect so

508
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
it is important to realize that both

509
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,799
both pcep and bgp can be used to

510
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,200
for example to instantiate the sub

511
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
policy so it is reasonable to have

512
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
the same ifit mechanisms for pizza and

513
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,640
bgps a1

514
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,559
even though as i said the for precept

515
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,840
the

516
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
let's say the application and the f8

517
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
attributes can be applicable to old path

518
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
types not only towards our points

519
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,679
then of course the use of the ifit

520
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,840
terminology and the related framework

521
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
will be clarified in the end

522
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
we had also

523
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,559
several editorial comments from adrian

524
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,960
and we will address also these these

525
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
comments to improve the readability of

526
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
the document itself

527
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
okay okay just few words about the next

528
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,720
step so

529
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
as i said we plan to address all the

530
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,960
comments in the

531
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,799
zero one version

532
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
and we always welcome

533
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,840
additional inputs and suggests so thank

534
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,480
you everybody

535
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,960
in the queue

536
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
uh charges up here this is adrian

537
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,080
farrell thank you for staying up so late

538
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
uh

539
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,360
um

540
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
i i don't know if you i'm sure you are

541
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
aware that there was a

542
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
draft in the ops area working group

543
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
a framework for ifit

544
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
uh that kind of ran into a roadblock

545
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
and was

546
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,280
sent to at least be discussed in uh ippm

547
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
uh but nothing seems that happened with

548
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
it and and your draft here isn't um

549
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
making reference to that framework at

550
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,360
all

551
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
i i wondered if you if you see any

552
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,200
relationship or whether it's safe to go

553
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
ahead without a framework document

554
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
guiding us

555
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,840
yeah

556
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
we didn't add them a clear reference to

557
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
the

558
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
to the effed framework because

559
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
mainly because it was not adopted

560
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
and because

561
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,960
yeah we also believe that with a fit we

562
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
can simply

563
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,760
they know the two methodology in c2im

564
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,080
and alternate marking

565
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
and

566
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,840
since we didn't

567
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
mention the framework in this graph we

568
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,799
cannot omit the reference

569
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,840
but

570
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,919
if there is consensus i can also add the

571
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,000
reference because we also receive a

572
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
comment that suggests that you add the

573
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
reference to the framework

574
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
even if this is only a building block of

575
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
the world framework so

576
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,520
maybe the framework need

577
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,320
to reference this document so because

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
this is only a building block of the

579
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,159
word trainer so

580
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
we can add the reference but

581
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
it's not so

582
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
so in my opinion

583
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,640
it can be done but it's not crucial

584
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,840
but can be discussed

585
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
yeah uh how do you survey i think this

586
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
the term i fit either by reference or by

587
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,480
description

588
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
in the document needs to be clarified

589
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
because otherwise even when we call our

590
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,279
tlbs ifit tles it should be better if

591
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
it's very clear what ifit

592
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
really means

593
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,919
yeah so i think uh by some mechanism we

594
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
need to solve this there was one more

595
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
comment uh in the

596
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
in when i was browsing through the

597
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
adoption call was about mpls so has

598
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
there any been discussion on that like

599
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
any change with

600
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,240
scope whether this document has sr mpls

601
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
in scope or not

602
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,240
yeah you are right you are right and

603
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,000
i will clarify that

604
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
for now because we didn't mention srm

605
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
pls as an example so maybe

606
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,840
it's not there is only a section so yeah

607
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
we can omit

608
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,640
srm pls for now and the reference to the

609
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
in particular i think that greg

610
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,440
was referring to

611
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
the draft on

612
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
mpls

613
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,480
that has not

614
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,799
been adopted yet so maybe we can just

615
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
omit that reference and

616
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,000
yeah yeah thank you for reminding me

617
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
it's it's another thing that i have to

618
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,600
fix

619
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
yeah

620
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
my thing is like just track it because

621
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
right now we have just adopted it so

622
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
even if

623
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
uh the work is ongoing in mpls working

624
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,880
group it's fine uh let's just track it

625
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
i think like you know this scope of

626
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
having mpls in scope is important

627
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,919
we should keep it either we can decide

628
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,480
later whether like you know if that that

629
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,320
work is taking too long

630
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,679
whether we need to divide this into

631
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,600
multiple documents that we can handle

632
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,039
later but within the scope of this

633
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,200
document just keep track of the mpls

634
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,799
stuff as well

635
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,080
yeah of course

636
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
i hope that they will find a solution

637
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
soon because for now there there are

638
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,200
different solutions on the table and

639
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
yeah we have to follow also the

640
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
discussion in mtls and hopefully they

641
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,320
will finish before

642
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,120
the

643
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
the publication of this involvement of

644
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
course

645
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,840
thank you

646
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,240
and just a small reminder uh like since

647
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
you have documents in idr as well as

648
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
this just from the start take care of

649
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,000
coordination take care of like no the

650
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,320
documents remain in sync

651
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,559
thank you yeah okay

652
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,679
okay

653
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,880
so

654
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
let's move on to the next presentation

655
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,080
thank you

656
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,240
thank you

657
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
so next we have two presentations on

658
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
technet uh

659
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,799
these are very early solution document

660
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,200
the work in that net is still

661
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,480
ongoing

662
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
uh this is mainly for information

663
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,480
purpose for pc working

664
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
so let's start

665
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
and let me give you guys thank you

666
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
and i'm tran uh from zte my presentation

667
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
today is the psap extension for that let

668
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,799
abandoned latency

669
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,480
and

670
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
so

671
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,720
let's first discuss the requirement for

672
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,159
the uh deathlet and the psap

673
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
in the flat it is required to

674
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,159
consider

675
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
uh the abandoned latency or for past

676
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
selection to achieve the deadline cues

677
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
such as

678
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,799
minimum and their maximum end-to-end

679
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,720
latency and the bandit jitter um

680
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,559
as for as per itf data controller plane

681
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
framework and the path should be

682
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,520
calculated and established in control

683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,840
play to guarantee the deterministic

684
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,279
transmission so the uh end-to-end bandit

685
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,919
latency uh constraints should be taken

686
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
into consideration um and the idf that's

687
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,679
not bound in the latency the

688
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,480
uh

689
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
end-to-end delaying bombs can

690
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
be presented as their sum of low uh

691
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,159
queueing delay bound and the queuing

692
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,440
delay bound along the path so the q two

693
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
mechanisms and the parameters should be

694
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,640
determined during the uh past compute

695
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
computation so this document describes

696
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,720
the extensions for gsaf to

697
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,279
carry bonded latency constraints and

698
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
distribute the

699
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
deterministic paths for end-to-end

700
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,279
popul

701
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,240
computation in deadlock service

702
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,620
and

703
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,760
[Music]

704
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,679
and for the psap extension first we

705
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,919
proposed two um metrics uh carried in

706
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,039
metric

707
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,080
object first one is the the end-to-end

708
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
banded and then latency metric

709
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
uh their second one is the end to end

710
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,679
bandit jitter

711
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,440
there are two metrics will be uh carried

712
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,159
to

713
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,440
uh request a deterministic path to meet

714
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,480
the end-to-end banded latency we also

715
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,960
request a d bit in asp extended flag tre

716
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,159
so

717
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,640
another preset extensions

718
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
is we

719
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
propose

720
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
the uh to uh extend their q information

721
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,399
to distribute the past uh

722
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,880
computation uh how to carry their

723
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
queuing information is not determined so

724
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,919
far we propose to

725
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,760
extend the queue information structure

726
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,960
to be carried in ero siero or sre 6ero

727
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,799
but new sub uh

728
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,760
sub objects also may make sense we will

729
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,840
consider that another version

730
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,360
so

731
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,919
uh last step uh

732
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,720
we

733
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,799
we want we would like to thank the

734
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,039
comments from doof in the mailing list

735
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
we will consider to propose new queuing

736
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,760
as sub objects for psap and paranoid

737
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,799
with their rsvpt similarly in nasa

738
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
version and the last version we will

739
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,960
list out the requirements for uh psap

740
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
and get confirmed uh confirmation from

741
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,120
deathlet and we will align with the

742
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,880
terminologies of a requirements uh draft

743
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,200
so uh comments and the suggestions are

744
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,159
very welcome thank you

745
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,279
thank you

746
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,000
uh janus

747
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
hi everyone janusz

748
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
with ericsson as dhruv mentioned in the

749
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,279
beginning we are in a very early stage

750
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,240
of like extending the death network to

751
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,559
address newer requirements and

752
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
and these are individual contributions

753
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,600
uh what uh we see here

754
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,240
for my personal perspective very much

755
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,360
ahead of

756
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,039
where we are in in that net we are

757
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
trying to come to consensus with the

758
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
requirements

759
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
and then we have a lot of solution

760
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,919
proposals on the table we need to build

761
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,320
up consensus on which way to go

762
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,399
and after figuring out the solution

763
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,080
from my perspective it comes the

764
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
encoding of

765
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,320
uh what fields are needed and so on to

766
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,640
to to meet the solution

767
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
as for the

768
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,519
information between

769
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
pc and the devices

770
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,080
the flow information rfc could be have

771
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,480
full as well because that already uh

772
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,120
defines the end-to-end delay budget and

773
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,919
and

774
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,320
that kind of parameters required for for

775
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,240
that net flows so that's already an

776
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,480
input and as for the queuing

777
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
part i think

778
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,200
it might be good to wait a bit until the

779
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,799
work is becoming more mature in that

780
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,960
thank you thank you

781
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
andrew thank you

782
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
um janis might have actually answered my

783
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
question from reading the document i

784
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,559
wasn't quite sure

785
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,039
how pc learns the processing delay of

786
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,480
the routers on the path

787
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,919
is there another document somewhere

788
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,440
where that information is kind of

789
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,600
averaged out or published

790
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,279
otherwise i'm not sure how pc takes that

791
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,080
into consideration

792
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,080
yes the itp uh advertisement

793
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,480
folder load delay will be

794
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
uh advertisement uh

795
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,799
before the

796
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,840
past computation

797
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
okay it might be helpful just to

798
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
reference that and that way we know

799
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,559
where that value kind of comes from

800
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,919
thank you oh thank you

801
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,880
thank you thank you

802
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
sorry a little slow on the unmute um

803
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
to add to what janice said i just want

804
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
to point out that in the debt networking

805
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
group we have a controller plane

806
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,519
framework document that's still open and

807
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,159
accepting contributions it's a

808
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,919
working group document but it's not done

809
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,440
yet and

810
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,640
if this work helps inform that or anyone

811
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,159
inside this working group has uh

812
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,480
material they'd like to either add or

813
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,320
see covered for example the last

814
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,760
question the response answer the last

815
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,600
question uh it'd be great to bring that

816
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,240
into that uh that document just send to

817
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
the list any contribution you have thank

818
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,399
you

819
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,760
thank you thank you luke

820
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,960
any more comments

821
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,879
yeah uh thank you my suggestion which i

822
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
mentioned in the mailing list as well i

823
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,119
think to all the solution documents like

824
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,079
have clear reference to that network

825
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,399
uh preferably if there are requirements

826
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
which are clearly listed for the

827
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
protocols it will be easier for us to

828
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,440
match those requirements into the

829
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,119
extensions that we are developing in

830
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,199
psep and i see that you are have

831
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,440
documents in spring and idr as well so

832
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,239
that will help you also to make sure

833
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,159
that things are aligned so from the

834
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,560
start uh follow that process that would

835
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,399
be quite helpful and also the

836
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,079
terminology be very clear with the

837
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,879
terminology refer terms which are

838
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,800
defined in that net documents so that

839
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
there are no confusion especially for

840
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,599
folks

841
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,159
uh like who are new to debt debt and who

842
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,320
who want to make sure that like you know

843
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
we can still review the debt network for

844
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,680
psap

845
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,720
uh easily so do help us to do this uh

846
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,040
nicely thank you

847
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,680
thank you dr

848
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
okay

849
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
let me

850
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,920
bring in the next presentation

851
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,040
let me give you slight control

852
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,599
you should have slight control now

853
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,640
uh yes yes

854
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,520
uh hello arrowhead

855
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
uh

856
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
hello everyone this is strongly from

857
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,560
huawei we did a pcp attention for

858
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,839
enhancer that night

859
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,640
uh vietnamese deterministic

860
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,800
network architecture is

861
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,520
described in rfc 865 file the data

862
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,240
enterprises are capability to carry

863
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
specified data follows with the

864
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,599
extremely low data loss risk and the

865
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,640
bounded

866
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,119
under to under languages with a network

867
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,480
domain

868
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,640
rfc file 440 describes the puzzle

869
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
communication

870
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,800
element pressure for communications

871
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
between path combination client analysis

872
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,440
of path compilation element

873
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,079
or two option to

874
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,359
pass the communication elements

875
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,560
pcp defines the interaction under the

876
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,119
data format of full path computation

877
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,760
requests under password communication

878
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,520
replies between pcc and the pce

879
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,839
traffic vestige

880
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,119
that's not enhanced data

881
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
so that's not a data plan by introducing

882
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
bonded lantern information which

883
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,079
facilitates detonator transmit

884
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,720
translate notes to guarantee the

885
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,800
boundaries of language transmission in

886
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
data plot

887
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,079
based on that

888
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,200
draft

889
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,960
supreme sr enhancer data defines how to

890
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,400
reorder

891
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
segmented routine and segment routine or

892
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,320
activate 6 to employment

893
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
boundaries and latency

894
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,920
so this document describes

895
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,119
the pcp is potential for boundary lane

896
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
tennessee parts computation

897
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
it introduces how to transit transmit

898
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,560
the boundary lanterns information

899
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,400
between the pcc and the pce to guarantee

900
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,480
the boundary language transmission in

901
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
control plan

902
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,440
this is the overview of the related

903
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
drafts we have

904
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,599
to enhance that night draft folder data

905
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,400
plan and four drafts for the kingship

906
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,720
plan

907
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,119
this is the summary of the attentions

908
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,160
for the open open open object which the

909
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,960
bounded lantern capability tra is

910
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,800
utility to negotiate the capability of

911
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
bonding lenten say

912
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,320
the br type of trva is extended to the

913
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
rp object to specify the type and the

914
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,480
format of the vri setup pcc desires

915
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,200
we define the traffic model object to

916
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
describe the features of the data data

917
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,040
flow for which the path is to be capable

918
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
calculated

919
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,160
and the bri object is newly defined to

920
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,800
indicate the boundary lanes information

921
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,560
of the condition

922
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,920
parts

923
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
we define the two kinds of full b right

924
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,079
theory

925
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,280
one is the brlister tr we use in the

926
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,240
case when all of them knows in the

927
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,000
erodes sell different bi values and

928
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,440
another is the share the bitr rate your

929
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
server

930
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,119
all of the node

931
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,000
the eo decides the same bri value

932
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,359
the last way you turned the sr policy to

933
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,240
carry brl is a tre and share the vr trv

934
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,520
with the convicted person

935
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,720
uh we defined the abundant language

936
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,280
capability tre to advertise the support

937
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,480
of bounded language features in open

938
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
object it contains the top flag and

939
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,480
format flag to inter

940
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
indicate which kinds of

941
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,520
vr type and format the speakers suppose

942
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,640
another br type of krv is defined for

943
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,560
the rp object overall

944
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,280
when the pcc needed to request the

945
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
abundant history com

946
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,480
computation it must include

947
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,800
the br type query in the rp object in pc

948
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,680
requests a message to specify the type

949
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
and the format of the

950
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,440
bi that pcc desires

951
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
under the traffic model objective is of

952
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,839
h operationally pc requests a message on

953
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720
the user to specify the traffic model

954
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,319
for bonded lantern pass communication

955
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,280
this traffic model object consists

956
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,880
contains a set of fields used to specify

957
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
the traffic features

958
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,680
with basically this traffic features the

959
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,800
pce can calculate the bonded lenders for

960
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
the traffic

961
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,960
and then the result will be a constraint

962
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,520
further pce is a path computation

963
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,200
so

964
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
so how to carry the boundary lantern

965
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,839
surveys are conducted parts

966
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,440
we defined the vr object to indicate the

967
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
requirement and the resource allocation

968
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,480
for the bonding lenders they passed in

969
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,280
the pc reply message

970
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,680
the pita pri object body has a very

971
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
very balanced and many

972
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,960
undermay container trs for different

973
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,000
kinds of

974
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
bri

975
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
where all of the nodes in the

976
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
er requests are different bi to

977
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,800
guarantee bonded lanterns say or br

978
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,839
alice is

979
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,480
defined and

980
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
each

981
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,800
under the officer knows in our request

982
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,680
requests uh the symbol bri to guarantee

983
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
boundary let's say the of vr tra is

984
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,640
defined a shared bra br can be used for

985
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
all of the nodes

986
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,160
when the

987
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,000
conducted path is delivered by sr policy

988
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
the azure policy also needed to carry

989
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,040
the uh saturated bonded lantern

990
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
information

991
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
uh so

992
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,040
all uh

993
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,280
all of the notes in the

994
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,119
uh is this places the path indicated by

995
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,680
the segment list requests a different

996
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,720
api to guarantee bonding lines a

997
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,319
uh a brl is a tre is needed to be

998
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,440
carried

999
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,520
by sr policy

1000
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
and then when all of them knows

1001
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,640
knowledge

1002
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,240
in the

1003
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,680
explicit past indicated by the segment

1004
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,480
list requests of the same bi to

1005
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,560
guarantee boundary length say or share

1006
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,520
the pritra is needed to be carried out

1007
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
with as our policy

1008
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,079
so

1009
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,119
the next step we are welcome to discuss

1010
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,839
our main list another content of the

1011
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,119
structural way of capitalized progress

1012
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,800
in that night

1013
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,839
okay

1014
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,119
thanks for listening

1015
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,400
thank you

1016
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,960
are there any comments

1017
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
uh all the comments which were given for

1018
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,040
the previous presentation i think apply

1019
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,560
to this one

1020
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,279
uh as well

1021
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,200
uh

1022
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,880
and

1023
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,760
one

1024
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,000
example of like why requirements would

1025
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
be very helpful

1026
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,599
uh would be

1027
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,800
like when you were presenting in the uh

1028
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,200
networking group i saw

1029
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,960
that they was mentioning that they could

1030
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
be multiple blis

1031
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,839
uh that would be needed for each hop

1032
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,560
but

1033
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,400
in the current uh

1034
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,000
tlv that we have is like we have one bli

1035
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,640
for one hop so i don't see a case for

1036
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
like you know multiple bli types to be

1037
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,920
included

1038
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
uh so i think like start with the

1039
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,520
requirements so that requirements are

1040
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,400
clear and then we can map them clearly

1041
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,800
to what is how to encode them in pc

1042
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,040
okay secure security

1043
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,720
thank you

1044
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
so i think let's move to the last

1045
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
presentation i don't see any other

1046
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,040
person queuing in

1047
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,079
let me give you slight control

1048
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,839
you should have it okay

1049
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
okay thank you dude

1050
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,119
this is about the gsap extension for an

1051
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,839
rpid

1052
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,800
and first

1053
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,800
uh let's first do quick recant the pct

1054
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,040
constraint draft has been proposed and

1055
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,839
presented during last two years

1056
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,640
it proposed a set of constraints for

1057
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,440
presets with the lateral information

1058
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,640
such as faid color source protocol id

1059
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
multi topology id application id slice

1060
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,760
id and now it it has been replaced or

1061
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,359
merged into four drafts so the current

1062
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,280
printing presenting a draft has replaced

1063
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,960
the t constraints uh and proposed this

1064
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,800
nice related

1065
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,040
concentrate with the

1066
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,079
terminology changing from the slice id

1067
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,880
tlv to nrp idtle

1068
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,200
so

1069
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,440
uh this draft uh

1070
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,960
is mainly about the nrpid as per their

1071
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,599
itfts and as ipm pls rp identifier

1072
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,040
indicates an

1073
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,560
identifier that is globally unique with

1074
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,240
within an rp domain and that can be used

1075
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,880
in the control and management complaint

1076
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
to identify the resources associate

1077
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,200
associated with nrp so this document

1078
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,880
proposes a set of extensions for precept

1079
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,480
to support the identifier of network

1080
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,640
resource party

1081
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,520
partition as the constraint of network

1082
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
slicing during past computation

1083
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,480
so for the uh psap extension we propose

1084
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,720
the lrp trwe it can be used to identify

1085
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,040
the slice and the network resource and

1086
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,599
reviewed as constraints

1087
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,480
network slicing when pc is uh deployed

1088
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,920
the pc may

1089
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,720
maintain network resources per path

1090
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,760
under nrp state within the resource pro

1091
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,480
identified by an rpid so

1092
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,760
the rpi the tree should be carried in

1093
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,520
psalm messages such as uh the pc report

1094
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
message pc leisure message and the pc

1095
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,839
update message

1096
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,760
so the rpi dtre is optional and defined

1097
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,200
to carry the slice specific constraint

1098
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,960
and the definition is the same with the

1099
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,400
rpid as the itft and ns ipnps

1100
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,359
so

1101
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,079
last step uh we also

1102
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,800
thanked the uh suggestions from durf in

1103
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
the mailing list the mrp capability

1104
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,640
would be added in open message in next

1105
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,240
version and we will make clarification

1106
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,960
for the past computation with rpid

1107
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,040
constraint and as add reference to itp

1108
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,599
extensions for nrp as per the lcr spring

1109
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,160
rp draft so

1110
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
comments and discussions are very

1111
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,720
welcome thank you

1112
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,720
uh i see uh jmq go ahead

1113
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,640
hello

1114
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
yeah go ahead we can hear you

1115
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,920
okay

1116
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,559
i i just uh like to mention that uh

1117
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,800
there is a similar draft uh called the

1118
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,720
psap within extensions which covers both

1119
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,640
capability part and the rspa extensions

1120
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,359
and currently there are several set of

1121
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,680
the control plane graphs on the network

1122
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,599
slicing related

1123
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,079
extensions this is just one of them

1124
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,880
including the ijp and the b2p bjprs

1125
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,559
this all the thrust may need to be

1126
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,319
coordinated in the future

1127
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,240
and since we have

1128
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,559
uh some consensus in the tears working

1129
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,240
on the terminology what's in the

1130
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,359
coordination seems uh possible

1131
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,040
and we're open to that

1132
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,079
uh thank you for your comments uh first

1133
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,040
uh

1134
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,640
under as i mentioned just now

1135
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,200
we uh proposed the the draft very early

1136
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,079
and

1137
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,040
uh i think uh second the difference

1138
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,640
between a vpn plus and nrp which is up

1139
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,520
to their teeth working group uh we're

1140
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,119
also very

1141
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,319
glad to discuss with you to progress

1142
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,760
this work

1143
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,280
maybe we could discuss uh offline on

1144
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,480
main list

1145
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,000
or separate celebrate with you

1146
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,760
collab

1147
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,200
maybe we can uh collab uh collaborate uh

1148
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,680
with you uh to progress this piece of

1149
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,558
work thank you

1150
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,559
sounds good thank you

1151
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,480
thank you and that would be my comment

1152
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,880
as well uh i think uh having a single

1153
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
document for the working group to look

1154
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,119
at would always be much easier to

1155
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,359
process and most of the features are

1156
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,800
exactly the same

1157
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
uh open and

1158
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,440
like you know the id inside an sp object

1159
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,640
so i urge the authors to work together

1160
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,760
thank you

1161
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,599
are there any other comments on this

1162
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,839
document or anything else

1163
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,839
otherwise we'll give you back 10 minutes

1164
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,558
i don't see anybody coming to the queue

1165
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,240
julian would you like to close the

1166
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,640
meeting

1167
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,800
yeah sure but thank you everyone for

1168

at

1172
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
various times i don't know drive what

1173
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,760
time it is on your side

1174
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
but

1175

thank you for for being there and thank

1178
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,520
you everyone for contributing let's uh

1179
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
talk on the mailing list and hopefully

1180
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,839
see you face to face in london

1181
