one group status we basically had

125
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,680
a number of milestones which are

126
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
uh passed and for the chicago six fox

127
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,199
and and chicago and the iot

128
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
we are not that bad for the chic over at

129
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
the iot and the chicago kind of was kind

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
of delayed because of the need to

131
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
to generate the compound act separately

132
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
but uh we're getting there for for

133
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
all our documents so we are not that bad

134
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,639
actually being on new year off is not

135
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
that bad

136
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
now we still have sorry no

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
well we pushed it to the end of the year

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
but we will see if there is still

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
interest in this group to produce it

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
some basically flying object networks uh

175
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
we have uh ppp over ethernet so we can

176
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
do ppp so we can do ppp over anything

177
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,639
including ethernet and wi-fi uh we've

178
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
got the work that kelly's has started

179
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
for 15 15-4 15-4 was initially chartered

180
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
but mostly as a wide area

181
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
uh

182
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
low-power wide area network like 15-4 in

183
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
g basically in this type of networks

184
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
using subject but now we are looking at

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
15 4

186
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
uh 2.4 gig you know for for

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
we pan or even

188
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
body area network 56 etc

189
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
so so basically doing what six low has

190
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
done with six four six lowpan

191
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
generalizing to other technology see

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
what we can do

193
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
and then look at other things we could

194
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
be doing with shakes so chic at the

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
moment does compression

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
it also that's fragmentation

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,519
uh it has reliable fragmentation but as

198
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
bob hinted it doesn't affect for

199
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
instance

200
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
to do reliable

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,760
uh reliability but not with

202
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
arq really forward reliability which

203
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
would save the return channel so looking

204
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
at things like that could be of interest

205
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
um and then there is bob's proposal for

206
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
the chic next header which is also not

207
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
in the charter so basically looking at

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
how we expand chic

209
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
for

210
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
other spaces larger spaces could be of

211
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
interest for this group and they would

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
like to take the sense of the room and

213
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,959
then sense of the working group if

214
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
people are interested in pursuing the

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,680
work in those direct directions

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
and with this we'll move with the first

217
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
edge of the item and i think that's anna

218
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,440
hello do you hear me

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
yes i hear you

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
uh thank you very much so i will present

221
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,800
the the last version of the cheek of our

222
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
nbiot draft

223
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
we published

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,079
on july next slide please

225
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,120
you can i give you the control

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
okay sorry

227
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
okay

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,920
so

229
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
we

230
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,079
we have made in this version 10 the

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
the inputs from the

232
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
review of pascal thank you pascal

233
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,839
principally the references were

234
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,720
arranged informative and normative

235
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
we also

236
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,720
updated the cross-reference with the

237
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
sections

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
most of needs

239
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,700
about

240
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,160
[Music]

241
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
the reference because it was very

242
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
difficult to design it with the new

243
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
xml version 3

244
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
the 3gpp

245
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
references it was a little bit

246
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
complicated

247
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,000
so one one thing that we can

248
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
we can say of this draft is that more of

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,279
the features are

250
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,959
recommendations for 3gpp

251
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,440
in order to use

252
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
chic

253
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,279
for

254
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
for the

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
nba ut network

256
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,760
so

257
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,640
one of the comment of pascal was

258
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
if we need to

259
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
uh define

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,279
an mtu size of

261
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,399
1358 bytes

262
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
so um

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
the thing is that we are recommended to

264
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,760
use this mtu even if the 3gpp networks

265
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
accept larger

266
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
larger sizes of 1

267
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,320
1600 so it's enough for a normal ip

268
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
packet

269
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
but in this case you will have a

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,560
segmentation in layer two

271
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,360
so the to avoid that we

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,279
recommend to use a smaller mtu for

273
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,480
for nb iot in order to

274
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
avoid using the

275
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,040
rlc segmentation but that doesn't limit

276
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,519
the use of bigger mtu in the network

277
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
so

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
the other comment was about

279
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,439
the different

280
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
stack we have in the

281
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
in the draft so again we

282
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
we have divided the draft in three users

283
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,480
cases

284
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
the first one is the use of cheek in the

285
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
radio link

286
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
where we have the ip

287
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
pdc plc mac

288
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,839
stack

289
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
chic is

290
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
included in the pdcp layer

291
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
and in this stack you have a

292
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
segmentation in rlc

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
so most of the fragmentation

294
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
we decide not to use it we only use the

295
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
the compression of chic

296
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
except for the transparent mode where

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
there is no uh

298
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
segmentation in rsc

299
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
and then we decide to

300
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
recommend the use of

301
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,079
chick fragmentation

302
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
the other use is in the north

303
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
access stratum in donas where you have

304
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
the ip packet over the rrc rlc mac

305
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,560
so there

306
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
chic will be using the error c layer

307
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
and again you have the segmentation in

308
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,360
rlc so we are using only compression but

309
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
not fragmentation

310
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
and in the last case you have an

311
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,720
end-to-end

312
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,279
connection you have ip over cheek over

313
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,240
mac

314
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
and and that's in that case we recommend

315
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
to use chic compression and

316
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
fragmentation

317
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
so that was the two

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,800
more elevated technical point of the

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,519
review the last review

320
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,360
so if you have questions

321
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,360
this draft has been sent to the isg

322
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,519
for publication

323
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
many thanks anna

324
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
uh do we have any question in the room

325
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
i'm not trying to jump into the queue

326
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
sorry just to tell you that

327
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
next step is an idea review by myself

328
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
but i'm buzzing this week as you can

329
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
guess right so don't expect anything

330
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
moving before mid august most roughly

331
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
okay

332
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,959
thank you eric thank you

333
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,839
okay pascal can you take control during

334
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
my presentation

335
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,720
okay i will do that

336
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,800
if i

337
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
can

338
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
okay so i took the control away from you

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
now i need to share

340
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,839
this slide

341
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,759
[Music]

342
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,000
okay

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,120
yes

344
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,199
go ahead okay so

345
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,399
this is the

346
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
14th version of the young data model

347
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,160
so i think we are converging right now

348
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,320
and we have something that is quite

349
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
quite nice so next slide please

350
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
so i just remember what is what covers

351
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
this young data model so the

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
the version currently is the 11

353
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
of july and it covers only what is

354
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
defined in published rfcs it's 87 24 and

355
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
88 24 so it cover compression

356
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,839
fragmentation

357
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
and no compression for ipv6 to dp and

358
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,639
co-op underscore

359
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
so it defines

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,360
the rules and also the parameters that

361
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,399
we use

362
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
in for these actions

363
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,759
so what we have done and what is one of

364
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,279
the main change since the previous

365
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
version is that the timer values and i

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
will explain in the next slide

367
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
so next slide please

368
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,519
so we we are here all the modification

369
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
we have done in in the model

370
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,399
until this version 14. so the first one

371
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
was to clarify the old one

372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
because it could have an ambiguity

373
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
because you have a l on the one that are

374
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,560
very similar and of course we cannot

375
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
change the standard so we put a dash

376
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
between all and one

377
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
and we also change

378
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
in

379
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for the value for the target value and

380
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
parameters we change the name position

381
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
that could be ambiguous

382
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
with the field position we have in other

383
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,559
places and we call it an index now

384
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,919
and the main change is in the way we

385
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
manage timer before it was uh you win

386
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
uint 64

387
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,919
and which engine is something that is

388
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,359
more flexible

389
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,000
and if you can go to the next slide we

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
we use so a thick duration

391
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
and a tick number so the tick duration

392
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
is a formula where you have two power

393
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,720
arctic duration divided by 10 power six

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
that give us

395
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
when the fix duration is zero a unit of

396
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
one microsecond

397
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
and if you increase the tick duration

398
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
you increase this unit and for example

399
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
when you put the value 20 then you have

400
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
about one second for extinct duration

401
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
so then

402
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
to set up a timer we just give

403
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
the number of ticks we we want or six

404
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,799
number

405
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
and this way we can cover different

406
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,760
range and different usage for chic

407
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,120
one can be up to the micro second so it

408
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,080
could be useful for real time and we can

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
go if we increase the

410
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
the tigration to several years a lot of

411
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
years even to uh for for the timer so

412
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
what we choose to use as a default value

413
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,799
is 20

414
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,559
because we have a tick of about one

415
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,440
second

416
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,120
and the maximum timer is 19 hours

417
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
and the row

418
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
one recommendation

419
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
is about 12 hours so we have something

420
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,360
that fits well the needs for lc1

421
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,840
so next slide please

422
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
so we got also

423
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
a review

424
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
at a young doctor's review of the model

425
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
so thank you for martin thompson and

426
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
john clark

427
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
we got a very very nice review that

428
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,200
makes

429
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
improving the document so i will not go

430
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
into all the details if i have done that

431
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
on on the mailing list

432
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
but

433
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
if there is a major issue on

434
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
the nature of the road so right now in

435
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
the model we are just a choice

436
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,000
for

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,360
fragmentation

438
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
compression and low compression

439
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
and this choice is not exclusive it

440
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
means that the device can

441
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,440
with a young model you can select both

442
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
compression and fragmentation so that's

443
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
not what we need because in the in a

444
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,880
chic

445
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
a rule can be ever fragmentation or

446
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
compression but not at the same time

447
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
both so that's why i i propose a change

448
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
so we have to discuss uh on that on

449
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
on the mailing list so let's next slide

450
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,120
please

451
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
is to add a new leaf

452
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
that is a rule nature and this rule

453
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
nature will tell if is

454
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,679
a compression or a fragmentation rule

455
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
and inside each

456
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
definition of the compression content

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
and the fragmentation content we make a

458
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
test to see if we follow we are on the

459
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,159
right nature

460
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,320
and we don't need anymore no cooperation

461
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
as a choice because it was ineffective

462
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
and it will not have been

463
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,480
rich at any at any time

464
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
so that's a

465
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,840
significant modification we made from

466
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
the model and it will be published in

467
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
with the new version of the of the drive

468
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
so next time

469
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,400
so

470
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
just to

471
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
to conclude on it something that

472
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
came when we had to write the security

473
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,159
review or security chapter is that uh

474
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,840
right now the young data model we are

475
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
using is just respecting

476
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
what is saying the rfc

477
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,799
and it's a way to have something a

478
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
command between a device

479
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
a core or a chic

480
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
upper chick

481
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
and maybe your repository when we will

482
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
have the roof

483
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
but until now we don't

484
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
you we don't identify the device and

485
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
it's something that is

486
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,120
very important and we need to have this

487
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,200
in the architecture graph so next slide

488
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
this

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
to identify the

490
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
the device

491
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,720
so we we have i think to work on that

492
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
part so how we do the

493
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
uh notification

494
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
for example in openshift we have two

495
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,159
kind of devices we have the ones that

496
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
are directly connected to internet just

497
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
for tests where we have an ipr ip

498
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,159
address in the device and we have the

499
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
lower one where we have the dev ui at vm

500
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,919
so this is one way to represent it in

501
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
openshift we have also other documents

502
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
like the rfc 1999 39 that define a url

503
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
for

504
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
this device so

505
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
we have to see if it's convenient

506
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
with a compact representation because

507
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
this is urn and they are in a ski so

508
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,440
there is other work at

509
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
the atf to to compress url and urn so

510
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,200
maybe we can use it or maybe also use

511
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,320
the arcade a compact notification

512
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
in the young model so that's one thing

513
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,080
that would be important to to define

514
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
and the last point is that when we will

515
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,840
have these ids

516
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
then we can

517
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,640
add

518
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,039
this id to the young model with young

519
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
data model we have defined and for

520
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,679
example if we don't put ids it could be

521
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
it could fit a point-to-point model

522
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,440
if we just put the device id we are in

523
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,480
as we are right now in the star topology

524
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
and if we put the device on the core

525
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,919
then we can reach the constraints from

526
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,120
mesh network

527
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
so that's some evolution we will have to

528
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
to discuss

529
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
and we need

530
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,799
also some words for the security section

531
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,600
about

532
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
these things because of course if we

533
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,840
don't have identification that anybody

534
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,200
can modify

535
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
a young data model and it's something

536
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
that could be

537
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,159
insecure

538
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,880
so i think it's my last slide

539
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,679
if you have questions

540
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
thank you very much loho and we'll be

541
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
moving to

542
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
um sergio so sergio

543
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,799
can you jump to the mic

544
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,000
yes hello can you hear me

545
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,240
yes this is great so please go ahead

546
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
hello i will present a compound graph in

547
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
this case the path to publication

548
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,440
uh can you put the next slide please

549
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
i give you the control if you

550
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,000
how do i

551
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
there you go well one of the biggest

552
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,440
changes that we did on version five uh

553
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
was that we changed the the way padding

554
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
bits are handled before we said that

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,440
padding bits must be zero

556
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
according to the the review with

557
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,440
dominique and the spirit of the rfc 8724

558
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
that it has no padding bits defined the

559
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
idea was to to not

560
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
specifically define the padding bits

561
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
but we needed a way to actually

562
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,520
differentiate the the last window from

563
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
from extra bits so we decided that we

564
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,679
will use m bits as zero that can be used

565
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
when you need to add more than inputting

566
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,720
bits to

567
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,640
the message this way you

568
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,600
this mbit signal the end of the compound

569
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,799
other changes were more specifically

570
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
format we remove any reference to the

571
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,440
receiver award we also

572
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,919
re remove any bound

573
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,640
of that qi compound act to hack on error

574
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,880
this was removed in introduction and in

575
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,400
many other areas

576
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
and also we provided compressed bitmap

577
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
examples on how to use a compound with

578
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
with compressed bitmap

579
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
another big change that we did actually

580
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
was that we added the complete section

581
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,000
of the rfc 8724 section

582
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,520
eight four three

583
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
the aqua nero mode with all the changes

584
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
on how to use the compound knack

585
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,039
actually it was difficult to to read

586
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,360
where the specific changes had to be

587
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,159
done

588
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
so in this case we added a new text all

589
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,960
text to the complete section

590
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,279
and these ways we believe it's more

591
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,159
clear to to read and actually know where

592
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,480
the differences between the compound and

593
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
the rfc 8724

594
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,600
also the we define the the compound as

595
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,799
compatible

596
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,120
in this sense we we specified that the

597
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,480
rfc that jack on the rfc8724 is a

598
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,039
special case of the of the compound

599
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
in the case with one window of tiles

600
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,640
and finally well we need to define the

601
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
next steps on on this draft and we would

602
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,679
like to thank also dominique for all the

603
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
uh for the review and all the on all the

604
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
work that he has done thank you very

605
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
much

606
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,960
any questions in the room nobody jumps

607
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,200
so yeah let's move on

608
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,559
if you don't mind putting the other

609
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
slides

610
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,240
let's move on to the to move on to the

611
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
shake classic fox

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
okay

613
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,159
okay

614
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,039
you how many controls are you

615
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,120
okay well this is the status of the

616
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,440
cheek over over sick fox draft

617
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,200
in this case we would like to thank anna

618
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
for the schaefer review and these are

619
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,440
the main changes in version 11.

620
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
we did some changes in the introduction

621
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,000
in abstract we did some changes

622
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
regarding the

623
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
the acronyms

624
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,400
we also changed some terms about the

625
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
predictability of data flows to traffic

626
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
flows to be more according to

627
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,039
to

628
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,600
rxc8724

629
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,480
we added some legends in figure one to

630
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
to actually understand what what its

631
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,760
symbol stands for

632
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
uh also we stated that confirmed that we

633
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,480
confirmed with appendix f we added some

634
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
new text that is actually well

635
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,799
in this case that we recommend a message

636
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,840
to be sent it's 24 hours to enable the

637
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,960
downlink

638
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,600
transmission

639
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
uh also well we changed some terminology

640
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,279
of how we we

641
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,440
it was written the draft

642
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
uh also well we added some information

643
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
about the ups and down link messages how

644
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
the downlink is enabled in sigfox

645
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
and well this is a topic that maybe we

646
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,880
can discuss at the end uh regarding the

647
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,039
detect and the rule id

648
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,039
we added the information regarding the

649
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,080
the

650
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
that we believe that with this amount of

651
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
rules like this is enough for

652
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
for the purpose of identifying different

653
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,679
flows in the in

654
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,360
the transmission

655
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
uh also we added some recommended values

656
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,679
for inactivity timer and retransmission

657
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,080
timers

658
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
and fine this is

659
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
yes and another question was regarding

660
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,559
the

661
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,840
rcs

662
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,080
in this case this was also presented in

663
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,559
that ietf we changed how the rfc is

664
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,279
calculated actually what we send is just

665
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,640
the number of

666
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,799
of tiles of the last window

667
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,120
and and that way we are able to recover

668
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,039
to know how many fragments are lost in

669
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,480
the last window and we are able to

670
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
reconstruct that the message

671
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
as the

672
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,399
crc is already checking layer two of the

673
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,640
sig folks fragment

674
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,080
so i think this is the the final one

675
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
thank you very much if anyone has any

676
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,840
questions

677
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
this was great sergio thank you very

678
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,640
much very informative and and you you

679
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
maintained within the

680
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,399
window shop window that you had

681
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,120
so just one last comment i have the a

682
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
new version of both drafts to be

683
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,799
uploaded uh with the needs both i i

684
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,520
correct the needs in both and i fixed

685
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
the last email of anna from the mailing

686
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,159
list thanks to anna again so we did that

687
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:38,960
last

688
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,279
changes so the drafts are

689
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,080
all really really

690
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
ready i would say

691
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
at this point

692
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
yes so the the shepherd as people

693
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
guessed the shepherd for the first

694
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,360
document is uh i likes actually and the

695
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
second is anna so that's why you got the

696
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,159
the reviews for now and i guess you will

697
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
get the review from alex the shepherd

698
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,960
review from alex very soon uh

699
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
that mentioned in but alexander could

700
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,080
not be with us today so it's very sad

701
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,200
but um

702
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,279
yes we will do without him

703
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,000
um and now yes please move

704
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,679
and now yes

705
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,880
i have a question about do we need to

706
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
to wait on the compound act has been

707
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,720
uh published to publish six folks or we

708
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
are going to send it both at the same

709
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,200
time

710
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,080
oh because

711
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
you can press the button

712
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,960
maybe eric wants to speak but you can

713
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
press the button eric will know that he

714
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,279
gets he expects both documents

715
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,039
and anyway the ietf will publish them at

716
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,520
the same time because of the dependency

717
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,480
so even if the the shakeover sick fox

718
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
progresses faster

719
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,399
since it has this normative dependency

720
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
it will have to to wait

721
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,320
uh in miss raf at the rfc did our queue

722
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
but it won't be long because the two of

723
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,760
them will be posted you know almost

724
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
simultaneously

725
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,799
okay

726
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
so just to be clear i will be publishing

727
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
new versions of the draft today or

728
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,919
tomorrow

729
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
to to be considered in any further

730
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,159
review

731
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,640
okay well expect the shepherd review by

732
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
alexander very soon

733
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,840
and once anna is ready and you have

734
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,200
answered all the questions you know

735
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
about ipr etc i will press the button

736
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
requesting for publication

737
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,919
so eric knows that something is coming

738
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,840
thank you very much

739
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
we need to move to bob otherwise we

740
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,240
would start being late which would be

741
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,960
which would be very bad after the

742
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,120
excellent timing you made sergio

743
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
so bob yes

744
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,480
and bob is in the room i guess

745
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,950
[Music]

746
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,159
bob i will ask you to speak near the mic

747
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,279
and and stay very young

748
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,640
and hold the mic

749
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
and let me go

750
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,519
okay this presentation is of i as ip pro

751
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
card number for sheik

752
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
and this did not come out of my work on

753
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
forward error correction which i did in

754
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
in raw so please go to the next slide

755
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
i'll say why i'm doing this

756
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
and networks are complex and one of

757
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
constrain links is within the path

758
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,440
there's end points no know the

759
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,240
constraint but have no control over it

760
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,159
this is an avionics on an ethernet on

761
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,320
the plane and knows it's got a control

762
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,039
link going to a data center somewhere in

763
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
the on on on the internet and and those

764
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
that definitely gets there but cannot

765
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
interact with it directly

766
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,880
all ip content is with a non-compressed

767
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,000
security wrapper there's that as well

768
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,919
example this

769
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,559
guide esp wants to compress a security

770
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,679
wrapper but how to flag this i'll then

771
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,760
do a special spy which is how the draft

772
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
is right now

773
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
um dtls

774
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,000
much of the udp can be derived from dtls

775
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
why do i have to carry udp when i

776
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,880
compress that down as well

777
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,760
so

778
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,880
these are two examples of how if i had

779
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,519
sheet as my header

780
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,679
i can do things

781
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,880
so if ipv6 next header worksheet

782
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
the rules can't compress the transport

783
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
and all up to the security envelope

784
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,919
can even indicate what rules for within

785
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,600
the security envelope

786
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,360
um can also as also end to end

787
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
so i gained some

788
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,039
additional controls in an antenna

789
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,679
environment if i were to have sheik

790
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,840
saying that this payload is to shake

791
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,559
apply the rules

792
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,439
can you

793
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,679
effectively when you do this sheet

794
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,480
becomes the transport layer

795
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
to transmit the original um transport

796
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
layer compress

797
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,919
no why have udp crc when i have the the

798
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,480
icv in uh in dtls or esp why do i have

799
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
to also carry the crc as well squeeze it

800
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,320
out and then rebuild it um provide new

801
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,839
and then provide new and valuable

802
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,918
transfer functions like an end to end

803
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,839
forward error correction which i

804
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,078
presented earlier uh presentation

805
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,879
so can

806
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,719
so this is the the how here's my

807
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,079
technical slide have to have one

808
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,440
technical slide

809
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,679
um

810
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
it review the current protocol numbers i

811
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
went through them there's nothing that i

812
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,359
could camp on to do this now is there

813
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,760
any protocol number i can use no i can't

814
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,440
i need one so we have a chic protocol

815
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,399
payload a rule id could be zero bytes so

816
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,560
basically you have your your rule i you

817
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,440
have the the chic is your your your

818
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
protocol id you have the rule id the

819
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
compression residue and then whatever

820
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,720
payload you have it standard stuff you

821
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
people have been created as you know

822
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,040
okay

823
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
but can we really introduce a new ipv6

824
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,640
next better value

825
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,359
will it just work or do we need router

826
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,560
upgrades

827
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,160
um

828
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,079
what would happen will the routers be

829
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,880
dropping oh i don't know this this uh ip

830
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,680
uh protocol number drop it that that's a

831
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
six-man question um what might i p

832
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
fragmentation resulted

833
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,560
um do we need to force don't fragment

834
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,200
because with what what is being done you

835
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,359
no longer have a transport blank and now

836
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,960
you have that so these are questions

837
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,760
need to be answered what else could go

838
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,720
wrong

839
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,960
happen existing not fused value really

840
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,119
bad idea

841
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,640
quickly bob clarification questions

842
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,400
the idea for this one

843
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,640
happy fragmentation there is no don't

844
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,280
fragment bit in ipv6 there's the source

845
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
doing it

846
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
so by default all the pv6 packets safe

847
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,000
do not fragment

848
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
just there good

849
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,599
i've not been paying close enough

850
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,320
attention thank you for that

851
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,079
clarification eric go on

852
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
um is this a field of dreams isn't what

853
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
the internet is about though

854
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
let's just do it adopt it as a work

855
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,320
group item

856
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,400
get this additional functionality for

857
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,320
those of us who want to use it and to

858
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,640
end take advantage of all the good work

859
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
you have done one of the other things i

860
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,920
realize again looking at diet esp and

861
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,880
i'm doing a tunnel inside so once i have

862
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,880
chic as iv protocol number i have seek

863
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
and and the secret says this is esp

864
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
here's our process header and in the esp

865
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
the next header is chic again

866
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,400
for how long press that that uh esp

867
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,480
payload inside of there so actually i

868
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
end up then using sheet twice in that

869
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
case and it just flows in the stack and

870
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,200
we don't have and we

871
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,280
limit how much special stuff we have to

872
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,160
do

873
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,720
so it's a way in my opinion and i ask

874
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
that this be adopted by the work of this

875
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,640
idea and uh

876
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
i don't think we need much of a document

877
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,359
to accomplish it

878
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
any questions

879
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
effectively there are no there are two

880
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,359
people in the queue i happen to be first

881
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,240
so if you don't mind uh can you go back

882
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
a few slides when you talk about

883
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
uh the transport and and the discussion

884
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
about fragmentation not fragmentation

885
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,480
but fact basically

886
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
so you you mentioned that you presented

887
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
that at the raw

888
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,240
working group and effectively that's

889
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,079
something which relates to to the

890
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,720
potential need for uh rechartering which

891
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,119
will come later

892
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
my question to you is as you know we

893
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,839
have a reactive arq type of reliability

894
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,599
for the fragment

895
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,359
in check

896
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
what we don't have is a

897
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,160
fak variation

898
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,800
for the fragment reliability

899
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
and

900
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
as you know the lp1 networks are usually

901
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
very asymmetrical like the device can

902
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,560
sound but the gateway don't have much

903
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,920
bandwidth back

904
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,040
so having to send the axe is the pain

905
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,640
and it could be envisioned that

906
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,839
effectively

907
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,200
fake

908
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,280
uh for chic fragments

909
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
could be a a new

910
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
possibility for

911
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
a sheikh right an alternate

912
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
fragmentation technique which seems to

913
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,000
fit exactly what the kind of thing that

914
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you've been discussing so

915
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,760
please consider that and and come back

916
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,480
to us you know if you want some work to

917
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,800
to start here knowing that the transport

918
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
guys will have to tell you how you do

919
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,599
the

920
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,560
um

921
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,320
the the coding or something it cannot

922
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
come from us but maybe the fact that we

923
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
are using the coding the recommend could

924
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,680
be a work here if we were shouted for it

925
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,839
sorry for the

926
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,160
loan i'm a little bit too old and i

927
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,960
dealt too much with ipv4 uh ip level

928
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
fragmentation starts with oh my god i'm

929
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,560
doing this and here comes ipv6 breaks my

930
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,480
packet up and then things don't working

931
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,560
and eric just correct we know ipv6 does

932
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,119
not fragment and we're okay there so my

933
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,119
concern was not what would we do inside

934
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,040
of secret fragmentation but what

935
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
happened below us and it's clarified i

936
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,359
don't have to worry about that so so yes

937
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,200
if we need the fragment case for

938
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
whatever and we have it now so we can

939
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,720
use the sheet fragmentation

940
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,079
appropriately

941
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,920
yeah because we we fragment so you can

942
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
we can take your packet cut it into

943
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,720
call that two fragment and then sell two

944
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,680
tiles and send the third tile as being

945
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,560
the fact and it's all within our global

946
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,920
design and then if you have raw

947
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,520
something that can be distributed over

948
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
multiple paths and you don't even have

949
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
to know about that

950
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,920
so so there's a way to build something

951
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,000
really nice

952
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,599
very good okay

953
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,520
thank you pascal

954
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,760
eric so eric link the entity

955
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,079
gaston has posed a couple of comments

956
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
into the chat so bob i really advise you

957
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,520
to read them that's about other

958
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
compression techniques that could be

959
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,079
used now regarding this i agree with the

960
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,240
idea right don't take me wrong

961
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,119
i think it would be better to pause this

962
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,440
draft in interior

963
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,040
because for this here you'll need

964
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
recharging you're asking for an ip

965
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,400
protocol number

966
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
i need to reread the chart of interior

967
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,200
but i think it fits much better

968
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,720
and it's

969
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
like what's the hope for this and so

970
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,880
forth and and

971
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,319
and they said the effects should be in

972
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,079
transport but i just quickly during the

973
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,319
lunch i reviewed the traffic framework

974
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,680
and that's all really in in streaming of

975
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,920
applications and not what i wanted to do

976
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
it so it's interesting work that can be

977
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,680
applied but what i'm trying to do it has

978
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
really nothing to do with what they did

979
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,000
so i can leverage off what they did so

980
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
um it's uh

981
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,200
looking for no where does this property

982
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
belong i strongly believe it's worth

983
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,839
doing and i do need it

984
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
so let's

985
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
get it moving in and get it going that's

986
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
what i'd like to see so in area eric

987
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,359
still working with you

988
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,920
yes at least we can express support and

989
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,359
i would be the first one to express

990
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,720
support because i really like the

991
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,400
opportunities that you're creating doing

992
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
this

993
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,480
but yes we'll see what interior says

994
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
um and then again you might think that

995
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,119
instead of producing the ipe thing in

996
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,800
here you could produce an ergonomic

997
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,359
fragmentation which is effectively

998
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,839
within quarter for us

999
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,240
but we we could

1000
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,319
maybe extend i don't know

1001
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,000
maybe to change a little bit the charter

1002
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,680
for different things but

1003
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,560
this

1004
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,640
is there any other question

1005
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,880
any kind of feeling about the idea

1006
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
whether it's a good idea about idea in

1007
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,880
the room

1008
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,040
head nods going on

1009
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,359
i'll just say one of the things that

1010
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,680
you know what i will i will use the uns

1011
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,660
tool

1012
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,000
[Music]

1013
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,160
so really clean up dot dye and esp as

1014
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,920
well make the ideas be much easier

1015
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,119
so we're going to do a hand raise or

1016
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,079
i think

1017
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,119
something real cool

1018
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,760
so i've started a session asking whether

1019
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,800
you you think it's a good idea

1020
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,960
please go to your application the light

1021
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
weight in the room and the normal

1022
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,920
you should see the the polls starting

1023
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,599
and i'll give you a few more

1024
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,640
okay so

1025
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,240
in a very quick time we got 10 positive

1026
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,760
zero negative

1027
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,079
so at least you can go to the interior

1028
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,400
saying that the lp1

1029
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
working group

1030
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,040
in the room

1031
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,160
was

1032
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,839
very positive

1033
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,799
with the idea that you're proposing

1034
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
okay i guess that's it thank you for

1035
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,520
your time and thank you for your backing

1036
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
and and i will be working on this

1037
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,560
because i do need it

1038
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,960
neat thanks so much bob and thanks think

1039
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,720
about the other part how it could be

1040
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
accommodated within the shake

1041
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,599
fragmentation framework

1042
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,440
so that i mean i'm sure people in this

1043
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,599
room would would be glad to to chat with

1044
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,760
you on this

1045
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,839
uh oh no i already loaded them because i

1046
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,280
could have done that so now you need to

1047
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,680
hand me the

1048
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,400
[Music]

1049
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,280
please

1050
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
hand me the ball

1051
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,960
okay well just let me let let me know

1052
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,680
damn this could be faster

1053
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,560
so chic architecture

1054
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
okay so

1055
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,480
you know it was a long time uh a request

1056
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,240
pushing us to to update the chic

1057
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
architecture and we we basically were

1058
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,119
like hey um chicken architecture kind of

1059
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,400
documents

1060
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,960
steps that the the working group is

1061
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
taking and and the agreements that we

1062
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,000
are reaching

1063
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
the mailing list and since you know

1064
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,760
there was nothing much new to to be

1065
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
discussed

1066
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,480
the architecture was not progressing but

1067
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,280
then

1068
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,160
thanks to carlos for a large part we

1069
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,040
we

1070
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,440
realized number of gaps that needed to

1071
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
be discussed in particular

1072
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,760
as you extend help

1073
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,440
everyone shake to other

1074
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,560
areas than the traditional

1075
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,760
looper device to gateway type

1076
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,079
then a number of things which are like

1077
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,599
kind of implicit

1078
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,040
or obvious

1079
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,599
in sick fox or laura

1080
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,359
became unknown when you are doing

1081
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,720
peer-to-peer

1082
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,440
we we we need a role of a device we need

1083
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,400
the role

1084
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,160
of a

1085
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,000
application and we need

1086
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,400
we need a direction uplink downlink uh

1087
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,880
and you know from from uplink from the

1088
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,480
device to the app basically because the

1089
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,520
compression depends on those information

1090
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,440
and guess what uh when you're going

1091
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
peer-to-peer or forwarding

1092
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,040
on a more symmetrical network then the

1093
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,000
implicit once the app on the device goes

1094
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,040
away and we have to define that

1095
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,720
and the other thing and that's one thing

1096
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,800
that that bob has to think about was my

1097
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,960
comment in his initial discussion for

1098
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,839
the

1099
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,359
ip

1100
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,520
next header

1101
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,400
that was the the fact that

1102
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,760
chic

1103
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,359
lives on a point to point

1104
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,480
connection

1105
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,440
of some form a session i mean the way

1106
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,560
you want but

1107
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,880
for for lauren sickfox there's just one

1108
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,560
communication between the app and the

1109
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,400
gateway so there are not two so

1110
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,079
implicitly the sheik instance is known

1111
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,520
but

1112
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,240
if you talk over ip i mean this device

1113
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,079
could have multiple sessions with that

1114
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,440
other device

1115
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,760
and so finding which check instance you

1116
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,640
know this packet is for becomes harder

1117
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,480
and we need to we need to signal it some

1118
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,359
way

1119
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,000
now we realize that most use cases that

1120
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
we have

1121
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
um the sheik instance lives on a

1122
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,760
connection or a session of some sort you

1123
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,599
could establish a tcp session you could

1124
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,760
establish a udp

1125
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,560
session like in the ppp draft but there

1126
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,000
is something underneath there is a

1127
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
peer-to-peer security tunnel and there

1128
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,599
is something

1129
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,880
and so

1130
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,520
basically if the rule is when you open a

1131
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
communication pipe between two devices

1132
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,640
and

1133
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
well there can be only one shake

1134
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,119
instance over that particular type and

1135
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,800
so you don't have to

1136
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,440
modify shake to signal the instance it's

1137
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
basically because

1138
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,119
it's it's derived from the pipe that

1139
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,920
supports that particular communication

1140
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,079
so with this we can leave shake as it is

1141
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,760
and basically derive the instance from

1142
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,319
the lower layer from from the

1143
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,640
the communication pipe that contains

1144
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,400
this this instance

1145
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,720
once we have this instance we can say

1146
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,000
hey well if it's unclear

1147
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,680
who should be app who should be device

1148
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,160
then the device is the one that started

1149
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,760
the connection for instance if it's

1150
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,240
about tcp then the device that send the

1151
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,319
tcp scene would be

1152
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,160
would be the the the

1153
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,200
the device and you know the synap comes

1154
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
from the the server so our playing case

1155
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,079
is along the path of the tcp scene

1156
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,760
basically just to give you an example we

1157
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,440
don't have shake about tcp as far as i

1158
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,319
know but it could it could happen

1159
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,920
so with this we've sorted out you know

1160
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
the unknown that garland has raised in

1161
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,359
his 82.15 for work and actually uh he is

1162
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,680
updating his documents to reflect this

1163
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,040
so all these were architecture

1164
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,119
considerations and then we have produced

1165
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,920
new text to document this there are

1166
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,079
there are cases like bluetooth energy

1167
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,319
where there is a hub and spokes

1168
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,720
and so for those ones we do just like we

1169
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,319
do with gateway and

1170
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,880
devices i mean the hub is cotton called

1171
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,640
the gateway and the spoke

1172
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,839
is is

1173
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,680
the device side

1174
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
so for those ones it's kind of easy but

1175
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,800
for really peer-to-peer like i over ip

1176
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,280
something it we have to have a session

1177
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,680
of some sort a connection of some sort

1178
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,760
so we can identify the

1179
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,880
instance now what's next

1180
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,000
well

1181
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,079
there are number of things that have

1182
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,960
been tried outside could have been done

1183
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,240
here

1184
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,359
uh and an example of that is chicago we

1185
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,520
have fun since the draft for chicago ppp

1186
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,240
we propose to the interior and i don't

1187
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,200
want to

1188
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,280
to send bad waves you know in bob's

1189
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,720
direction but we

1190
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,760
we held that draft for a number of iatfs

1191
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,480
with no review no commands no interest

1192
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,880
from interior and so the only way to

1193
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,559
progress that document is probably to

1194
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,079
bring it back to sheikh but we are not

1195
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,599
chartered for

1196
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,920
221 but we are not chartered for shikkov

1197
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,599
fool when foo is not one of the

1198
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,880
technologies

1199
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
so extending to new technologies could

1200
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
be one thing that we could consider as a

1201
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,839
recharger and that would enable us to

1202
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,240
effectively discuss scala's case with 15

1203
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,119
4

1204
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,240
uh that would enable to discuss ppp and

1205
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,400
any other type of link

1206
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,880
um now there was that the

1207
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
the chic n

1208
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,000
the next letter for sheikh that bob has

1209
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,240
been talking about so i understand that

1210
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,520
uh eric suggests to move it to

1211
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,240
to interior at the same time today bob

1212
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,760
proposed a throw

1213
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,559
uh

1214
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,400
nigeria to do network coding between

1215
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,359
fragments i mean that idea is not

1216
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,640
new right but doing it inside chick

1217
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,119
would be quite nice because even for

1218
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,960
traditional lp ones i mean you would

1219
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,160
save

1220
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,319
the uh the retries

1221
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,480
that we have for the for the fragments

1222
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,280
because we have some homophobia

1223
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,200
in the reliable fragments that we could

1224
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,839
make fragments not fully reliable but

1225
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,079
a lot more reliable by doing fake the

1226
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,119
way

1227
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,559
bob presented it

1228
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,880
i not sure this requires a recharge ring

1229
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,559
that's something we can check but

1230
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,200
basically this kind of fighters

1231
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,800
also something that could impact our

1232
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,079
charter so uh what i wanted to do today

1233
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,240
is not really propose your chart of text

1234
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,359
or what but uh basically figure if you

1235
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,839
know the usual suspects in the room

1236
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,920
um are willing to to look at more

1237
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,319
things which we could do in these groups

1238
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,400
which are not the current charter and

1239
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,640
discuss that about the mailing list and

1240
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,280
just to sense interest i will

1241
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,079
um i will send a poll to the main two to

1242
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,480
the group

1243
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,359
[Music]

1244
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,040
so are you interested in taking new work

1245
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,400
slash rechartering

1246
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,940
and i'm starting the

1247
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,079
[Music]

1248
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,000
session one yes one no oh that doesn't

1249
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,200
help

1250
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,920
two yes fistping please say something

1251
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,400
new work being possibly cheek over fool

1252
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,480
right shakeover non

1253
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,040
classical lp1 technologies

1254
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,440
so i'm okay now so the

1255
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,559
yes is growing

1256
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,760
okay i give you a few more seconds so

1257
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,200
please please go to them to the bowl

1258
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,160
okay and with this

1259
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,280
i will

1260
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,960
end the session

1261
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,400
last chance

1262
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,079
ending the session

1263
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,960
so for this one we got 11 to 2

1264
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,359
so yes i think that that there are

1265
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,960
people in the room

1266
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,720
willing to take more work and now i'm

1267
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
seeing questions

1268
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,440
more and then careless

1269
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,920
yes i think it's a good idea to

1270
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,280
reshutter but

1271
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,359
can we i don't know the difficulty but

1272
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,000
to change the working group name because

1273
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,119
if we

1274
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,920
say we are in lp1 and we don't do lp1

1275
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,280
it's quite strange so well

1276
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
named slow

1277
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,559
so i mean eric was that a very difficult

1278
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,119
thing to do

1279
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,559
well it was chartering and working

1280
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,559
yeah what's in your name right so

1281
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,000
explain speaking what's in a name

1282
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,319
i would assume changing the name is kind

1283
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,440
of a useless fight

1284
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,559
change the charter simply

1285
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,880
okay

1286
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,240
we can have fun in getting the the name

1287
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,720
and you know seek over for doesn't call

1288
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,200
it seek

1289
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,839
rook whose name is seek

1290
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,359
but if it takes you know for me a new

1291
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,200
working group to call it shake and then

1292
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,680
i agree it's it's wasted time

1293
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,919
so

1294
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,880
carlos

1295
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,920
yes so

1296
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,800
regarding the lp1 architecture draft

1297
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,000
first things for the updates

1298
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,160
including these extended scenarios

1299
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,839
beyond the original lp1 architecture i

1300
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,400
hope that perhaps in future

1301
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,599
updates the mesh topology might also be

1302
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,359
explicitly

1303
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,480
mentioned

1304
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,160
and then on the

1305
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,040
point of check over foo perhaps we might

1306
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,640
also consider

1307
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,680
uh

1308
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,040
chic parts

1309
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,400
over full

1310
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,359
for example at the moment in the 1504

1311
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,520
draft that we have at six load

1312
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,920
what we are using is only the

1313
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,000
header compression part of chic

1314
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,319
and we are sticking to

1315
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,119
fragmentation based on six lowpan

1316
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,040
or six low fragmentation so that's

1317
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,119
perhaps something else to to discuss as

1318
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,359
well

1319
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,160
yes basically we could we could have

1320
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,720
text like saying the sh shake

1321
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,440
fragmentation was designed to work over

1322
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,000
a single hop or a single compute or a

1323
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,480
point-to-point communication basically

1324
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,800
it's not meant to be forwarded to be

1325
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,400
relayed if you want to afford fragments

1326
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,559
then all the iraq your system

1327
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,480
goes away because you don't know how to

1328
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,839
route

1329
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:32,720
the

1330
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,359
air q back and probably you'd better do

1331
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,200
something like

1332
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,760
the lp one which which was i'm sorry the

1333
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,440
sixth open fragmentation which was

1334
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,760
redesigned for this and and you kind of

1335
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,680
hint that in your document already

1336
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,040
talking about

1337
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,920
the the the buffer that we use in the

1338
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,559
intermediate nodes etcetera so

1339
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,119
basically we're talking about rfc 8930s

1340
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,520
8931

1341
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,200
so yes i mean all this can be discussed

1342
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,359
just just a reminder that we put in the

1343
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,760
architecture of things which are

1344
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,839
kind of agreed

1345
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,760
inside the working group things which

1346
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,200
are stabilizing

1347
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,799
now the discussion over the mesh you've

1348
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,040
just started it it's very important and

1349
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,720
very interesting but we need more inter

1350
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,960
meetings to agree on what goes

1351
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,319
you know cast in stone in the

1352
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,760
architecture

1353
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,240
and so there's no text because we just

1354
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,319
started that discussion i was not ready

1355
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,480
i did not have a feel that i could write

1356
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,599
something that we agreed about

1357
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,119
because as you know there is the outcase

1358
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,559
and the easy case right the easy case

1359
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,480
mean when you have repo and then

1360
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,160
non-storing model and ingress

1361
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,839
replication that's the

1362
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,000
easy case and the hard case is going

1363
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,640
over multiple harp with shake without

1364
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,240
expanding the packet at every help

1365
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,400
that's hard

1366
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,160
yeah that's fair enough yeah thank you

1367
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,880
okay do we have any other discussion on

1368
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,640
either the architecture of rechartering

1369
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
we have we we are now in the richard

1370
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,200
trains discussion and there's no slide

1371
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,760
beyond the fact that you know the new

1372
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,040
things that we could discuss in the

1373
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,520
architecture really you know she cover

1374
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,799
mesh or

1375
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
um

1376
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,040
even talking about the next header all

1377
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,240
this is

1378
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,280
is uh

1379
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
uncharted for us so we cannot really go

1380
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,520
too deep into those things in the

1381
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
architecture we already have the

1382
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,119
point-to-point discussion there

1383
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,959
so anything

1384
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,040
else

1385
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,839
so

1386
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,880
it is known then we go to the aob

1387
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,720
so do we have any

1388
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,839
other business

1389
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
want to thank lauren for his hard work

1390
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,200

1391
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,760
other business and also thankful
