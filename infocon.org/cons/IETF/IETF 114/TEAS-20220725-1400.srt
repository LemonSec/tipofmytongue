the qr code so we're going to try to

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000

i didn't participate in anything

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
yesterday so i'll mention it this is uh

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
uh our rules for participation basically

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
everything you say and do here becomes

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
part of our record if you're not

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
familiar with the notewell please go

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
look at it at the the link right off the

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,840
ietf page

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,240
in the past we've been asked to remind

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,399
the working group about

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
how we treat each other and to make sure

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
we treat each other professionally and

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
with respect

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
we have we weren't asked to say at this

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
time but we thought it's a good uh habit

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
to keep reminding the working group

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
i've already talked about us being

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
online and uh also in person and that

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
we're going to be managing the queue if

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,879
you

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
don't know how to get the the tool uh

57
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
go to the qr code that's on the backs of

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,680
several uh of the chairs or go online

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
and you can find it at the

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,560
the agenda

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
um

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
i think we've probably hit all of these

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,560
things already with the exception of the

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
the note taking we are doing

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,760
collaborative note-taking as we

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
generally do

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
um the please

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,239
jump on uh the link and that's shown

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
here and i'll drop it into chat in just

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
a moment or someone else will for me and

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
help make sure that what we say here is

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,680
accurately captured you don't need to

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
capture what is being presented just the

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
discussion

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,000
around the slides and around the topics

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
we have a pretty packed agenda so i'm

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
going to keep going forward

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
so you know we're here to produce

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
documents so this

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
gives us a little bit of a taste of

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
where we are

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
we don't have any new rfcs but we do

83
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,120
have one in queue

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
so that's great thanks for all who

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,040
contributed to that we have a couple of

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
documents that are post

87
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,239
last call

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,120
the first one uh there was a bit of

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
technical change during the last call

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
and it hasn't hit the level of saying we

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
need a second last call but it's hit the

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
level where we want to give people ample

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
time to respond to it i know i have one

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
comment that i personally haven't gotten

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
to and i promise i'll get to it this

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
week but if everyone can take the

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
opportunity of being here this week take

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
a look at it uh adrian's here he's the

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
editor if you have something you want to

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,599
discuss

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,720
corner him

102
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
or just send it to the list

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
um the pcc use cases uh that's been

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
around for a while that is uh should be

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
uh submitted soon

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
we also have uh several documents that

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
have gone through

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
adoption recently and one of them we're

109
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
going to talk about later

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,240
we did receive one incoming liaison

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
it is somewhat interesting they are not

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
asking for any response but it is worth

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
noting that it came in

114
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
and take a look at it and see what this

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
other sdo is doing in areas we are

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
working on

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,198
not surprising it's on slicing

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
as always we remind you that we continue

119
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
our working remote working

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
in hybrid mode uh we have working group

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
resources that are available to anyone

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
in the working group if you're

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
interested just contact the chairs if

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
you when you send it to the alias it'll

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
hit the three of us and we can take

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
action on it

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
and uh just as always it's good to

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
remind everyone of our ipi rpr process

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
one of these years we'll remove new step

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,759
we've had that new step now for a few

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,000
years so we should not call it new but

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
and with that i think we're going to

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,240
move to the next slot

134
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960

lewis for

144
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
collating all the status reports and

145
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
putting the slide deck together

146
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
next slide

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
we have

148
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
26 working group documents they're all

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
listed here

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
there are three documents that are

151
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
colored in blue here that that are on

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
the agenda today

153
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
there's one the gm plus extensions for

154
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,160
shared mesh production that's in the rfc

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
8sq

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,680
that leaves us with 22 documents and

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
the status of all those 22 documents

158
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
are covered in this deck that includes

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,479
the four

160
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
documents that we just adopted and

161
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
also the two for which we successfully

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,919
completed last call in recent weeks

163
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
given the packed agenda i will not be

164
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
going through the status of each and

165
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
every one of these documents but i will

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
uh however double click on a select few

167
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
which we

168
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
believe needs some immediate attention

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
uh so let's start with slide

170

document

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
this has been around for some time there

206
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,399
hasn't been any new revision made to

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,880
this uh since the last session

208
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,399
uh

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,240
but the authors have indicated that this

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
is uh about one editorial rev away from

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
uh

212
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
uh from them uh

213
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
requesting working group last call so

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
please do give this document a thorough

215
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
read and

216
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,000
review it uh in anticipation of a

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
working group last call uh in the coming

218
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
weeks

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
uh can we go to slide eight

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
this is the gmpls controller interwork

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
document um there hasn't been any

222
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,279
changes to this document since the last

223
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,240
session

224
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
uh from the status report of

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
of the last session

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
it doesn't seem like there are any open

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
issues either so the question that we

228
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,600
have for the authors is

229
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
are there any pending items that you

230
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
would like to take care of before this

231
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
can be considered for working with last

232
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,000
call

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,200

sure adrian would be happy to comply

263
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
can we go to slide 16 please

264
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
this is the t service mapping young

265
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
document um

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
in the report that drew sent

267
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
there is a comment at the bottom which

268
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
says that this is currently blocked by

269
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,760
the essa policy young document

270
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
the essa policy young document which was

271
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
adopted in spring

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,079
hasn't

273
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,880
been updated in a while i think drew did

274
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,440
bring that up on the spring mailing list

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
and there was a response from kamran who

276
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
holds the pen that

277
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
he would get to it soon

278
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
from the service mapping

279
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,560
point of view

280
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
all you need is some sort of a reference

281
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
to

282
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
the underlay tunnel or the policy onto

283
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,279
which the service is mapped this could

284
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,320
be a direct reference so all you need is

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
a key for the policy or it could be some

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
sort of an indirect reference where

287
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
you use color or some tag to

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
uh do the mapping

289
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,880
so this should be a fairly

290
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
straightforward dependency and

291
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,720
through i'll i'll work with you and come

292
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,079
around in the next few weeks and get

293
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,079
this sorted this shouldn't take too long

294
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,079
can we

295
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
go to

296
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,040
slide number

297
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,160
19 please

298
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
we took a couple of young documents to

299
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
last call

300
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
in recent weeks we haven't closed on

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
them yet

302
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
this is the first of the two this is the

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
path computation young document

304
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,959
there were several comments that were

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
raised during last call um there's one

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,399
revision uh containing the changes that

307
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,760
for the items that have been addressed

308
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
on the list that should go in uh this

309
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,639
week as i've been told

310
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
there are

311
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
still a few pending items and those

312
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,120
should follow up in

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
another revision shortly um

314
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
the plan is to have a

315
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
a follow-up working working group last

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,399
call

317
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
maybe a short working group last call to

318
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,519
give the working group uh

319
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
sufficient time to review the latest set

320
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,800
of changes

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,880
next slide uh actually go to slide 23.

322
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
this is the young te document

323
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
again this is in the same boat as the

324
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
previous one

325
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,560
rev 30 was published

326
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
to address several comments that were

327
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
raised during last call there are still

328
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
some pending items the one sticky issue

329
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
is with respect to

330
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
management of identities

331
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
there are a couple of suggestions uh

332
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
more than one at least where a certain

333
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
was made to

334
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
have ayana managed uh

335
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,959
identities module um

336
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,839
they

337
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
this is turning out to be a bit complex

338
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,680
for certain scenarios it's a bit

339
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,079
impractical as well so the others are

340
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
trying to figure out

341
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
ways to address this so once this item

342
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,480
is resolved there should be another

343
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
revision coming out and

344
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
like with the last one the expectation

345
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
is that we'll have a short working group

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
last call for the working group to

347
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,440
review the latest set of changes

348
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
um that's all we have in this slide deck

349
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
any any questions on any of the working

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,519
group documents not just the ones that i

351
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,680
just covered

352
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
i don't see anybody rushing to the mic

353
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,399
so we can move on to the next slot

354
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
can you hear me

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
uh yeah we can uh can you change i mean

356
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
you should be able to uh

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,639
move move the slides by yourself

358
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
i'm looking for some control i don't see

359
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
any control to move the slide

360
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,599
one second

361
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,160
no i don't have control for the slides

362
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
just keep going i'll change okay okay so

363
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
i'm intel busy for away i'm presenting

364
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
on behalf of kotors

365
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
this new draft uh proposes some updates

366
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
to the itft types which are the final

367
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
c8776

368
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
next slide pleaser

369
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
okay some background okay what we needed

370
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,959
the word discussed uh was that

371
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,680
we need to do some tiny update to the

372
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
itft type-c module which has been

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,279
already published in rc8776

374
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,040
to support some of the changes on

375
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
on the t tunnel model or under documents

376
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
which are really for working group plus

377
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,480
caller at this moment in time what we

378
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,560
need is just to define a new type death

379
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
and a new grouping not that much

380
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,639
and we were discussing uh during last uh

381
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,279
meeting what is the best approach

382
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,440
to move forward with such a small update

383
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,639
we had

384
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
some um issues with going for a complete

385
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
rfcbs and we got some suggestion which

386
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
we follow and we ask you that option

387
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
we got that adoption but we get some

388
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
comments uh we got some technical

389
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
concern on the need for a common

390
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,199
grouping

391
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
the describing coding switching time and

392
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,680
different opinions were raised during

393
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,480
the

394
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
process approval

395
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,759
during the approval on the process

396
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,040
somebody was

397
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,680
in favor of updating the rsc like we

398
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
proposed in the rafter

399
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
other were more in favor of obsoleting

400
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,519
usc 8776 and to go with a complete visa

401
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,240
and

402
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,079
and the third option was also to define

403
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,320
a new a new model

404
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
which just provided the additional

405
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
elements

406
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
another issue we got uh there are a few

407
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
uh post-working group production

408
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
comments

409
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,399
one is to move some of the identities

410
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
from the itf t module into the te types

411
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
is some of the proposal for addressing

412
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
the working group let's call comments on

413
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,959
the itft

414
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,759
yeah model there was some comments from

415
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
the on the photo identifier and i

416
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,000
received the comments from ayana they

417
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,160
did an early review and they agreed they

418
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,079
proposed some changes to the to the

419
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,599
session next slide please

420
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
okay the first issue is the technical

421
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
comment on the encoding switching types

422
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,959
the comment was basically why do we need

423
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
a common grouping

424
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
which

425
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,799
because we don't know whether we need to

426
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,280
have a common definition for switching

427
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
and encoding uh for all the these

428
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,559
modules

429
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,960
that will be developed in the future

430
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
um

431
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
the opinion uh is that well the pac

432
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,559
combination rpc has a strong

433
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
requirements to be aligned with a tea

434
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
tunnel model there were long extensive

435
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,880
discussion at the beginning of the work

436
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
that

437
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
everybody agreed on the importance of

438
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
keeping alignment between the detailed

439
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
model and the computational piece

440
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
structure

441
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,520
we initially copied the definition from

442
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
the coding switching type from the tnl

443
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
model and immediately went out of sync

444
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,039
because there was a change done on the

445
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
mother so the grouping

446
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,160
in young is being defined to avoid this

447
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
problem

448
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,170
[Laughter]

449
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,799
everybody

450
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
hello

451
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
hello

452
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
uh hi atala we're having a little

453
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
trouble hearing you if you can try

454
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
repeating the last few a few sentences i

455
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
think will be okay yeah okay

456
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
thank you um

457
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
okay i say that the uh the

458
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,919
the can you hear now

459
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
okay okay the grouping is already

460
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
defined and the proposal is to move it

461
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
in t types to make it available to

462
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,919
anybody who needs to use it

463
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
the microphone is that there is no major

464
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
if you keep the grouping as it as it is

465
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,760
today we are causing the problem to

466
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,919
somebody in the future which may need to

467
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
implement just this grouping and we'll

468
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,280
need to implement the itft module just

469
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
to import the grouping

470
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,000
moving a grouping here will not

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
cause an additional trouble because it's

472
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
not mandating people to use it if you

473
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
don't need the regrouping you don't need

474
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
to use it even if it is defined in the

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
itft types

476
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
so we don't think that moving the

477
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,919
grouping from the itft and the itt types

478
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,240
is causing any harm

479
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,799
but it is just helping the people if

480
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,640
they need in the future

481
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
and the real issue that we see here is

482
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
just that this moving this definition

483
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
from the itf

484
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
d module to if it has maybe delayed the

485
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,640
progress of the itft module but this is

486
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
more a procedure rather than a technical

487
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,320
issue so the proposal is to keep the

488
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
grouping

489
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,120
if you are able to move forward

490
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
this document

491
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
in a timely fashion

492
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
let's comment next slide

493
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
okay there was a couple of comments from

494
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,039
saudi one was about the fact that

495
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
at this moment in time in the topology

496
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,640
model we have a different set of

497
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,440
identifiers in the net for networks node

498
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
links and termination points in the

499
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,600
network topology and in the edit

500
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,320
topology for example the node id is

501
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
defined in the network topology as a uri

502
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,760
the 18 already is defined as a dot

503
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
required and there are some issues in

504
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
some

505
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
deployments where people would like to

506
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,480
use the node id so the proposal is to

507
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,679
update the t types to make it a uni a

508
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,640
union between uri and the existing uh

509
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,799
type for example that you know that it

510
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,400
can be defined as a union between the

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
dotted code and the uri

512
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,400
another sec a second email that was

513
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
embraced is some concerns on the

514
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,640
definition of the ttp identifier as a

515
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,960
binary and again the proposal here was

516
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
to make the ttp identifier as a union

517
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
between binary and the uri

518
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
i think this proposal requires some

519
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,919
discussion but of course they may

520
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,559
broaden the scope of the update

521
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,120
so we need to discuss and see

522
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,280
how to deal with those comments

523
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,799
next item

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,679
you have a couple of people in queue and

525
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
asked them just to go keep it short so

526
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,080
tarek

527
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,840
about this uh uh hi this is tariq um

528
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,440
my question is about the union

529
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,679
i i realized that you haven't discussed

530
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,919
thoroughly this so but uh are we

531
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
allowing are going to allow a mix of

532
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
nodes to be identified

533
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,760
by different ways one is yuri one is

534
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
dotted quad and in the same topology and

535
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
that's one thing and the other thing is

536
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
uh

537
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,200
um

538
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
do we do we rely on parsing the value to

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
know that this is a dotted quad or this

540
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,440
is a yuri it's it becomes uh um

541
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
error-prone something like that

542
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,200
but but uh we can discuss that i realize

543
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
that you want to still yeah yeah

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
absolutely this is something to discuss

545
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,080
in the context of this document yeah

546
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
good question

547
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
okay this the the last point is about

548
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
the procedural

549
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
okay

550
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,480
we had discussed the sum of options and

551
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,240
the issue in the version zero one of the

552
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
document and unfortunately we remove it

553
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,320
from the for the document that was

554
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
pulled out from working reproduction but

555
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,799
we got a comment from drew about that

556
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
would be good to to put some

557
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,600
justification maybe in appendix

558
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
since it is the first time we are doing

559
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
such an attempt and maybe i i tend to

560
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
agree with him maybe what we can do we

561
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,960
can bring it up if you agree to follow

562
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
the update approach maybe we can put the

563
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,080
appendix some texts that describe

564
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
the rational for

565
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
for the proposal

566
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,520
the key question that i found from the

567
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,919
discussion on this procedural issue is

568
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
whether we think as a group

569
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,679
that

570
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
we need to have a lightweight approach

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
for updated publishing your modules

572
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
because the the i think this is the key

573
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
issue

574
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
the content that we are putting into

575
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
this document up to today is something

576
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
which is quite mature because it's

577
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
coming from

578
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
working group documents some of which

579
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
are in working group plus school we are

580
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
just moving them into a new document but

581
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
if we go with a piece

582
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,600
of a 90 pages document where everybody

583
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,960
reviews

584
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,440
page by page and world reward

585
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,000
i don't think the the approval process

586
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
will be that faster

587
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
so i think the question the key question

588
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,200
here is whether we want to have such a

589
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
lightweight approach or not

590
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,279
i see someone in the queue

591
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
i cannot hear you

592
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
i had to turn the mic on um

593
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,039
yeah so john scutter here um

594
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,120
i i uh about the uh you know abyss where

595
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,159
um

596
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
everybody reviews line by line and word

597
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,200
by word

598
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
one thing that uh

599
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
the iesg are trying to do is for

600
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
business with

601
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,320
you know sort of well-contained

602
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
small change sets

603
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
um is to

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,799
only review the uh well-contained small

605
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,080
changes and not take it as an

606
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
opportunity

607
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,840
to do a um you know open season on

608
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
reviewing the whole entire document and

609
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
reopening past issues

610
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
so um

611
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
we can discuss further offline but i

612
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
would encourage you

613
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
you know for

614
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,919
documents that have small change sets if

615
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,679
you're trying to decide what to do

616
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,679
please talk to me before

617
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,960
deciding that it's just not a good

618
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
option okay thanks so yes yes

619
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
the piece can be a valuable approach and

620
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,400
we can

621
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
address the beast in such a way that the

622
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,840
review is only locked limited to the

623
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,120
changes sir

624
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,039
okay yeah that's yeah okay suggestion

625
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
again we can talk further offline okay

626
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,840
yeah

627
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
yeah we're we're pretty much out of time

628
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,600
but i'd like to close on this issue so

629
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,360
if you can get to that final slide i

630
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,799
think this is like the i think the

631
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,200
suggestion from john will solve this

632
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
issue

633
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,360
yes

634
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
because there will be looks a reasonable

635
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
approach yeah

636
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
okay

637
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
i think you can skip the next slide no

638
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
no i think we can we can follow up the

639
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
suggestion from john

640
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
looks like a good a good solution

641
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
okay so the next steps is to move

642
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
forward with addressing

643
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,480
the technical and procedural comments

644
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,520
and

645
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
then we need to align the working group

646
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
which are using

647
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
these new types i think that we have at

648
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
least the t path computation layer 3t

649
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
topology model

650
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
and then we can try to go as quickly as

651
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,400
possible to in group plus gold to avoid

652
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
blocking the the progress of those

653
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,200
depending working groups of course

654
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
we need to clean up the procedural

655
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,480
approach

656
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,720
thank you

657
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
yeah we we see no reason not to progress

658
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
this to last call very quickly as soon

659
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
as you get the document issues uh uh

660
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,679
cleaned up so if you rev the document

661
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,840
and say it's ready for last call expect

662
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,919
us to follow through with that thank you

663
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,240
thank you

664
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
okay

665
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
okay the test draft is about the big

666
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
belief of ctl to packet optic

667
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
integration i'm planning on vr for

668
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,320
photos and quarters again next slider

669
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,919
okay a quick recap okay uh

670
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,559
this uh document is analyzing the

671
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
applicability of the itf yam modus

672
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,600
between the mdsc and the optical packet

673
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,799
psc's

674
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,360
to disk to support uh

675
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
the packet of the integration in case of

676
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,279
multi-domain packet and multi-domain

677
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,720
optical network

678
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
the use cases that have been analyzed

679
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,159
are inventory service and topology

680
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,559
discovery in particular they multi the

681
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
link between routers and the rodents

682
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
and the discovery of all the optical and

683
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
eye packet parts

684
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,039
and

685
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,279
how it is possible to establish the two

686
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,360
vpn

687
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
which traffic engineering requirements

688
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,600
they can drive the setup of new optical

689
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
pattern

690
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
and next slide

691
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
what has been changed

692
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,679
okay we did some updates uh uh

693
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
we are generalized the description of

694
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,679
the srt part discover pad discovery is a

695
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,039
type of update

696
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,520
this was a a comment we received during

697
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,159
the last itf presentation and we

698
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
discussed that on the main list

699
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
so we made a description generic and

700
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
applicable to any technology that for

701
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,440
which

702
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
the t tunnel model can be used at the

703
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
mpi above the

704
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,559
packet controller this with mplst and

705
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,039
srt are just example of such technology

706
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,640
specific augmentations that can be

707
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,919
provided

708
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,320
to support this technology the text has

709
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
been reviewed and the description for

710
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,399
srt is also generic enough to cover both

711
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,760
srm pls and srv6 options

712
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
we think that instead the interdomain

713
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
option of bgplu

714
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,799
is considered oscilloscope because that

715
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
that's case that the t tunnel mode seems

716
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
not applicable and the solution is

717
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
slightly different and we decided not to

718
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,880
go into too many

719
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,120
uh options to analyze into the draft if

720
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,080
interesting we can set up a new draft if

721
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,399
there is a need for analysis

722
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,399
an additional change that we did on this

723
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,559
revision is that we added the analysis

724
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,360
for the lag link aggregation so how to

725
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,240
discover and set up and update the lag

726
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,520
in case of

727
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,919
intra domain links so links between two

728
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
routers in the same domain

729
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
with some optical path underneath of it

730
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
we didn't discuss

731
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
the analyze the intel domain lag because

732
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
in this case there is no multi-layer

733
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,200
coordination so it's not of interest of

734
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
a multi-layer

735
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,320
analysis

736
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,279
we found that the lldp configuration has

737
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,279
some implication when used with lag and

738
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,880
we analyze that

739
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,799
we need to make sure that the ldp is

740
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,880
properly configured to allow the road

741
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
damage looping to work properly and we

742
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,158
have also to update the link setup

743
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,799
update procedure

744
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,840
mp minor technique

745
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,399
please it is more in detail on uh

746
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,199
on the changer

747
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
of this not coming

748
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
okay this is about oh okay

749
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,960
okay

750
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
one was about the lldp uh the previous

751
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
slide i think you move two slides ahead

752
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,520
okay yeah this one we noticed that for

753
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,480
example if you enable ldp on the lag

754
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,960
you can enable ldp on both the long

755
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,520
members and the lag group so there will

756
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
be some links where you send the two

757
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
type of lldp packets one for the member

758
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
and one for the group

759
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,520
and this will but the cross-layer

760
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
discovery should be based only on the

761
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
lldp so the red and the blue for the

762
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,200
render the black in one in the example

763
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,559
of the slides

764
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,480
the uh what what you notice that in

765
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,960
order to make the interdomain link

766
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,039
discovery properly work

767
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,679
we the llp snooping should work on the

768
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,080
black on the black ldp packet so the one

769
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
cent on the lag members

770
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
and there are two suggestions in the

771
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,440
draft once the suggestion graph is to

772
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
disable the lag

773
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,519
on the aggregated ports so the red ledp

774
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
packets will not be generated by the

775
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,080
router not seen by the rodent and

776
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,159
everything will work in the discovery as

777
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,919
if there is no lag

778
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,679
there are other methods we found for

779
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,880
example in the standard there is a

780
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
definition of the link aggregation tlv

781
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
they may be used but some care has to be

782
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
taken to make sure that the router and

783
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,360
the rotor of course supports

784
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,519
those options because in this case you

785
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,840
need to be able to distinguish

786
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,559
on the road and side which lldp packet

787
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,360
belongs to which session and use

788
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,519
only the black llp packets for the

789
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,679
discovery

790
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,480
next slide please

791
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
and the multi-domain i introduce the

792
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,399
procedure has been slightly updated

793
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,720
because the first threats are the same

794
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,679
so in order to set up an ip link over

795
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,440
optical you have to create an optical

796
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
tunnel in the in the optical network you

797
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
have to create an internet client signal

798
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,720
which allow to steer the traffic from

799
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,760
the asus internet link over the optical

800
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
tunnel

801
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,399
as soon as you create

802
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,399
this configuration the optical domain

803
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,120
you have any any an internal link

804
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,880
between the two routers

805
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
which this link can be either discovered

806
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,960
by the packet psc if there is some

807
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
methods like ldp or proprietary

808
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,519
mechanism or if this mechanism is

809
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,640
missing it can be configured by the mdsc

810
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
in the previous version without lag

811
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
the configuration the configuration or

812
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,120
the quiz cover of this link was

813
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,840
sufficient to trigger the configuration

814
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,080
of the ip link over it but now with the

815
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
lag you still the the packet pnc doesn't

816
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
know whether this link has been created

817
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,519
to become an ip link or to become a

818
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,960
member of a lag

819
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,679
so we change a video procedure to

820
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
to enable the mdsc to explicitly tell

821
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,279
this to the pnc and the what

822
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,640
we we

823
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
consider we

824
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
take leverage the fact that the ip

825
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,200
topology is rewrite so the mdc can

826
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
create the link between the routers over

827
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,679
this ethernet link and this will trigger

828
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
the packet pnc to configure it the the

829
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,480
configuration of the link is still

830
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,440
done by the packet pc but the trigger is

831
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
now the creation of the link in the epi

832
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
topology by the mdsc

833
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,880
if there is the lag there will be a

834
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
different procedure to add the link to

835
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,320
the lagrange

836
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
next slide please

837
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,640
okay now we have

838
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,399
we have some open issues we are tracking

839
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,679
them on

840
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
on github

841
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,919
most of them is just

842
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
requiring people to to write the text so

843
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,559
we have no really outstanding issue that

844
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,880
requires a lot of discussion

845
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
there was a the only question that was

846
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
raised recently is whether there is a

847
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,880
need to add some examples for api course

848
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
or workflows for example some json

849
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,399
encoding

850
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
this can be useful if you want to

851
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,399
analyze the the details of the year

852
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,760
modus but

853
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,840
on the contrary is increasing they will

854
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,279
increase the weight and the size of the

855
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,480
document

856
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,960
so we are not sure whether this making

857
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
this change is a good idea or not from

858
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,320
the document

859
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
so we are

860
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,519
looking for feedback from the working

861
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,559
group

862
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,879
and there is some

863
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,040
need to continue working with screen

864
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
oscar is taking care of it

865
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
to discuss some of the

866
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,119
technology-specific augmentation for srt

867
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
to the t-tunnel model

868
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,560
thank you

869
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,918
any questions

870
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
so uh italy in the last meeting there

871
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,119
were several comments about

872
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,079
the use of sr specific examples in this

873
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,599
model

874
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,879
they i mean

875
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,918
the guidance given at that point was to

876
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,679
describe the procedures in a technology

877
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,159
agnostic manner and then bring in uh

878
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,320
sr specific examples or rsvp's basic

879
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,399
examples where there's a deviation

880
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,680
uh i i do see uh that there has been a

881
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,000
conscious effort to address some of that

882
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
but

883
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,440
it's nowhere near done uh at least

884
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,400
that's

885
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,079
that's my opinion and i believe my

886
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,079
co-author is also my co-chair is also

887
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
agreeing with me on that um so that's

888
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
something that you would have to keep

889
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,118
addressing as the document evolves

890
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
okay uh

891
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,839
okay can you okay maybe we can talk

892
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,240
offline i think we try to to generalize

893
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,760
it maybe something has

894
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
been over oversight okay

895
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,280
thank you

896
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
thanks

897
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,839
reza

898
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,680
uh hello everyone my name is reza rokuy

899
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,320
from siena on behalf of

900
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,880
my co-authors and contributors i'm going

901
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
to uh

902
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,359
present a network slice nba young model

903
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,920
next please

904
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,200
the changes

905
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,640
in the latest revision is outlined here

906
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,400
i'm not going to cover you know all the

907
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,280
bullets here it's self-explanatory but

908
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,599
uh overall we align the stp connectivity

909
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,560
construct that we have attachment

910
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,280
in the young model with the draft with

911
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
the framework we try to be

912
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,079
aligned with everything that we have on

913
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,440
the framework we also included some of

914
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,560
the

915
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
reusing of the

916
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,040
common model that we have vpn and so

917
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,079
forth

918
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
we also aligned

919
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
some of the choice uh for the young

920
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,839
model in the

921
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,440
for the values connectivity the services

922
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
that we have point to point point to

923
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,320
multipoint and any to any uh these are

924
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
all the types that define in the

925
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
framework

926
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
and uh

927
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,800
we put lots of examples thanks to john

928
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
he provided john

929
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,040
lots of examples that clarifies what the

930
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,320
model is and how we are going to use it

931
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,280
and there are some other aspects about

932
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,640
the dscp and match and we try to you

933
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,599
know

934
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,119
add more clarity to the yang model

935
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,079
the last bullet we remove 5g example

936
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,560
that we have because we have another

937
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
drive i'm going to present at the

938
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
shortly about

939
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,359
application of the nbi and generally it

940
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,079
network slice in 5g from that reason we

941
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,599
remove it from here and we added that

942
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,920
now there are few issues that i'm going

943
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,079
to discuss that are open issue that we

944
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,960
have and if you go to the next slide the

945
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
in general

946
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
to just have the baseline here

947
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,640
we put six different

948
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,200
ietf network slices in this picture

949
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
network slice one all the way to six

950
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,320
with the various connectivity that we

951
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,000
can have we can have point-to-point

952
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,839
point to multipoint n2ne and we put

953
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,680
those examples here

954
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
just to

955
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,160
have a baseline and clarity that

956
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
generally speaking the connectivity

957
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,079
construct has one direction which is

958
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,440
specific so low it can belong to a group

959
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
connectivity group so a group has

960
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,560
multiple connection potentially with the

961
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,520
different slo and this is the idea that

962
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
we go after again this is aligned with

963
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,640
the framework document that

964
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,240
we are based

965
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,480
if you go to the next slide the first

966
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,839
issue that we are going to uh this open

967
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,520
issue is about the policy slo sle policy

968
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
as you see in the model at the beginning

969
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,640
of the model we have the policy this

970
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
policy is defined in the three different

971
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,079
areas at the network slice layer at the

972
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,800
group layer and the connection layer the

973
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,480
question here is

974
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,880
do we need to

975
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
have an ability to first of all

976
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,400
configure this policy as a model or this

977
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
should be part of uh it should be

978
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
outside of the model so this is one

979
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
aspect and another aspect is so

980
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,119
so-called inheritance

981
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,160
and update if for example we want to

982
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,599
create a

983
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
itm network slice with the well-known

984
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,680
gold policy and somebody says oh i want

985
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
that gold policy but by the way i want

986
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
to just change one attribute of that

987
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,359
should

988
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,480
should we allow that how we should do it

989
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
do we rewrite everything or do we

990
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,040
specify that a specific attribute that

991
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,359
inheritance and update comes from that

992
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,160
so basically the first issue is policy

993
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,720
related creation of the policy update

994
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,520
and inheritance and this is the still uh

995
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,240
under discussion uh that we have a

996
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,480
weekly meeting about this one and more

997
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,240
than happy to hear everybody's uh

998
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,079
idea about this one and what's the best

999
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,760
way to handle it next please

1000
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,839
the second one is uh the

1001
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,560
right now at the

1002
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,839
match i

1003
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,040
criteria that we have we are specifying

1004
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,480
match and value and the question is

1005
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
if you want to have a

1006
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,200
complex combination of the ip header for

1007
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,400
the match

1008
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
should we allow

1009
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,119
this or not and if you want to do it is

1010
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,000
this reasonable to use acl type of the

1011
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,319
reference here and

1012
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,240
there is a pros and cons obviously but

1013
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
this is an open issue that

1014
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,599
that adding that acl might help here but

1015
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
again we need everybody's

1016
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,200
the opinion about that one

1017
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,440
if you go to the third

1018
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,319
issue that we have

1019
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,920
the summary of this one is if you take a

1020
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,160
look at the bottom left

1021
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,359
picture

1022
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,119
we have stp

1023
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,560
today stp peri which has two area

1024
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
protocol and opec generally speaking the

1025
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
idea here is we want to be

1026
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,720
quote unquote technology agnostic from

1027
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,200
that aspect we define a group of

1028
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
attribute types and value from that

1029
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,720
aspect we didn't try to two examples is

1030
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
in the middle picture for example for

1031
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,000
the aesthetic routing or bgp but we on

1032
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,240
purpose we didn't we didn't put that one

1033
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,200
in the protocol because that idea of the

1034
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,160
technology agnostic is not

1035
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,400
there anymore from that aspect we have a

1036
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,880
generic concept of attribute and value

1037
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
and also we added a opaque which adds

1038
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,920
more flexibility the issue is on the top

1039
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,280
right

1040
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
if for the interoperability issues if we

1041
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
have these two

1042
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
the yank could

1043
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
have some intra ability and we need some

1044
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,200
proposal and the feedback from the young

1045
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,599
doctors and working group to see what is

1046
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,000
the best way to handle it what is the

1047
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,359
balance to

1048
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,000
put something specific but at the same

1049
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
time we keep the idea of the technology

1050
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,599
as

1051
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,359
agnostic idea here and this is just i

1052
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,359
bring it up to make sure we are all

1053
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,040
aware of that and if there is any

1054
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,760
proposal and i'm sure this is not the

1055
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,640
first time happened but if there's any

1056
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,440
proposal how to fix this one it

1057
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
would be more than happy to take that

1058
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,200
yeah in other models i don't remember

1059
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
off the top of my head which but i can

1060
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,720
find it uh what we've done is um added a

1061
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
i believe it was a choice actually it

1062
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,960
doesn't matter the specifics we added a

1063
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,920
place where um for future augmentation

1064
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,720
for technology specific augmentation

1065
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,200
so rather than putting an opaque value

1066
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,680
you put a a place i think it was a

1067
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,720
choice statement do you have an example

1068
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,160
if you can send it to us it would be

1069
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,280
great

1070
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,800
thank you

1071
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
if you go to the

1072
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,240
fourth issue uh

1073
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,359
so uh

1074
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,680
there was some discussion about

1075
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,560
uh

1076
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
adding to the model as an the idea some

1077
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,520
type of the topology of the network this

1078
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,160
is quote unquote similar to the

1079
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,560
the v2 child type 2 vn that is specified

1080
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,359
is hctn there was some discussion that

1081
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,079
it might be needed but the general

1082
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,160
question that we have is this something

1083
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,240
that we want to do because again we

1084
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,400
don't want to remove that technology

1085
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,119
agnostic concept from the model and the

1086
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,680
question is do we need to do that one

1087
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,319
and if the answer is yes we have to do

1088
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,200
that one we can add some type of the

1089
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,400
the

1090
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
similar type to we end in the model but

1091
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,839
at this point we want to make sure

1092
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,839
the question is do we need it yes or no

1093
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,680
and if the answer is yes we are going to

1094
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,000
continue going forward

1095
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,960
and i think the last slide is going to

1096
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,640
give us uh

1097
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,280
okay there was uh

1098
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,800
is this uh okay i thought there's a five

1099
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
issue there are four of them so at this

1100
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,079
point we are going to uh

1101
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,480
resolve the open issue that we have and

1102
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,400
if there is any further comment more

1103
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,480
than happy to hear that

1104
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,839
any question comment please

1105
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,800
thank you very much uh

1106
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
regarding the

1107
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
issue four

1108
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
um i think it's useful i think it's

1109
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,920
useful to

1110
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,839
let the client

1111
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
know what

1112
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,280
abstract topology is available before

1113
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,280
the service is being made

1114
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
i i know there this this ask has uh been

1115
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
uh around for a while like i think even

1116
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,960
before we adopted there were some

1117
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,040
examples for it and it's it keeps coming

1118
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,560
back so i think it

1119
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
it it is

1120
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,520
it should be discussed and added if you

1121
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,760
can there are existing ways of

1122
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,319
representing the customized topology and

1123
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,960
uh sharing it with the client um you

1124
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,480
could leverage those and then in the

1125
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,000
service request you can just reference

1126
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,960
that

1127
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,720
but that's something that you would i

1128
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,119
would recommend you to look at okay

1129
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,960
maybe i will talk to you that thank you

1130
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
for the comment

1131
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,959
thanks again

1132
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,560
hi

1133
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,440
um

1134
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,240
i'll rely on you for flipping the slides

1135
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,319
yeah i had a network i had a network

1136
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,240
bounce if you if it happens again just

1137
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,920
take over

1138
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,040
okay thank you my name is uh tarek saad

1139
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,319
and uh

1140
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,000
i'm going to give an update on this

1141
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,319
draft yang data model for network

1142
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,560
resource partition policy

1143
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,359
we have presented this draft multiple

1144
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,160
times in the past and this is just uh

1145
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,839
going to concentrate on the on the

1146
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,960
changes introduced in this revision

1147
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
next slide please

1148
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,280
you should have control

1149
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,140
okay

1150
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,250
[Music]

1151
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,240
thank you

1152
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,599
so a bit of introduction before we talk

1153
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,599
about the changes network resource

1154
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,839
partition the definition of it was

1155
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,000
introduced in

1156
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,440
ietf

1157
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
network slices draft

1158
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,520
it's a collection of resources

1159
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,280
identified in the underlay network to

1160
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,880
support the ietf network slice service

1161
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,359
the the nrp policy

1162
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,319
was

1163
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,640
introduced in

1164
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,079
itft's nsip mpls draft and is a policy

1165
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,720
construct that enables instantiation of

1166
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,480
mechanisms in support

1167
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,319
of service specific control and data

1168
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,599
plane behaviors on select topological

1169
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,440
elements associated with the nrp

1170
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
the draft defines a yang data model for

1171
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,880
the management of nrp policies

1172
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,400
on nrp

1173
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,839
capable nodes and controllers

1174
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,200
in an ipa plus network

1175
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,359
there were multiple modes identified for

1176
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,480
nrp uh for network resource partitions

1177
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,760
in the network uh one was partitioning

1178
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,520
in the control plane

1179
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,920
uh another one in the data plane and the

1180
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,000
third mode was

1181
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,599
when partitioning is happening in both

1182
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,920
control plane and data plane

1183
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,880
this yank data model will cover all

1184
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,440
three flavors

1185
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,119
uh

1186
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,160
so um the the changes introduced in this

1187
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,440
revision is a target uh node that's a

1188
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,240
state only that describes the filtered

1189
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,599
topology the filter topology is is also

1190
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,280
described in the

1191
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,680
in the draft idf

1192
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,480
network slices

1193
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,960
and we will talk a little bit more about

1194
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,680
it

1195
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,559
in

1196
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,319
in slide 9.

1197
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,520
so

1198
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,359
under topology container um we

1199
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,920
we have a list of filters

1200
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,319
uh there are multiple variants of

1201
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,839
filters that are defined in another

1202
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,640
draft

1203
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,839
i have a reference there

1204
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,520
the topological elements that match such

1205
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,280
membership criteria

1206
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
um

1207
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,440
the filters can be used for different

1208
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,200
different

1209
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,319
purposes

1210
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,040
one is overriding reservations on

1211
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,880
select elements

1212
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,480
but there are multiple variants of

1213
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,960
filters that one can use

1214
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,119
and as a result of filters there will be

1215
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,240
network elements that match the filter

1216
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,040
and the the set of network elements that

1217
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,440
of topological network elements that

1218
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,760
match the filter will be displayed under

1219
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,599
filtered topology

1220
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,119
uh we have

1221
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,720
two choices of

1222
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
uh ways to this to to describe this

1223
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,720
filter topology one is just a reference

1224
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,240
to a uh topology that we create for the

1225
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,559
network topology elements that matched

1226
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:45,839
the filter

1227
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,520
the other is to just reference the

1228
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,319
topological elements in the native

1229
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,280
topology as they are we just have

1230
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,640
pointers to them

1231
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,559
and

1232
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,119
the latter um we just have two

1233
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,359
references one is the network reference

1234
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,240
of the physical topology for example and

1235
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,880
the topological element key

1236
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,480
node or link

1237
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,040
so these are the two flavors of ways of

1238
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,119
presenting the filter topology

1239
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,000
in terms of next steps we

1240
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,920
we have engaged with authors of

1241
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,800
draft wdt's nrp yang

1242
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,640
we believe

1243
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,450
it it has some

1244
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,480
[Music]

1245
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,760
resemblance and we are working with them

1246
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,839
and finding ways to collaborate with

1247
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,079
them uh

1248
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,960
so we look forward to to continue this

1249
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,480
collaboration

1250
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,920
and the second next step item we have is

1251
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,000
to add some uh

1252
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,839
three instances of the data model in

1253
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,040
json uh for examples on uh

1254
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,000
network controller and on the device

1255
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,280
and as usual we welcome requests sorry

1256
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,599
we welcome reviews from the working

1257
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,760
group and as well as any feedback

1258
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,280
we have adrian in the queue

1259
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,920
uh hi there this is adrian um thank you

1260
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,760
for

1261
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,240
continuing on this document i'm i'm a

1262
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,839
little um unclear about your mode b

1263
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,559
which is the control plane only

1264
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,640
is what you're saying there that there's

1265
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,680
actually

1266
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,480
the partitioning is happening in a

1267
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,640
uh in a logical way in a central

1268
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,240
controller

1269
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,680
so uh it's the data plane is unaware of

1270
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,800
the partitioning but it's happening um

1271
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,280
in in some accounting mechanism and a

1272
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,000
central controller

1273
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,200
uh hi adrian uh thanks for the question

1274
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,400
um

1275
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,960
what we mean by control plane only is

1276
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
that the reservations are or the

1277
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,680
bandwidth bookkeeping is being done

1278
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,760
either on the controller or on the

1279
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,839
network element as a

1280
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,079
vis-a-vis rsvp way

1281
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,079
so the call admission module is sitting

1282
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,440
on the node or on the controller indeed

1283
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,960
it's possible

1284
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,599
but but the idea of that reservations

1285
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,920
are managed and maintained maybe by

1286
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,359
priority order uh on that reservation

1287
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,520
manager

1288
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,520
and not in the data

1289
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,240
okay yeah i think i get that maybe a few

1290
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,280
more words in the draft to um to help

1291
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,119
people like me

1292
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,559
okay sure thing thank you

1293
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,680
okay i don't see anybody else in the

1294
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,520
queue thanks tara

1295
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,000
uh we have both okay

1296
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,240
thanks

1297
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,720
oh she's presenting oh okay i think yeah

1298
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,960
bo is presenting next time thank you

1299
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,440
thank you so much

1300
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,559
hello everyone

1301
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,280
this is paul

1302
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,839
and uh

1303
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,559
i

1304
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,720
uh this uh an rpm module

1305
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,920
has been presented for several times so

1306
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,040
this time

1307
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,559
i'm going to give some updates on this

1308
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,240
on this draft

1309
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,559
next please

1310
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,720
i think you have slide control at least

1311
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,960
i don't anymore no

1312
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,680
okay

1313
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,559
okay thanks

1314
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,400
yeah i can control

1315
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,599
uh

1316
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,160
and in this uh version

1317
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,880
uh we add uh

1318
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,559
we add a section to describe uh like

1319
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,520
uh we give some summarize on

1320
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,880
the nrp modeling requirements

1321
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:25,078
breaking up pretty bad

1322
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,200
so we are not able to hear you

1323
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,640
bo your audio seems not to be working

1324
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,079
i think maybe we will uh skip bo and

1325
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,400
then come back when hopefully

1326
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,920
if you could do an audio test that would

1327
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
be appreciated

1328
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,359
uh my session keeps dropping locally so

1329
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,880
i don't know if others are having that

1330
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,400
problem also so i don't know if it's a

1331
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,480
meat echo problem or

1332
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,160
something else but we'll try to keep

1333
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,440
going so

1334
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,200
bo we'll come back to you at the end so

1335
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,960
we're going to move over to jay

1336
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,640
okay

1337
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,799
can you hear me

1338
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,799
we can see give us a minute yeah okay

1339
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,119
so you have 10 minutes for both these uh

1340
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,040
both these documents

1341
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
and you should have control

1342
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,480
yeah good

1343
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,040
actually i combined this end to end

1344
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,119
never slice uh with a hierarchical knob

1345
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,400
slice

1346
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,480
the two drafts will be presented

1347
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,839
together here

1348
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,119
i'm

1349
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,200
going to present this update of this two

1350
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,520
drafts and some

1351
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,359
considerations

1352
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,640
on behalf of the co-authors

1353
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,880
jimmy can you be a bit

1354
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,319
louder now

1355
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,480
can you hear me yeah i think that

1356
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,319
happens

1357
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,280
okay

1358
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,200
so here are some background about this

1359
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,680
work uh we know that narrow slicing can

1360
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,400
be used to meet the connectivity and so

1361
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
or sle requirements of different service

1362
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,319
and customers in the share network

1363
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,799
the concept naruto slicing was firstly

1364
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,960
defined in the cgpp

1365
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
and they only covered the ram and the

1366
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,200
mobile car network slides some nets

1367
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,119
and for the transport part of the

1368
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,200
end-to-end number slice item number

1369
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,319
slice is going to be used to provide

1370
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,319
end-to-end slicing and the performance

1371
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,079
guarantee

1372
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,400
in the idf network slice framework draft

1373
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,559
it describes the concept and the general

1374
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,280
framework of the itm network slice

1375
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,599
and it also mentioned that the metal

1376
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,799
slices can be realized by mapping one a

1377
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
group of the connectivity constructs to

1378
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,520
an nrp

1379
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,559
usually an itm left slice

1380
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,119
can cover either a single domain or

1381
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,040
multiple domains

1382
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,400
and the

1383
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,480
item network slides may be further

1384
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,559
sliced to provide fine granular

1385
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,359
connectivities and the resources for the

1386
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,559
hierarchical customers or services

1387
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,760
this kind of

1388
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,839
multi-domain slides or the hierarchical

1389
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,280
slide scenarios

1390
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
are briefly mentioned in the item native

1391
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
slice framework draft

1392
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,480
and we think it is useful to elaborate

1393
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,079
on these scenarios and also the

1394
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,000
realization considerations for this

1395
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,720
multi-domain and hierarchical cases

1396
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,520
so here is uh a typical ietf and that

1397
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,480
end-to-end i cannot slice scenario

1398
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,119
uh this is using the functional slice as

1399
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,880
the example

1400
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,520
in the transparent network segment uh

1401
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,040
one or multiple

1402
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,839
five general slices can be mapped to an

1403
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,799
itunes slice and this realization could

1404
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,000
be uh

1405
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,160
enhanced vpn service

1406
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,400
the in the enderly network

1407
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,240
the itm natural slices

1408
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,599
can be mapped to can be supported by a

1409
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,319
multi-domain nrp which is

1410
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,760
uh

1411
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,079
achieved by concatenation of multiple

1412
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,559
intra-domain rp's

1413
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,799
this mechanism is uh so similar to the

1414
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,160
intro into domain vpn cases

1415
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,319
so as shown in this picture we can have

1416
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,599
three tn transparent net domains and

1417
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,000
each domain how well multiple nrp is

1418
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,119
provided

1419
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,400
and the concatenation of the

1420
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,640
different intradomain nrps in the

1421
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,160
domains

1422
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,400
provide a multi-domain rp to support the

1423
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,160
end-to-end item number slide service

1424
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,040
so here uh

1425
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,640
in most of this uh interactional slicing

1426
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,799
realization is about

1427
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,119
how to provide the contact concatenation

1428
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,359
of the nrp's

1429
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,880
firstly uh

1430
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,799
i think a network controller will be

1431
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:33,680
needed

1432
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,680
for the creation and the concatenation

1433
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,720
of the multiple intro domain nrps to

1434
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,160
provide and annual slide service

1435
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,760
and secondly

1436
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,319
the ingress node of the nrp will need to

1437
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,960
steer the itf network slides traffic

1438
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,559
into this multi-domain nrp

1439
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,559
then the information of this

1440
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,760
multi-domain nrp will need to be carried

1441
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,200
in the package

1442
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,599
for the mapping of the slide service to

1443
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,799
the corresponding intradomain rps at the

1444
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,520
domain border node

1445
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,520
such information can be carried as

1446
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,400
either

1447
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,319
as an end-to-end nrp identifier or it

1448
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,160
can be carried as a list of the

1449
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,079
identifiers of the introduction in our

1450
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,880
piece to be traveled by the packet

1451
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,480
regarding the detailed

1452
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,480
encapsulations do you want to take

1453
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,040
questions now

1454
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,760
let me take a look

1455
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,880
john

1456
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,920
okay maybe you can ask

1457
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,119
yeah hi drama lulu cisco um

1458
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,680
back on the previous picture

1459
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,839
you're concatenating nrps or shouldn't

1460
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,839
we really be concatenating

1461
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,960
ietf network slices per

1462
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,440
transport domain i mean

1463
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,440
that would be a more modular

1464
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,400
uh

1465
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,240
cookie-cutter approach than trying to do

1466
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,319
this at the nrp level plus you might

1467
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,480
have different policies uh between

1468
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,559
different networks

1469
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,319
so uh

1470
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,400
just asking about how the

1471
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,839
how the problems being tackled uh

1472
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,920
in this case

1473
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,880
yeah i think uh that's a good question

1474
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,280
i think what you mentioned it can be

1475
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,119
considered as the

1476
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,040
inter domain option a

1477
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
so that we have a

1478
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,119
different uh

1479
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,920
uh

1480
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
network slice 10 points

1481
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,680
at the domain border nodes so that we

1482
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,480
can

1483
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,559
concatenate actually activates like

1484
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,599
services

1485
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,400
and

1486
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,040
that that is also an option

1487
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
okay so just something you should

1488
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,200
consider and then

1489
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,119
maybe at the hierarchical level it's

1490
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,599
more of a controller uh problem in terms

1491
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,960
of how to

1492
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,880
manage the uh

1493
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,039
connections between the different slices

1494
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,359
thank you

1495
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,680
yeah yeah i agree that is going to be

1496
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,280
that

1497
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,119
scenario can also be covered in the

1498
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,680
future versions and here we are mostly

1499
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,359
talking about the concatenation of the

1500
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,599
nrp's to build an end-to-end slice

1501
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:12,799
service

1502
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,400
thank you

1503
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,559
okay let me continue

1504
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,960
so the encapsulation of the multi-domain

1505
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,839
rp information with different data plane

1506
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,920
are specified in the following documents

1507
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,359
and i will not

1508
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,880
go into the details of this

1509
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,520
encapsulations please go and do it

1510
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,240
read this draft and give feedback thank

1511
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,240
you

1512
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,640
in the

1513
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,640
next following slides about the

1514
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,119
hierarchical network slice cases

1515
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,839
in this page we list several use cases

1516
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,079
of the hierarchical network slicing

1517
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,160
which means we can have the first level

1518
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,920
of network slice

1519
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,480
then have a final granular

1520
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,520
network slice uh created within the

1521
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,240
first level of network slices and we may

1522
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,599
have more hierarchy hierarchies based on

1523
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,160
this model

1524
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,079
in this hierarchical network slash draft

1525
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,599
we may

1526
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,559
describe some considerations about

1527
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,160
the realization of the hierarchical

1528
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,640
network slides in different

1529
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,880
network planes including the forwarding

1530
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,359
plane the data plane the management plan

1531
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,960
the control plane

1532
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,520
for the forwarding plane it is mainly

1533
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,119
about how to

1534
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,839
partition the resource hierarchically

1535
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,640
and how to represent the hierarchical

1536
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,839
partition resource to the network uh

1537
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,839
linked like the

1538
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,079
at the link level so we have different

1539
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,200
options to represent the hierarchical

1540
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,400
resources

1541
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,280
and this we have different

1542
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,440
impacts to the

1543
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,039
control plan and management plan

1544
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,680
the details are described a lot and for

1545
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,400
the fiddling uh the many major issues

1546
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
how to identify the hierarchical network

1547
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,000
and our piece

1548
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,920
and we need some

1549
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,440
identifier which can be used to identify

1550
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,880
both the

1551
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,119
uh first level of nrp and also the

1552
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,319
hierarchical levels in rpgs within the

1553
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,000
like the

1554
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,160
first level nrp

1555
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,119
we have also several options of this nrp

1556
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,960
identifier in the data plane

1557
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,520
like we can use a unified identifier for

1558
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,720
both

1559
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,440
for different levels of nrps or we can

1560
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,920
have a hierarchical identifiers to

1561
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,520
identify the different

1562
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,000
levels with a different segment of the

1563
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,200
identifier

1564
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,558
this will also have different

1565
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,680
impacts to the data plane

1566
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,558
encapsulations

1567
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,760
for the control plane i think the

1568
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,000
challenge is uh we need to use control

1569
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,400
plane to distribute the attributes of

1570
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,240
different levels of the hierarchical

1571
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,520
energies

1572
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,440
both among the network nodes and also to

1573
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,359
the controller

1574
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,880
with the number of the hierarchical

1575
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
natural slice increases the control

1576
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,680
plane optimization would be need to be

1577
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,000
considered

1578
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,160
as for the management plane

1579
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,720
uh the management plan needs to provide

1580
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,280
the independent life cycle management

1581
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,440
for different level of the nrps and the

1582
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,680
next slices

1583
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,839
also it will need to consider and

1584
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,680
maintain the relationship and the

1585
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,280
constraints between the different levels

1586
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,280
of anarchy

1587
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,559
so that the resource uh allocation or

1588
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,280
the

1589
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,640
some other

1590
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,559
constraints we need to be considered

1591
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,480
when create a

1592
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,000
hierarchical nrp within the

1593
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,799
basin rp

1594
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,799
if you could wrap up that'd be great oh

1595
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,039
yeah this is the last page

1596
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,760
so here uh the next steps the we think

1597
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,200
the end to end and the hierarchical

1598
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,599
number slices can be considered as

1599
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,079
advanced application of the active itf

1600
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,440
nanoslice

1601
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,000
while the majority of these two topics

1602
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,920
are not the same as the

1603
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,920
contents in the base item data slice

1604
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,079
framework draft

1605
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,079
and there was concerns

1606
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,400
raised about whether they can be

1607
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,440
stand-alone drafts because

1608
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,440
they're not very a large draft document

1609
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,280
and here we have a question to the

1610
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,880
working group

1611
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,680
should we consider to move merge this uh

1612
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,520
two drafts at the end to end and the

1613
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
hierarchical slice drafts

1614
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,039
into one document

1615
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,640
or do we keep them separate as is

1616
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,400
we would like to welcome for the

1617
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,240
comments and feedback so that we can

1618
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,760
update the drafts accordingly

1619
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,920
that's all so in the context uh in the

1620
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,520
context of the last

1621
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,319
the first draft in the last meeting

1622
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,960
uh we had said it would be best to see

1623
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,880
if you could merge the text with

1624
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,640
existing documents for example for

1625
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,799
example some of the text clearly could

1626
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,880
go to the framework it's not too late to

1627
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,480
get text into the framework it's much

1628
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,079
better to get it into an existing

1629
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,319
document particularly one that's about

1630
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,079
to go out the door than to have

1631
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,680
standalone documents that we have to run

1632
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,960
the process on

1633
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,640
so for both of these documents if

1634
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,400
there's an opportunity to take the text

1635
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,640
and put it into another document please

1636
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,760
do so and preferably a existing working

1637
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,680
group document and the best way to do

1638
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
that is send the text to the list talk

1639
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,280
to the authors i think some of them you

1640
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,440
may be a co-author on already so talk to

1641
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,440
yourself please get the text into the

1642
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,200
existing documents if you can thank you

1643
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,160
yeah

1644
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,520
that is a

1645
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
a good feedback i know well would like

1646
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,440
to welcome further feedback from the

1647
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,280
group on this that's that thank you

1648
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,720
leon

1649
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,799
hi everyone

1650
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,839
can you hear

1651
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:12,799
me loud and clear

1652
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,000
okay thank you

1653
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,839
do i have the control of the slice

1654
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:25,520
yes you should have control please

1655
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,960
please go on

1656
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,920
okay thank you hello everyone this is

1657
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,279
bien coming from china mobile i'm glad

1658
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,000
to do the presentation on behalf of all

1659
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,520
the co-authors

1660
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,198
the topic is about the segment routine

1661
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,080
best solution for hierarchical htf

1662
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,880
networks like this

1663
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,040
first just as

1664
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,759
mentioned just know by previous

1665
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,960
present presentation the concept of the

1666
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,080
hierarchical item network slices is

1667
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,839
based on the ietf terminologies

1668
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,920
network slicing itf network slides and

1669
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,319
network resource partition

1670
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,040
the hierarchical hf network slices

1671
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,000
describe the network slices which can be

1672
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,679
further sliced

1673
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,640
or combined hierarchically

1674
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,719
for example one of the possible

1675
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,279
scenarios is that an

1676
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,640
industry size needs to be divided into

1677
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,920
multiple customer slices

1678
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,719
this draft proposes a two-level

1679
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,839
hierarchical itf networks of slice

1680
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,120
solutions which is based on the segment

1681
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,238
routine

1682
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,960
generally speaking the level 1 network

1683
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,560
slice is realized by associating

1684
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,560
flex level with dedicated sub interfaces

1685
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,280
and the level 2 network slice is

1686
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,640
realized by using either policy with

1687
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,080
additional

1688
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,000
pid on little plane

1689
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,760
sorry it's a bit slow

1690
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,159
and now this slide shows the framework

1691
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:28,719
of the two-level hierarchical slices

1692
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,560
the level one

1693
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,719
is associated with the flex algo and the

1694
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,159
the traffic is steered into the flex

1695
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,880
algo passes using the prefixes or as a

1696
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,640
radio locators

1697
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,560
and the level two is associated with one

1698
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,440
or a group of isr policies under the

1699
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,440
level 1 nrp

1700
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,640
and the traffic of the level 2 network

1701
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,199
is built into the exa policies

1702
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,600
based on the framework described about

1703
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,880
the network resource is also partitioned

1704
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,600
in a hierarchical manner

1705
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,480
taking the bandwidth resources as an

1706
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,320
example

1707
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,880
the level 1 bandwidth is guaranteed by a

1708
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,040
layer three step interface with

1709
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,280
dedicated bandwidths

1710
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,679
and the prefix seed or srv6 locators is

1711
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,679
used at the data plane identifier

1712
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,840
and the level two bandwidth is

1713
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,719
guaranteed by pure with dedicated

1714
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,199
bandwides under the layer 3 sub

1715
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,480
interface

1716
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,520
and

1717
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,360
the rpid

1718
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,759
is used as the data plane identifier

1719
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,719
this slide shows the

1720
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,600
relationship about the nrp and the

1721
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,960
slides

1722
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,400
actually each nrp either level 1 or

1723
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,600
level 2

1724
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,239
both can be used to support one or a

1725
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,800
group of network slices

1726
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
this is consistent

1727
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,920
with the item for definition

1728
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,800
but

1729
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,600
for actual deployment

1730
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,400
i think it's much more complicated for

1731
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,239
launch nrp to be mapped to multi-slicing

1732
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,199
and it makes little sense

1733
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,239
since the resources of the level 2

1734
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,120
is already finally divided

1735
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,040
so here

1736
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,719
the level 2 nrp to slice is shown as one

1737
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,600
to one

1738
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,920
also we think if there is the

1739
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,320
requirement scenario

1740
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,840
that

1741
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,080
this can also be one two multiple

1742
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,719
this is one example for the whole

1743
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,360
solution

1744
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,640
for the picture from the bottom up to

1745
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,520
the physical network is divided into two

1746
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,280
nrps through

1747
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,440
the flux elbow and each nrp is mapped to

1748
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,440
one slice

1749
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,800
one is for the education slice and the

1750
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,239
other is for the health care slice

1751
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,040
for education slice there are two

1752
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,800
customers for example university one and

1753
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,960
the university too

1754
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,600
they all have different access points

1755
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,040
and interconnection

1756
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,920
for health care slice

1757
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,360
the slice

1758
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,000
the second slice there is only one

1759
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
customer

1760
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,280
based on the topology about the resource

1761
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,719
partition is like this uh

1762
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,960
taking p e one as example

1763
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,679
uh

1764
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,320
the physical interface one

1765
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,000
there will be two sub interfaces and

1766
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,440
under which there will be two or one

1767
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,080
queue respectively

1768
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,120
for physical interface 2 there will be

1769
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,880
only one

1770
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,199
sub interface and one queue under the

1771
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,360
sub interface

1772
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,800
and all the sub-interfaces and the cues

1773
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,719
are

1774
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:51,000
associated with the dedicated panel-wise

1775
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,040
uh the last picture illustrates the

1776
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,760
traffic forwarding

1777
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,480
from the picture we can see that the

1778
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,280
final result is that

1779
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,280
for the normal education traffic for the

1780
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,120
first slides

1781
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,840
the packet is encapsulated

1782
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,320
by the destination of

1783
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,159
understated associated with the specific

1784
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,280
flex algo and

1785
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,159
the traffic is forwarded through the

1786
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,960
layer 3 step interface

1787
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,480
and

1788
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,440
for the specific traffic coming from

1789
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,440
university 1 to university 2

1790
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,360
the encapsulation except the activistics

1791
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,800
header and

1792
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,960
srh

1793
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,760
also includes

1794
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,679
additional nrp id and the traffic is

1795
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,320
before they just shoot the kill under

1796
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,360
does that

1797
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,360
interface

1798
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,080
okay this is all for the solution

1799
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,440
businesses sincerely hopeful to get your

1800
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,120
feedback to

1801
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,320
improve our solution

1802
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,360
thank you very much

1803
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,600
thank you any uh comments

1804
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,280
then we'll move on uh one quick comment

1805
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,920
uh so irrespective of where um

1806
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,199
the text from

1807
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,520
uh g in the previous presentation goes

1808
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,159
uh this uh this ability should go to the

1809
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,560
spring uh we you can probably present it

1810
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,679
there

1811
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,719
and see where it takes you

1812
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,719
okay okay thank you for your suggestion

1813
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,679
if necessary we will present it in

1814
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,280
spring also

1815
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,120
and we also

1816
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,840
looking forward for the feedback

1817
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,360
increase thank you very much

1818
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,640
thank you uh robin you're next

1819
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,080
okay cow hear me

1820
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,360
uh the hello update that you just made

1821
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,600
uh should have been reflected but yeah

1822
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,920
in case it doesn't show up continue with

1823
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,159
what you see on the site

1824
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,880
you should have control

1825
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,000
okay

1826
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,719
uh hello everyone this is the champion

1827
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,600
huawei today i will do the presentation

1828
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,480
about the consideration on generalize

1829
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,400
the ietf network slicing

1830
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,440
okay here this is a brief background

1831
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,960
because we know we have this draft to

1832
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,280
describe the concept and the general

1833
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,800
framework of ietf network slides

1834
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,960
but now with the development and the

1835
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,640
deployment of iti itf network slides in

1836
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,719
different types of network

1837
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,960
for different applications

1838
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,199
there are emerging requirements about

1839
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,600
the new capability and the functionality

1840
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,880
of itr

1841
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
network slides

1842
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,840
is expected that the concept ietf

1843
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,360
network slice

1844
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,520
and the network resource partition will

1845
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,760
be generalized

1846
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,920
this document describes the

1847
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,159
consideration about the

1848
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:39,440
possible generalization of itf network

1849
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:44,400
slice and network resource partition

1850
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,320
okay so here this is the description of

1851
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,120
the

1852
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,280
relation between the nrp and the

1853
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,719
topology

1854
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,360
because we know that the nrp needs to be

1855
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,480
associated with the network topology to

1856
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,199
determine the set of network resource of

1857
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,960
the nrp

1858
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,320
so in the data plane the rp

1859
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,520
specific identifier could be used to

1860
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,560
determine the topology and the resource

1861
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,000
of the nrp for packet processing

1862
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,960
but we know now that we have this one

1863
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,280
dropped proposed in six months working

1864
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,560
group

1865
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,159
that's the

1866
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,360
that's this is the draft to describe how

1867
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,360
to use the ipv6 to carry the multiple

1868
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,040
topology id

1869
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,400
for the idp

1870
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,719
multi topology or the igp flexa ego

1871
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,280
because this is used to cope with the

1872
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,920
user cases that the sim forwarding

1873
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,440
addresses could be reused for packet in

1874
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,440
different topology

1875
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,280
that means that

1876
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,760
because we know that for the different

1877
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,320
multi-party we have the different

1878
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,120
forwarding address but we also have this

1879
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,760
the user cases but we use the same

1880
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,159
forwarding address but we use the

1881
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,600
topology

1882
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,320
to

1883
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,120
propose the id to identify

1884
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,000
the

1885
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,159
address to be used for the different

1886
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,159
topology

1887
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:19,440
so if we use this solution so that the

1888
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,040
rp id

1889
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,000
may be generalized to identify both the

1890
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,040
topology and the set of resource

1891
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,520
uh so here they are has this the first

1892
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,159
question what should be the relation

1893
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,560
between the ietf network

1894
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,159
uh slice and the multiple topology and

1895
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,280
the philosophy i mean there should be

1896
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,600
independent or that

1897
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,560
means this is the

1898
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,120
the multi topology should be the special

1899
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,199
case of the nrp

1900
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:54,879
so that's the first issue

1901
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,880
the second one i mean the nrp

1902
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,840
is allocated with a set of forwarding

1903
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,800
plane network resource to guarantee the

1904
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,920
sre that means os

1905
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,880
sr sro etc

1906
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,840
but now because as the development of

1907
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,760
the rp so the scope of the rp resource

1908
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,560
may be extended to cover other types of

1909
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,760
resource

1910
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,600
here i'll give these the

1911
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,800
several examples the first the resources

1912
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,840
need to be provided guaranteed latency

1913
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,080
for that net service

1914
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,120
all this the resource can be

1915
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,679
used for some network function of the

1916
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,880
nrp

1917
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,080
for example the security functions and

1918
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,239
also this is the result it can be the

1919
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,000
virtualized resource maybe that's the

1920
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,520
virtualized

1921
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,000
device to support the

1922
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,040
ietf network slides so here we have the

1923
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,840
two questions uh the first one what

1924
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,320
should be the relation between the data

1925
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,520
net and the ietf network slides

1926
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,600
and this is the another question can

1927
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,719
other services such as the security can

1928
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,480
also be seen as the ietf network slice

1929
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,920
or the nrp

1930
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,800
so means that the network slides not

1931
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,239
only used to guarantee the sro but also

1932
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,320
use for other services

1933
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,000
such as the secularity

1934
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,440
so here we also have this the rp for

1935
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,000
multiple connective constructs

1936
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
so here we give the example for the

1937
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,480
virtual list of the line service

1938
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,360
so we we can say that the virtual

1939
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,960
uh listed line can be mapped to the nrp

1940
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,239
so it can be uh one to one it can also

1941
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,679
to map or share the rp but here we give

1942
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,080
the example because here we can see

1943
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,159
there's a truly center line

1944
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,960
which is the two gigabit the bandwidth

1945
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,760
respectively but if one outgoing

1946
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,600
interface are shared by the two

1947
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
virtualized line

1948
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,360
so that's the question what the

1949
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,480
bandwidth should be for the nrp

1950
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,600
so i mean so here there's a two gigabit

1951
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,440
or that's the

1952
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,800
four gigabit

1953
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,760
or all this maybe other other gigabit

1954
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,320
for the virtual release line mapping to

1955
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,400
the rp

1956
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,679
so i here this is what should be the nrp

1957
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,280
for the water release of the line

1958
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,120
and here this is the last this

1959
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,320
generalization of the itr network

1960
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,960
slicing because we know at the beginning

1961
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,239
this uh ietf network slice is used for

1962
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:45,280
the 5g under to end the network slice

1963
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,239
but later this it of network slides has

1964
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,320
been extended to the

1965
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,400
operators the metro and the backbone

1966
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,679
networks

1967
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:56,239
but now as the deployment of intel

1968
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,360
network slides it can be extended for

1969
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
the campus network and the data center

1970
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,440
networks

1971
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,800
so and also maybe also the sd1

1972
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,600
but we know that for the operator for

1973
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,239
the operators the amperes or the s

1974
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,639
armpits or srv6

1975
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,360
as a tunnel but you know for the data

1976
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,600
center

1977
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,320
uh i finished this one it just lost the

1978
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,800
page okay so here are these also this is

1979
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,679
the

1980
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,080
uh this means that the

1981
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,360
uh itr network slides may be also used

1982
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,480
for the various ip tunnels

1983
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,280
uh

1984
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,280
uh besides the npr's and the srv6

1985
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,800
tunnels i mean the vxlan or the gre

1986
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,760
so here we have this the generic ipv6

1987
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,719
tunnel

1988
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,440
work that's for the network slicing used

1989
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,080
for other tunnels

1990
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,000
okay so here these are the questions so

1991
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,600
we would like to solicit the feedback

1992
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,800
and also try to reach the consensus and

1993
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,600
revise this document accordingly okay

1994
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,960
please question

1995
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,239
can you hear me yeah this is louie

1996
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,040
jaleel so i'm noticing that you

1997
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,360
for some reason it's more

1998
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,600
the way you're presenting is more static

1999
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,880
resources and dedicated resources

2000
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,199
you know you keep looking for

2001
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,520
i know we're allocating partitions all

2002
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,800
this other stuff but it looks like it's

2003
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,800
more static and hardened than being more

2004
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
dynamic that's what i'm seeing just

2005
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,360
overall from your slides is that correct

2006
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,480
or do you see it differently

2007
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,400
uh i'm not

2008
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,159
sure if you i catch you all these the

2009
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,639
point uh very well but here these are

2010
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,920
just this some of these the issues about

2011
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,440
means maybe

2012
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,400
the rp the resource you're not the

2013
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,960
bandwidth resource for the sre but the

2014
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,360
user can be used for the

2015
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,239
topology represent topology or maybe the

2016
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:05,799
security service etc yeah

2017
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,960
thanks robin uh same comment as the one

2018
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,000
that was made for uh ge documents

2019
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,760
uh i mean

2020
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,639
see if you can propose some text to

2021
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:22,159
the network slices document and for the

2022
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,560
underlay constructs for nrp in

2023
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,600
particular

2024
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,360
you may want to construct proposing text

2025
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,360
to the nsip mpls document

2026
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,839
okay thanks

2027
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,360
good morning again and this is rosario

2028
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,040
from siena on behalf of my co-authors

2029
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,440
i'm going to present

2030
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,679
application of ip ietf network slice in

2031
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,159
5g network slice

2032
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,320
next slide

2033
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,239
just a quick background if you are

2034
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,960
looking at the picture on the right

2035
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,560
right hand side this taken from the

2036
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,560
framework document

2037
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,520
there are various applications or use

2038
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,400
cases for itf network slides there are

2039
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,560
clearly mentioned in the

2040
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,120
framework document you can use the

2041
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,520
concept of itm network slides to for

2042
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,360
example

2043
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,400
do the connectivity in data centers or

2044
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,040
the whole sales and so on these are

2045
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,360
various use cases the one that we are

2046
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,080
referring here is a 5g obviously 5g

2047
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,560
network slicing is

2048
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,679
one of the

2049
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,199
the top runner at this time for the ietf

2050
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,520
network slice and the goal of this

2051
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,840
giraffe is basically address the red

2052
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,400
portion on that picture

2053
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,600
currently there are three drafts which

2054
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,800
are talking about various application of

2055
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,080
the

2056
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,440
network slicing in the context of 5g

2057
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,520
you will see these three drafts a

2058
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,400
different area of that

2059
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,159
is discussed

2060
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,320
as

2061
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,639
in the previous

2062
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,120
ietf

2063
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,679
the chair asked if we can

2064
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,840
combine all those drafts

2065
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,679
and have a new draft so basically

2066
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,320
today's discussion is combination of

2067
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,800
three drafts in a single draft to

2068
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,760
address various applicability and use

2069
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,800
cases of itm network slice as a general

2070
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
concept or solution

2071
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,320
in very specific use case is 5g

2072
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,040
so having that in mind if you go to a

2073
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,719
next slide

2074
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,679
it shows the

2075
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,600
what has been done at the very top layer

2076
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,920
very the higher layer

2077
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,719
we mesh three documents we just don't

2078
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,560
merge them but we add new content to it

2079
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,120
as well so we consider some of the

2080
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,880
progress that happening on the 3gpp 541

2081
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,320
which is the

2082
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,920
the

2083
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,120
management of the network modeling

2084
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,159
we also added a use case for that an

2085
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,679
example for that and

2086
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,960
keep in mind that this document is still

2087
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,800
in progress but the overall is we are

2088
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,760
basically merging those three documents

2089
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
as a whole and if you go to the next

2090
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,800
slide it shows the skeleton of the brand

2091
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,960
new document we have started at the

2092
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,880
beginning and there is no need for me to

2093
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,120
go through each item one by one but

2094
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,880
suffice to say that we already cover

2095
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:43,840
as an

2096
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,560
outer of those three draft we cover

2097
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,719
chapter one two three we went through

2098
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,280
that as a one cycle after

2099
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,080
the revision we are still doing it other

2100
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,320
chapters and we are uh

2101
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,480
today i'm going through this chapter to

2102
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,199
show the overall structure of the

2103
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,560
document and the seeking you know advice

2104
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,199
and the contribution from everyone so if

2105
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,520
you go to the next slide and starting

2106
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,920
from starting from the beginning this is

2107
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,080
simply the framework if you're looking

2108
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,960
at the picture on the right hand side we

2109
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,880
have

2110
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,360
run radio access network we have an

2111
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,400
access network and we have a cn core

2112
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,719
network which are

2113
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,560
dedicated to the 5g functionality

2114
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,280
there are values connectivity happening

2115
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,440
inside the run

2116
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,080
inside the core or between them those

2117
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,040
red area that you see is connectivity

2118
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,600
and as you see 5g network slicing it

2119
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,840
addressing the connectivity from that

2120
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,719
aspect the use case that we have here is

2121
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,199
there our tn transport network

2122
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,600
connecting values component network

2123
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,239
function in different areas and the role

2124
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:59,440
of the ietf network slice is how we can

2125
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,120
address that for any

2126
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,920
an example if you go to the next slide

2127
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,719
it shows a second level of detail for

2128
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,159
the examples

2129
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,159
depends on the rand deployment when we

2130
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,880
talk about run deployment there

2131
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,560
there are three rand deployment in

2132
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,600
general distributed red

2133
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,679
centralized run and cloud ran

2134
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,480
without going through the detail of that

2135
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,280
the difference is how the component of

2136
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,679
the radio access network are connected

2137
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,600
together are they

2138
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,320
everything is one network the one

2139
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,560
component we have or we are separating

2140
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,440
that one into the so-called centralized

2141
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,719
unique or the distributed unit

2142
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,120
and this is a cu and du i'm sure you

2143
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,440
heard about this acronym few times but

2144
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,920
the idea here is this picture you will

2145
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,679
you can go through the draft to see the

2146
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,440
detail but the idea here is

2147
01:31:56,239 --> 01:32:00,239
one single ietf one single 5g network

2148
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:03,040
slice depends on the run deployment can

2149
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,000
have multiple ietf network slices in

2150
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,080
other words there are different

2151
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,080
connectivity which is needed if you go

2152
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,560
to the picture at the bottom for example

2153
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,239
which is showing the

2154
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:15,679
cloudra

2155
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,280
there are components uh

2156
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,199
radio unit du cu and core and there are

2157
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,360
different connectivity that ins

2158
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,080
underscore one or two and so on it shows

2159
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,880
the multiplicity and the idea here is

2160
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,440
a single end-to-end network slice from

2161
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,639
5g perspective might have multiple iot

2162
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,480
of network slots and this is the idea of

2163
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,520
the whole

2164
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,239
picture you can go through the detail in

2165
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,719
the draft to see more so i'm running out

2166
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,280
of time i have to hurry up a bit

2167
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,159
next slide

2168
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,480
this one shows the

2169
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,440
from the left picture to the right we

2170
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:01,440
have itf network slice controller

2171
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,360
okay yeah sure

2172
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,440
so uh

2173
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,600
open issue theory

2174
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,880
first about the terminology that we use

2175
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,760
here

2176
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,520
in a specific

2177
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,760
should we use 5g

2178
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,239
end-to-end network slides or we remove

2179
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,000
that end-to-end because from the

2180
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,719
perspective of the 3gpp when they talk

2181
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,400
about network slides

2182
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,639
inherently they're talking about 5g and

2183
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,159
they are talking about end-to-end they

2184
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,480
never talk about these two

2185
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,639
explicitly so the first question is

2186
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,719
should we use or should we keep

2187
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:35,760
end-to-end

2188
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,400
the next one is should we use access

2189
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,960
network or in a specific radio access

2190
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,120
network so because again from the

2191
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,480
mobility is radio access so we feel that

2192
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,719
that for this question should be ready

2193
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,639
access network but we are open to any

2194
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,280
question that since you go to 3gpp

2195
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,520
document you will see a n you don't see

2196
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,440
a radio a and radio access network

2197
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,239
next slide

2198
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,040
next

2199
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,880
to address these questions

2200
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,960
and uh

2201
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,840
basically we are open to any suggestions

2202
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,000
any comments and uh

2203
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,080
more collaboration is needed

2204
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,120
from that aspect as well uh louis please

2205
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,719
yes

2206
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,560
in queue we have uh

2207
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,040
julian

2208
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,199
go ahead

2209
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,520
so first thank you for providing the

2210
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,760
combined draft

2211
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,119
i have one comment and two questions

2212
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:44,560
and the comment is about the open issues

2213
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,880
you know which term to use

2214
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,639
a 5g network slice or 5g network

2215
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,760
or 5g n2n network slice

2216
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,400
my proposal is to use 5g network slides

2217
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,320
so the first point is about uh 3gpp has

2218
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,920
no uh 5g n2 and network slides

2219
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,239
and

2220
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,679
and to a network slice scope is out of

2221
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,119
3gpp

2222
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:18,080
because the connection between upf to dn

2223
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,159
is out of the

2224
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:23,199
3gpp network slice scope

2225
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,520
and the third point is about

2226
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,840
bbf

2227
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,280
tr522 use

2228
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,560
5g network slides we also discussed uh

2229
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,239
this question uh you know uh to use 5g

2230
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,800
n2 and network slides or 5g network

2231
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,239
slides

2232
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:43,520
our agreements as to use 5g network

2233
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,040
slides so

2234
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,800
um

2235
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,560
my proposal is to use this term

2236
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,000
to keep the

2237
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,239
term consistent

2238
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,360
uh okay my two questions

2239
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,800
uh one is about the scope for this

2240
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,239
document

2241
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,880
uh i noticed that uh

2242
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,480
the scope for this document uh includes

2243
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,480
you know the itf natural slice can

2244
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,159
result in uh ancient ad tn

2245
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,199
and

2246
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,760
also about the ietf natural slice

2247
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,199
deployment

2248
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:22,159
i noticed that uh this

2249
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:26,400
has overlapped with bbf tr522

2250
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,440
so

2251
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,960
um

2252
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,159
my proposal is that if atf want to do

2253
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,840
this work uh my proposal is uh

2254
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,719
that itf to send leads onto bbif

2255
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,760
okay and my second question is about the

2256
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,320
solution

2257
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,199
excuse me can you take your provides

2258
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:49,740
matching

2259
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,440
[Music]

2260
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,719
solution

2261
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,679
uh to realize the transport slides

2262
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,040
connected

2263
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,119
with uh

2264
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,639
so if you don't mind taking the rest of

2265
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,239
the questions to the list we're we're

2266
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:03,760
really running overtime and we have a

2267
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,280
couple of other people who want to ask

2268
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,360
questions yeah no and i'll just make a

2269
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,920
comment i won't drag it um remember

2270
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,520
we're not just offering networks license

2271
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,840
to 5g there'll be other access networks

2272
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,000
even broadband and everything else if

2273
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,679
you make it specific if you make it

2274
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,760
specific to 5g

2275
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,119
you'll have to spend another one when we

2276
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,040
start talking wireline other services so

2277
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,360
that's one and this is to me looks like

2278
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,400
a mapping draft not treatment

2279
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,080
so maybe you can indicate somewhere that

2280
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,440
we're doing the map in here but we're

2281
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,639
not telling you how to do network

2282
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,199
slicing inside itf maybe i missed it but

2283
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:37,280
that's that's just comments

2284
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,040
just for you

2285
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,480
okay maybe we can talk thank you

2286
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:43,760
very soon

2287
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,679
uh i've seen many documents who

2288
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,280
underplayed transmission like transport

2289
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,880
network is part of the slicing story so

2290
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,719
this is a good document and i definitely

2291
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:52,800
agree that uh having transportation

2292
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,800
network in the picture and having the

2293
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,159
end to end is implicit is definitely

2294
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,159
very good so i support that okay thank

2295
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,320
you

2296
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,440
thank you very much again

2297
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,919
kristoff

2298
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,519
sir

2299
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,360
hello my name is christoph sarkozy from

2300
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,159
juniper networks on behalf of co-authors

2301
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,199
of the

2302
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,840
draft realization of itf network slices

2303
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,400
for 5g networks using current ipms

2304
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,000
technologies

2305
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,159
i will present our draft so characters

2306
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:31,760
are from orange

2307
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,719
from juniper as well and from orange med

2308
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,440
from telefonica luis and from ribbon

2309
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:42,519
communications event next slide please

2310
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,080
so basically the idea here the overall

2311
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,960
goal and approach was that um

2312
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,040
assess it to what extent atf network

2313
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,040
slash can be implemented using current

2314
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,920
ipms technologies so which means if we

2315
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,360
have current network running and

2316
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,880
operator and the operator would like to

2317
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,800
introduce 5g services on this current

2318
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,199
network with minimal change what the

2319
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,880
operator can do in

2320
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,119
in order to introduce 5g services

2321
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,760
and provide kind of reference document

2322
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,159
kind of blueprint blueprint to

2323
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,760
approaches to the slices with such

2324
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,119
technology so what needs to be

2325
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:16,560
configured what's in video plate

2326
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,560
orchestrated and so on

2327
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,960
and then approach our approaches rather

2328
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,639
than generic climbs

2329
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,560
we pick a specific deployment context

2330
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,760
which is the 5g the s5g is the most most

2331
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,880
promising

2332
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,400
context here for slicing that's the

2333
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,520
reason we pick 5g as an example for that

2334
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,080
next slide

2335
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,600
and because this is concentrating on 5g

2336
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,520
we are using terminology that is using

2337
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,040
the 5g when we convert slicing so run

2338
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,080
cntn so core network transport network

2339
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,520
it means we are talking about transport

2340
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,600
network slicing and when we talk about

2341
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,119
transfer network slices and transfer

2342
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,360
slices we refer to itf network slice

2343
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,119
basically but we are concentrating on

2344
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:01,119
the 5g terminology so in 5g worlds they

2345
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,600
are calling it transport slice

2346
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,159
next slide please

2347
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,000
so what we have in this document so

2348
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,480
first is overview of 5g networking this

2349
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,400
is for for generating you know transport

2350
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,920
engineers to understand more or less

2351
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,639
about 5g a different kind of methods

2352
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,360
between the run cn and transport network

2353
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,440
so how we handle the traffic what is the

2354
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,520
cooperation here between these domains

2355
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,199
to the transport network

2356
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,040
how do we realize the transport of 5g

2357
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,560
slices using current ipmps technologies

2358
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,920
in order you know for brand field

2359
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,920
deployments existing network

2360
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,119
aligning them 5g concept of 5g

2361
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:38,800
deployments with the current deployments

2362
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,400
that we have for example business

2363
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,880
services wholesale smallers that we are

2364
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,280
currently deployed and so on

2365
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,280
then we touch

2366
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,520
very close about the transmitter slicing

2367
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,920
qs models and we defined here the two

2368
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,960
models a 5k aware underwear and 5k of

2369
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,320
our model

2370
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,159
and we talked about capacity planning

2371
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:01,040
management so basically the idea here is

2372
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,159
that we use capacity planning for for a

2373
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:07,920
traffic isolation next slide please

2374
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,199
so we define as well different mapping

2375
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,440
options between the 5g slice and the

2376
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,280
transport slice which is iotf networks

2377
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,040
license mentioned before

2378
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,119
and there could be a couple of options

2379
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:21,440
some examples i provided here so one two

2380
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,840
one mapping one to end mapping so we

2381
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,400
could have one transport slice same that

2382
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,440
serves multiple 5g slices we could have

2383
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,560
some 5g slice that serving you know

2384
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,560
different for the user playing different

2385
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,960
from the control plane and user playing

2386
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,400
control play using different transport

2387
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,760
slices and so on there are a couple of

2388
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,000
modes described in this document

2389
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,719
next night please

2390
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,199
uh then we define as well from the

2391
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:49,119
orchestration perspective we see the

2392
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:50,800
differentiation between the first slides

2393
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,320
being deployed 5g slice and the

2394
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,400
subsequent slices especially for the

2395
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,000
control plane so usually the control

2396
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,199
plane is a

2397
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:00,320
shared among multiple 5g slices next

2398
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,360
slide please

2399
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,480
there's one question okay

2400
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:08,400
a and our higher high level of

2401
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,159
overview of the realization model is

2402
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,960
that we are using very

2403
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,280
granule control on the edge on the

2404
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,119
service delivery points on the

2405
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,800
attachment circuits

2406
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,480
and very you know we graph of course qs

2407
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,560
control in the transport this is to

2408
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,400
align with the current technologies and

2409
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,920
kind of deployment models that used by

2410
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,000
their service providers

2411
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,719
looks like these

2412
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,639
uh we discussed different kind of

2413
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,719
centers as mentioned so at the moment

2414
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,080
the initial version of the draft series

2415
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,320
tribes strap zero we described the

2416
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,960
villain handoff methods and the ip based

2417
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,719
kind of methods by the future versions

2418
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,480
we describe additional handle sensors

2419
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,760
between the run cn domain and the

2420
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,440
transport network domain sorry looks

2421
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,919
like these

2422
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,800
and as discussed we discussed different

2423
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,880
usa models we have mapping models

2424
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,440
basically how to map the qos using the

2425
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,360
5g which is 5ki

2426
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,760
if a 5g

2427
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,800
qs identifier to the qs used in the

2428
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,760
transport network we define two models

2429
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,840
five qi underwear mode which means the

2430
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,000
entire slice is traded as the single

2431
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,280
class from the transport network

2432
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,520
perspective of five key or aware mode

2433
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,719
which means that we have some class

2434
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,960
differentiation in the 5g slice and this

2435
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,560
nice differentiation is reflected in the

2436
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,080
transport network

2437
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,800
next slide please

2438
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,520
and at the end we use capacity planning

2439
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,360
and management so there are a couple of

2440
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,760
schemes can be considered we discuss

2441
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,119
with schemes in data so i will not go

2442
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,960
details because we don't have time

2443
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,239
scheme one is the shortest path

2444
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,159
forwarding so it's basically no traffic

2445
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,400
engineering or eventually some flex algo

2446
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,159
scheme two is traffic engineering with

2447
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,080
fixed path reservations

2448
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,239
um and skin freeze traffic engineering

2449
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:52,880
with a dynamic bandwidth reservations so

2450
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,440
it could be out of bandwidth or dime

2451
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,880
reservation based on the telemetry

2452
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,639
collection and of course additional

2453
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,239
schemes can be considered as well

2454
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,320
and the conclusion so existing atf

2455
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
technologies provide good foundation for

2456
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,960
implementing 5g slicing native domain

2457
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,119
and of course in subsections revisions

2458
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,840
of this draft will expand that

2459
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,520
next steps the questions

2460
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,800
suggestions any comments

2461
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,520
hi it's adrian thank you um for this

2462
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,639
draft which i found a really detailed

2463
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,800
and well-written useful background

2464
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,400
however

2465
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,280
uh i don't think that section three and

2466
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,040
section five

2467
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,280
are ietf

2468
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,800
material

2469
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,600
they're really useful descriptions of

2470
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,239
how 5g works

2471
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,639
but i'm not sure that the ietf is the

2472
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:49,040
place that we should be documenting that

2473
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,639
even as an explainer to the ietf

2474
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:53,520
um

2475
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,199
but section five is the traffic

2476
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,600
engineering is the schemes so maybe you

2477
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,560
you

2478
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,239
you section two section two is

2479
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:02,880
describing the 5g sorry the section

2480
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,639
number's wrong there are two sections

2481
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,239
there's one describing 5g and one

2482
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,880
describing 5g quas

2483
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,239
and those i i i worry you know what

2484
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,679
what's the consequence of them

2485
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:16,800
conflicting with 3gpp and so on okay so

2486
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,679
it feels more like a white paper

2487
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,119
good to publish

2488
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,679
but maybe not here

2489
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,920
the other thing i'd like you to consider

2490
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,520
is that

2491
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,360
using the default nrp is is an approach

2492
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,320
and it's uh it's certainly achievable

2493
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,600
i'd like you to spend some time on

2494
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,159
describing the limitations of that

2495
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,159
approach as well as the benefits okay

2496
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,719
understood yes we are that

2497
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:45,840
thank you

2498
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,320
i agree with adrian is a good document

2499
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,080
but um

2500
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,679
i agree with the adrian is a good

2501
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:52,960
document

2502
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,560
i strongly they suggest that you use the

2503
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,320
terminology that we have in the

2504
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,560
framework i see here transport network

2505
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,560
transfer slides dosing

2506
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,960
we had the lengthy discussion during the

2507
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,920
the adoption of the framework and for

2508
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,159
the specific reason we

2509
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:10,960
we

2510
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,520
don't want to use them so please make

2511
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,600
sure that all the terminology that you

2512
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,480
use is uh confirmed with

2513
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:22,400
that rough thank you thank you

2514
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,840
i think uh i think groove left uh

2515
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,360
they're gonna find this

2516
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,080
so we're i think they were good there

2517
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,159
uh there was a comment in chat about

2518
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:34,639
there's some uh overlap between this and

2519
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:37,600
the previous one exactly yes

2520
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,360
there is separate material so maybe just

2521
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,440
reference rather than

2522
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,879
define all right thank you very much

2523
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,560
hello everyone i will present this draft

2524
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,040
about the data center ability topology

2525
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,080
model

2526
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,639
uh to the one on behalf of john and i'm

2527
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:07,480
so famous authors so next please

2528
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:09,840
well here's the idea is that the service

2529
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,440
providers are deploying more and more

2530
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,719
computing capabilities across the

2531
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,520
network being connected in several

2532
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,960
points of the network sort of attachment

2533
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,440
points and then this relates to

2534
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,520
the data centers or compute capabilities

2535
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,520
of different sizes so we can link this

2536
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,600
with the edge computing story or much

2537
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,639
more centralized data centers so the the

2538
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,080
the problem that we try to address is

2539
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,000
that the the fact that it could become

2540
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,480
interesting to have a joint topological

2541
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,480
view of the network

2542
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,719
plus the the compute capabilities being

2543
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:39,920
connected on

2544
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,920
across the network right so in such a

2545
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,760
way that we could assist on the traffic

2546
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,800
engineering decisions once we need

2547
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,520
resources in the compute site

2548
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,760
so here what we do is to follow a

2549
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,920
similar approach to the one that was

2550
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,159
followed in a

2551
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,840
another working group document which is

2552
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,520
the service function aware topology

2553
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,360
model so essentially

2554
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,679
moving from the service function ideas

2555
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,199
to the resource idea of the compute

2556
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:10,960
capabilities so um the the purpose here

2557
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,119
is to describe um

2558
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,960
complete capabilities and maybe in two

2559
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,040
manners this is uh some work in progress

2560
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,199
so we need to to see if this uh

2561
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,520
consistent to to go in one direction or

2562
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,080
in another direction or both of them so

2563
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,800
one approach would be to uh describe

2564
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,610
the resources

2565
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:28,960
[Music]

2566
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,080
i mean

2567
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,520
to describe the data the compute

2568
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,080
capabilities in terms of resource

2569
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,719
capabilities such as cpu memory storage

2570
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,679
and so on so far or alternatively to

2571
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,679
describe them in terms of resource

2572
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:44,800
bundles which is usually no then known

2573
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,560
as quotas

2574
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,000
here for instance we we follow an

2575
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,520
example in the draft

2576
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,239
which is being elaborated in the cntt

2577
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,480
initiative as a cloud infrastructure

2578
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,880
telco tax force which is

2579
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,320
a joint initiative between the linux

2580
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,639
foundation and gsma just

2581
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:02,080
as an example

2582
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,960
so next please

2583
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:07,280
so for instance in this initiative they

2584
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,560
they are proposing different flavors and

2585
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,480
they consider predefined flavors as the

2586
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,320
ones that you can see the table but they

2587
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,119
also open the door to

2588
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:20,400
define customize customize flavors so

2589
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,880
somehow what we try to reflect here is

2590
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,599
uh

2591
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:25,360
these possibilities so going to the

2592
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,679
either the raw resources or either going

2593
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,920
in these ideas or of flavors and so we

2594
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,639
will try to adapt the model to these two

2595
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,719
approaches by now

2596
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:39,520
so next please

2597
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,520
so as a summary this step was already

2598
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,000
presented in itf 109

2599
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,119
versions 2 and 1 and 2 essentially

2600
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,520
provided updates on on the model on the

2601
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,840
the id of the these compute flavors this

2602
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,639
is

2603
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:54,239
also because the

2604
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:55,679
the definition on these alternatives

2605
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:58,000
that the cntt and so are

2606
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,280
moving forward

2607
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,159
so

2608
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:02,000
so how we are adapting to these new

2609
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,280
definitions

2610
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,599
so as next steps

2611
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,080
uh we would like to

2612
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,599
to adapt the model to the different ways

2613
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:12,080
of exposing data center capabilities

2614
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,239
uh this includes also different kind of

2615
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,599
technologies for instance the example

2616
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,400
that i saw before was uh

2617
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,199
defined in relationship with openstack

2618
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,840
in dc cnt initiative but there will be

2619
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,920
other ways maybe of expressing resources

2620
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,000
with other approaches like kubernetes

2621
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:28,960
and so

2622
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,960
so our objective will be also to work on

2623
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,040
the young modules accompanying

2624
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,080
the model

2625
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,239
and also probably to start including

2626
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:37,119
some

2627
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,599
examples on cases that could better

2628
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:41,599
reflect the

2629
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,360
the the possibilities of of this

2630
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,159
approach we are considering for instance

2631
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:48,400
start modeling the what could be a case

2632
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,480
for upf or

2633
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,960
things like that or or thinking on the

2634
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,560
segregated radio as well they see you

2635
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,800
and and so that could be examples of

2636
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,440
applicability of this model so uh just

2637
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,599
for finishing any feedback or any

2638
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:03,199
comment is more than welcome and that's

2639
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:06,919
all from my side thank you

2640
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,520
okay

2641
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,000
is greg in the room

2642
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,320
okay uh i don't see the presenter for

2643
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,040
this unless uh sampath are you gonna

2644
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,840
present someone just came into you

2645
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,599
all right we're gonna try to go back to

2646
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:46,800
bo

2647
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,679
uh

2648
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:48,400
so

2649
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,000
uh that was

2650
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,920
uh bo can you check your audio while i

2651
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,360
find your slides

2652
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,598
please

2653
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,880
okay

2654
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,639
can you hear me now

2655
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,080
is this better

2656
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,080
it sounds okay why don't we give it a

2657
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,400
shot

2658
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,320
did i get the wrong one i got the wrong

2659
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:12,360
one sorry hold on

2660
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,400
okay i try to be quick

2661
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,840
uh thanks everyone uh

2662
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,080
i'm going uh this draft has been

2663
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,800
presented several times and this time

2664
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,040
i'm going to give some updates on this

2665
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,440
draft

2666
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:41,440
and since uh last

2667
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,480
idea meet the working group has adopted

2668
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,760
the two new nrp related

2669
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:48,960
drafts

2670
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,480
and so

2671
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,320
when we had this

2672
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,159
tariq just mentioned we had some

2673
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,760
discussion

2674
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,960
with nrp modeling and

2675
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,080
things uh still uh the

2676
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,599
unless framework

2677
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:07,280
gives some general nrp definition we we

2678
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,239
still think that uh nrp modeling needs

2679
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,960
more uh like

2680
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,800
detailed uh

2681
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,239
definition

2682
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,239
like here uh

2683
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:19,280
we give

2684
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,800
we try to summarize some k components

2685
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,159
from uh

2686
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:28,320
the two new adopted drafts one is from

2687
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,040
an srpm plus uh

2688
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,800
uh like

2689
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,920
things there are so many uh new uh

2690
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:39,440
terminology in this draft we try to uh

2691
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,159
find some common

2692
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,840
uh components

2693
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,159
uh that also in the

2694
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:49,520
uh enough scalability drugs so here we

2695
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,880
think like

2696
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,760
nrp partition mode is quite useful to

2697
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,119
define different partition types

2698
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:00,560
and also an rp control plane

2699
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:05,280
in unless ipmps they define rpte

2700
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,159
but in rp scalability they also define

2701
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:11,199
some distributed control plane like

2702
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:14,960
multi topology and also flexago

2703
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,920
these uh distributed control plane can

2704
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,080
also be supported

2705
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,199
and about the data plane uh nrp data

2706
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,159
plane

2707
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:27,360
uh uh unless ipmp has defined uh data

2708
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:30,320
plane selector and phb

2709
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,599
uh but enough scalability defines like

2710
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,599
an rpid

2711
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,239
for the data plane so

2712
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,320
here uh

2713
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,320
we try to summarize the requirements and

2714
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,199
and

2715
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:47,599
like to ask

2716
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:50,639
the comments and feedbacks from others

2717
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:52,880
and to see whether we have some good

2718
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,840
summarization here

2719
01:54:57,119 --> 01:55:00,960
and about this model uh usage we try to

2720
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,840
align with a nice framework definition

2721
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,320
this uh nrp model belongs to network

2722
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:10,159
configuration interface model

2723
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:16,000
and then uh about this nappy topology uh

2724
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,159
these the terms we try to uh

2725
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:23,599
borrow from unless ipmps network

2726
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,280
because right now

2727
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,400
there's no uh

2728
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,119
there is a need like whether there this

2729
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:34,159
nlp topology needs to be defined

2730
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:35,920
uh

2731
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,119
like in tariq just mentioned uh

2732
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,520
we have the

2733
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,199
filter ways to define a filter topology

2734
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:46,719
but

2735
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:47,760
we

2736
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,239
since we reading from the framework

2737
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:53,119
dropped we feel that there is a another

2738
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,280
customized way that

2739
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,000
we can select specific links from the

2740
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,080
underly network

2741
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:00,960
here

2742
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,280
on the right hand i showed a

2743
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,880
a model strap

2744
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,840
just a snip from the model that you can

2745
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,679
see that

2746
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:12,800
how that

2747
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,040
mod topology can be

2748
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,560
set up

2749
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,400
instead of using the filter rules

2750
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,440
so

2751
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,719
that's the main update from the last itf

2752
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,719
meeting

2753
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,480
then

2754
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,880
here is a summary

2755
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,560
of the way you think about the nrp model

2756
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,800
component the major components

2757
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:44,159
like for the foot

2758
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:47,119
basically we feel the nrp model should

2759
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,840
cover both an rp configuration and also

2760
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,679
not monitoring

2761
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,239
and for configuration

2762
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:57,520
we can choose to decide whether this is

2763
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,679
a control plane partition or it's a data

2764
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,599
plane partition

2765
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,040
and then

2766
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,920
about the topology uh what's that's

2767
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,440
already in the ns framework definition

2768
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:12,880
and i think resource reservation uh

2769
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,440
nrp policy also had this

2770
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:18,639
uh but enough control planes seems

2771
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,880
missing in nrp policy

2772
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:21,679
so

2773
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:24,719
we think this is a

2774
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:27,119
at this stage we think this is a summary

2775
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,960
of the the major components

2776
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,520
uh

2777
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,719
i think

2778
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:35,599
and

2779
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:39,199
and then it's enough monitoring and

2780
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:42,239
uh basically uh tarek also means

2781
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:44,080
mentioned that we

2782
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,840
right now we we are still in the

2783
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,159
discussion and since

2784
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:51,599
uh this model and nrp policy model they

2785
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,920
have many uh comments

2786
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,320
so we still

2787
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,679
i think

2788
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,119
at this time we

2789
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:01,040
we need more discussion to march two

2790
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,480
drafts

2791
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,920
so

2792
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,040
and uh

2793
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,760
and but we like to hear more uh comments

2794
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,760
and reviews from working group to give

2795
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,239
us uh like suggestion on the nlp

2796
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:16,960
modeling requirements part

2797
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,760
that's all thank you

2798
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,599
any comments questions

2799
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:29,040
so uh you commented uh about having some

2800
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,840
relationship with the um the draft that

2801
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,440
the policy draft

2802
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,920
it seems that there needs to be a really

2803
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:38,480
tight alignment between the two drafts

2804
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,080
because they're effectively uh

2805
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,280
controlling the same thing from

2806
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,639
different perspectives

2807
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:44,960
or different locations um what are your

2808
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,360
thoughts on that

2809
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:52,239
i think right now uh we haven't uh have

2810
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:55,119
the like conclusion yet but

2811
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:58,080
uh like from our side we think that most

2812
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,119
of the

2813
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:01,280
the components are quite common like

2814
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,480
data playing

2815
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,719
uh identifier and and all those

2816
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:07,920
components so

2817
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:09,679
all right so

2818
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:11,920
yeah oh go ahead go ahead

2819
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,800
uh yeah we think we need to merge

2820
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:18,000
into a one drop but uh keeping like a

2821
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,199
filter

2822
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:22,000
or customized way as different options

2823
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:22,800
so

2824
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,960
like we can cover a

2825
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,639
different

2826
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,560
topology

2827
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,560
creation

2828
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,480
uh options but uh

2829
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,599
but that's what i think yeah merging

2830
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:40,560
sounds quite sensible uh thank you

2831
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,000
okay thank you

2832
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,119
um

2833
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,000
i think greg is not in a thanks book um

2834
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
i think thanks to greg you get one

2835
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,280
minute back

2836
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,400
uh

2837
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,320
thanks everyone for a great session uh

2838
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,360
see you all in london thank you

2839
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:58,679
thanks everyone

2840
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,239
thank you all

2841
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,760
uh

2842
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:32,199
we
