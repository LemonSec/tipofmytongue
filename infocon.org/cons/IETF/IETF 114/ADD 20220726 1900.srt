16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
to be co-chairing the deprived half of

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,799
the session so

18
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
you want to explain why you're not

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
sitting up here or whether

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240

ah

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
session up

28
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,719

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,879
queue

31
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
oh that's right

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,599

right though so i can handle that

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
so i do it all from

36
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
back over boom boom

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200

i don't have chair power so i yeah this

44
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,840
would have gone a little bit more

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,560
smoothly if

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
i was already logged into data tracker

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,990
um

70
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,170
[Music]

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,759
finally we are in okay

72
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
request browser conditions

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
complete

74
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
okay

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,039
and then we have where is our

76
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,759
chat queue

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,919
oh now we can do the presentation view

78
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,919
right

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
yes please go eric uh welcome to our

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
area director eric who will

81
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
uh has a very short presentation on some

82
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,280
new plans in the

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,840
itfdns

84
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,440
space so i prepared some slides they

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
will be into the materials but it's

86
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,039
basically three slides explaining that

87
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,759
more and more draft are relying on dns

88
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,280
team was kind enough to make some

89
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,560
statistics

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
if not mistaken there were about 59

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
draft that were using the word dns in

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
the title or in the abstract so there

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
are way more

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,319
documents

95
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,240
using dns than one identify my team

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,720
some of them are from this group from

97
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
deep drive dns op

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
or

99
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,360
add of course right and

100
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
basically

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
those people in those working group

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
understand dns so like no problem

103
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
but there are many more working groups

104
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,759
relying on dns and i'm not sure

105
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
about the knowledge of dns

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
so that would

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
i mean

108
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
you have review draft

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
claiming dns protocol or dns

110
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,800
infrastructure and doing very strange

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
thing with this

112
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
so the point

113
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
of doing again the dns directorate

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
and it's a decision by the isg

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
the led the nssd d prive

116
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
and dns up shares

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
is basically to allow early review

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
so when

119
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,599
a working group has got a dash 0 0

120
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,280
that has been adopted

121
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
they can request an early review

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
of their draft

123
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
pretty much like the young doctors

124
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
right but having something called dns

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
doctors

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
does not look very nice so we call it

127
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,360
the next directorate right simply

128
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
so it will be created shortly after this

129
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
iitf meeting

130
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
warren

131
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
and myself

132
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
will be sending an email

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
asking for volunteers you can go to the

134
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,000
last slide would be superb

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
that's basically the statistics done by

136
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
tim

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,639
so the next step is really

138
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,120
around august i am sending and one will

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
be sending for dns up an email asking

140
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
for volunteers for the reviewers

141
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,639
and

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
the goal for us would be to get a very

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
experienced reviewers

144
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,520
as well as

145
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
less experienced reviewer but they are

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
eager to learn about what is the review

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
task and basically become maybe

148
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,679
more than a reviewer later right

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
the goal of the isg is really to get a

150
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,839
pipeline of talents right to get

151
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,240
from lurkers to authors reviewers

152
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
shepherds

153
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
chairs or whatever and becoming a doieb

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
member

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
so that's really important to get this

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,360
balance

157
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
we are also looking for two directorate

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
secretaries

159
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
that are basically the person assigning

160
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
reviews to the people

161
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,399
so that's again we will be sending this

162
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,959
before end of august most probably

163
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,240
so thank you in advance for stepping

164
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
forward on this and i'll give you the

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
flow

166
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,959
well uh

167
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
we'll go back just one go back one slide

168
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
tim i should have sent this 3d kg this

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
was just a sample of what's kind of

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
driving this all of how dns cross-cuts

171
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,279
so many different groups

172
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,320
yeah

173
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,240
so so this is anacond gilmore uh aclu so

174
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
i appreciate this work the attempt to

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
try to um

176
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
provide an overview from the dns point

177
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
of view but i'm also not sure that i

178
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
know that there is a dns point of view

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,519
um say a point so i'm wondering do you

180
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
do you have a uh like any sort of rubric

181
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
that you would expect reviewers to use i

182
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
mean are we talking about like

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,760
i run resolvers within my organization

184
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
and i want to make sure this draft

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
doesn't screw them up i'm responsible

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
for the authoritative zone i'm thinking

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
about things architecturally i'm worried

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
about

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
cryptographic processes i'm worried

190
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
about udp limits like there's a whole

191
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
range of different things to think about

192
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
do you have a way to tell us if if

193
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
anybody wants to volunteer for this what

194
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
they should be looking for because

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,279
people might be experiencing one thing

196
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,959
and not another

197
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
and that's a fair point again

198
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
so as usual right the perfect is admin

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,480
of the good

200
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
right so any review early stage is

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
better than something at the isg level

202
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
later so

203
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
even if not perfect it would be nice but

204
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,920
i think that they're asking for the

205
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
secretary of this dns directorate they

206
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,519
know

207
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,399
the experience of all the reviewers

208
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,120
and if they quickly look at the abstract

209
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
of the the id they could select the

210
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
right person

211
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
that could be one way of doing it but

212
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
honestly if we don't try we will never

213
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
know

214
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
that's basically it thank you that's a

215
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,839
good point yeah jim reid please

216
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,079
sorry yeah we have uh two more in queue

217
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
right now

218
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
james speaking

219
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
solely for myself

220
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
eric for the members of this direct eric

221
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,959
so my name's jim reed sorry if people

222
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,320
didn't pick me up in the mic there

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
speaking for myself

224
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,200
and the plans for the members of this

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
directorate and the secretariat function

226
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
that you were talking about here they

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
expect to go through all of the

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
submitted drafts to look for dns related

229
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
content or those that are putting dns

230
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
related content in the draft speak

231
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
specified to notify the director of the

232
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
secretariat thing you're talking about

233
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
what is it going to be

234
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
so the rules and the procedures

235
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
will still need to be

236
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
refined

237
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
right and the experience will tell but

238
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,040
the expectation is really to the other

239
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
working group shares

240
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
right no team and the brand of the world

241
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,040
but somebody doing young models right

242
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,160
yeah that would talk about it oh maybe

243
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
there is dns content i know i will

244
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
request a review okay thank you okay yes

245
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
it's endless story

246
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
thank you paul hoffman please

247
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
well hoffman so i'm a little bit

248
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,959
concerned but you have time to allay my

249
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
concern i am concerned that one of the

250
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
reviews one of the early reviews is

251
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,800
going to come back to a working group

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
saying don't do that in the dns or

253
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
you're doing it wrong is that actually

254
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
since some people will say don't do into

255
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,279
dns a different reviewer would say

256
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
that's just fine or whatever

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
how are you gonna i mean it's fine to

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,480
say a for review to say oh you got this

259
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,959
a little bit wrong but there's half the

260
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
people in this room are don't do it in

261
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
the dns the other people are like ooh

262
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
cool a new new thing in the dns

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
yeah but if only the goal of the

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
directorate would be to block early to

265
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,639
drive that we're doing bad thing i would

266
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
declare success okay

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
thank you this time the queue is empty

268
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,760
yes thank you eric

269
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
so as a reminder since we got a little

270
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
bit of a late start thanks to the clown

271
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
show that was going on up here um i will

272
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
just really blow through our slides

273
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
really quickly as far as the chair

274
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,639
slides go you're all familiar with the

275
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,120
no well by now if you're not then please

276
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
look it up separately because i'm not

277
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,079
giving you enough time to read it here

278
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,360
um

279
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,839
it is the standard ietf noel the one

280
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,600
thing that we've been asked to emphasize

281
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
though and you know looks like we have

282
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
pretty high compliance rate in here but

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
in a meeting room you it is a

284
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
requirement of the conference that you

shepherding of andrew and then very

321
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
thorough iesg

322
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
looks at it there are a few discussed

323
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,800
items that are outstanding

324
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
i

325
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
don't remember off the top of my head

326
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
which ones i think it's for ddr

327
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
um glenn please comment in chat if you

328
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
wanted to make any special additional

329
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,199
comments about that

330
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
um

331
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
i'm being told the volume's a bit low

332
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,079
but that might be because my face is not

333
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,000
adequately in the microphone

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,199
um

335
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,440
and so the status right now though is

336
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
really solid for uh these documents that

337
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,399
are uh in iesg review and are expected

338
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,920
to move forward to publication

339
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
imminently

340
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
or rather they go to off 48 of course

341
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
for per process but

342
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,360
we expect approval for eventual

343
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
eventual

344
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
publishing as an rfc

345
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
then um

346
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
here's the timeline i'm not sure glenn

347
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
please comment in chat and i'll be happy

348
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
to relay it to the microphone what you

349
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
wanted to observe about this particular

350
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
document other than

351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,519
that it is a draft that the working

352
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
group has adopted

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
and i will just wait for

354
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
glenn if you want to make any additional

355
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
comment here

356
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
oh they have slides so we're going to be

357
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
doing a presentation for that

358
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,320
the dns resolver information draft

359
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
oh eric points out that the service

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
speed document is also clear of all

361
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,399
discuss and so it is essentially through

362
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
iesg

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,839
at this point

364
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,759
and uh so here again our current drafts

365
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
uh ben has another draft that is not

366
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
gone through uh ietf adoption call yet

367
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,839
but i expect we're moving in that

368
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
direction right um

369
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,800
oh ben will comment on that i i just

370
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
wanted to correct that this this

371
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
document is uh is a document that went

372
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
through a working group adoption call

373
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
and did not get adopted it it failed the

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,360
uh adoption quality right here in add

375
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,160
uh

376
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
and uh and and this session we are

377
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,639
presenting it again it has been

378
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
substantially changed incorporating a

379
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
lot of feedback and uh i believe chris

380
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
chris box will be uh going through the

381
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
details of them right and i apologize um

382
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,559
for having ill prepared myself to speak

383
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,679
to that

384
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,799
uh the

385
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,319
glenn's inability to be here kind of

386
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
really threw a curveball at us all uh

387
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
however i believe we are ready then to

388
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,039
move on to

389
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
our first presentation

390
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
which is going to be on

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
uh

392
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,119
do you have the agenda i don't know that

393
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,039
the slides are in order is the thing

394
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
okay it's a split horizon one

395
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
and this is uh dan wing are you

396
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,678
presenting

397
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,799
dan is uh miked in if um from remote

398
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,039
do you want to drive your own slides

399
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
sir

400
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
yeah if you share them and give me

401
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
control that would work out great

402
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,200
right uh okay

403
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,720
lovely

404
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
um

405
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
how do i pass control to you

406
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
okay i have to stop sharing

407
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
okay that's what i thought

408
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
that's fine too

409
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
oh past slides control look at that

410
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
there we

411
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,520
go it's like fourth or fifth item down

412
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
on the list

413
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,960
okay

414
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,799
i think i got the right there you go

415
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,600
great take it away dan cool

416
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,360
um i'm dan wing uh this is uh the split

417
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,919
horizon authority uh it just became a

418
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
zero zero for the working group

419
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,360
um

420
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
in this uh

421
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
so as we transition this from individual

422
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
to uh working group draft uh we

423
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
introduced uh and and refined the term

424
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
split horizon dns and validated split

425
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,320
horizon they have kind of the obvious

426
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
meaning but we'll touch on them briefly

427
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
updated the scope um

428
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,600
talked about how to use a

429
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
pre-pre-configured external resolver in

430
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
dns and have a little bit of detail on

431
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,679
that and how we are avoiding leaking the

432
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
internal data domains to external

433
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
resolvers which was a concern that came

434
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,320
up

435
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
early on

436
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,240
so

437
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
terminology

438
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,280
split horizon dns is where

439
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
we are

440
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,440
forking off a different view of what the

441
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
dns is from

442
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,240
for internal use or for non-public use

443
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
and then what what is uh on the public

444
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,000
dns

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
um it's been around for a long time uh

446
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
frequently frowned upon

447
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,919
but this seems to be the closest

448
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,960
definition closest concise definition

449
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
that we could reach in the document so

450
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
far

451
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
and then validated split horizon is the

452
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
thing this draft is mostly concerning

453
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
itself with which is

454
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
make sure that when there is a split

455
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
horizon the owner of the domain the

456
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
public owner of the domain

457
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,120
feels that this split is legitimate

458
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
so this is what prevents this draft from

459
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,799
being useful for filtering and this has

460
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,280
been some confusion with earlier

461
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
versions of this that because split

462
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
horizon

463
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
and rpz

464
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
are both kind of used today

465
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
as mechanisms to achieve

466
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,600
uh filtering

467
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
this draft does not help with

468
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
towards those ends the validated split

469
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
horizon uses either dns sec or querying

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
a public resolver to determine that the

471
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,320
split is authorized by the domain owner

472
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,799
so that helps constrain our scope of

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,120
course which is has been our goal in the

474
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,919
draft for a while um but again it's uh

475
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
refined a little bit in this version so

476
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
we're allowing the domain owner to

477
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
authorize a split horizon view of their

478
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,799
domain

479
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,400
so it's useful

480
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,919
everywhere that

481
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,400
this might be needed so for home

482
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
networks enterprise networks service

483
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
providers especially mobile service

484
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,440
providers

485
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
interested in this sort of thing

486
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
um and that there's no prior

487
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,880
configuration of the end point that a uh

488
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,200
domain hint was authorized it can all be

489
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,440
checked by doing the dns sect check like

490
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,039
i said or the

491
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,159
public

492
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
dns check the public

493
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
resolver check

494
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,559
as i discussed

495
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,600
um

496
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
so these are the the steps what's in

497
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,840
blue so this is not changed but this is

498
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
just an overview what's in blue are how

499
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,919
things are learned so this is not unique

500
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,720
or or introduced by this draft what is

501
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,799
uh unique and and introduced by this

502
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,360
draft is what's in green so that's where

503
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
we connect to

504
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
the cl the name server that claims uh to

505
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,640
own this split horizon and verify that

506
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
it's been authorized by talking with

507
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
directly with it

508
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
and those that and some steps operated

509
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
uh on the client are how we achieve that

510
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
verification that it's an authorized

511
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,159
split of dns

512
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,679
and this is something

513
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,760
probably want the working group to touch

514
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,320
on or to you know folks to kind of

515
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
highlight to review because we we've

516
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,240
kind of

517
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
moved around on this text a couple of

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
times

519
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
um

520
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,280
and that's uh how how to best

521
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,679
word this as a must-not is what we have

522
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,120
in there right now

523
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,039
but we've had a couple of comments on

524
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,159
that

525
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,720
exactly how to work this is

526
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,280
how to do the dns sect validation in a

527
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
way that doesn't weaken anything when

528
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
we're trying to validate the the split

529
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
horizon

530
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,200
this kind of touches into you know

531
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
captive portal can't do dns tech

532
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,120
validation quite yet when we're trying

533
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,240
to do this split horizon validation

534
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
oftentimes we are in a captive portal

535
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
situation so when that when that gets

536
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,039
triggered and when we can start doing

537
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,080
the local dns sec validation uh and when

538
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
we're out of captive portal uh turns

539
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,280
into an interesting uh timing issue

540
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
that i think we would want to touch on

541
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
and get some further feedback on from

542
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
the working group

543
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,159
and

544
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,600
read this section of the draft

545
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,000
and an important point some of the

546
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
review comments early on i think we've

547
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
resolved these completely now

548
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,240
but to not leak internal domain names

549
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,960
so we do

550
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,360
leak out to the public resolver if the

551
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,840
public resolver is queried that you have

552
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,679
an internal you know split horizon you

553
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,520
know

554
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,000
internal.example.com or

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,520
corp.example.com or whatever that is but

556
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,559
we don't leak out the internal host name

557
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,159
so the super secret hostname of www we

558
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
don't leak that out

559
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,000
or the super secret hostname of

560
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
mail.internal.uh

561
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
example.com we don't leak out the mail

562
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,840
the hostname portion of that

563
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,520
um some uh

564
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,000
there's some interest in keeping that uh

565
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
internal you know not not leaking that

566
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
out and and to be clear we're not

567
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,919
leaking out that hosting but we do leak

568
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,080
out if we are

569
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,520
triggering off of that zone name so the

570
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
internal dot

571
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
example.com

572
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
uh and that's where we are with zero

573
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,720
zero again mostly uh tying things up

574
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,039
from the individual draft to

575
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
the first working group iteration of

576
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
this document

577
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
so are there any comments questions

578
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,840
the queue is open please

579
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,760
uh ben schwartz please

580
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,640
hi ben schwartz uh i'm uh one of the one

581
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
of the listed authors here

582
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
uh

583
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
this uh i think the

584
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,080
my real my big question here is is

585
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,720
really what changes do people want

586
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
uh you know this draft is in my view

587
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
self-consistent

588
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,960
uh you know implementable as written

589
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
and

590
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,320
uh and so you know we're in the working

591
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
group but uh you know there's no reason

592
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,039
to stay in the working group unless and

593
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,720
you know no reason to delay a last call

594
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
unless there are changes that people

595
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
want and it you know from the discussion

596
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
during adoption it does sound like there

597
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,480
are

598
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,679
there were some people who felt the

599
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,880
changes were were needed so

600
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,760
i'd like to to hear those concerns and

601
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
and you know see if we can get moving on

602
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,640
them

603
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
i want to point out

604
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,039
that

605
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,600
uh earlier revisions of this draft said

606
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
something very specific about

607
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
provisioning domains and so to anybody

608
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
who thinks that who's still thinking

609
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,559
about this in those terms the draft has

610
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,240
evolved somewhat and

611
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
at this point uh talks very generally

612
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
about the idea of a local domain hint

613
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
and there are all sorts of different

614
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
ways that your local network might

615
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,440
tell you hey

616
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
i want you to give special treatment to

617
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,360
this particular domain name

618
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,320
and and this draft claims to

619
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,039
be

620
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,679
suitable for all of those including some

621
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
dhcp options for example so if your

622
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,000
network uses dhcp it's

623
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
at least in principle possible to use

624
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,720
this mechanism in that kind of network

625
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,720
thank you ben andrew kampling please

626
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,760
i am all right i i just want to say i

627
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,000
thought the the draft is good and it

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,159
solves an important problem

629
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,880
so

630
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
unless anyone else has any substantive

631
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,640
comments it'd be good to see it move to

632
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
last call sooner or later if we can

633
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,679
thank you andrew

634
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
tommy paulie

635
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
hello uh thanks for the document um

636
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
i think one thing would be good before

637
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
we move immediately to last call since

638
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
it's quite new be good to also see

639
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
some implementation deployment

640
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,679
experience in some networks that are

641
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,120
doing this um

642
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,840
the question i had looking through this

643
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
when we're talking about

644
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,080
validating

645
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
the

646
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,159
kind of the authority over the hints

647
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,600
one of the requirements it has in there

648
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,559
is that essentially you either doing dnr

649
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,679
on your network or you have like v2

650
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
other types of split domains um

651
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,600
is that

652
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
is that a strict requirement like

653
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
essentially i'm wondering like

654
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,120
when we're asking someone to be able to

655
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,559
do this because there are lots of

656
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,919
scenarios where

657
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
our devices are in split dns

658
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,919
environments um

659
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,760
are we saying like you must always

660
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,840
upgrade to dnr before this is really

661
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
viable are there other things that could

662
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
be done like

663
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
like is you know is some setup of ddr

664
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,760
okay or like is there something else

665
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,440
that is a sufficient hit to upgrade

666
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
uh

667
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
so uh ben schwartz uh

668
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,039
the the restriction to dnr and not ddr

669
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,880
is because dnr gives us a unique

670
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
hostname

671
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,440
to identify the resolver ddr does not

672
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
provide us with a unique hostname

673
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,919
it does provide us with a valid

674
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,159
certificate that contains

675
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
zero or more host names uh if the if

676
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,399
that certificate contains one or more

677
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,000
host names then you could potentially

678
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
use a mechanism essentially just like

679
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,799
this but it would require you to do this

680
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,279
thing do this slightly odd dance of

681
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,880
connecting to the server getting a

682
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
certificate back and then

683
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
iterating over the list of names that

684
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,799
are in the certificate and processing

685
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,600
them

686
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,279
through uh checking them against this

687
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
list looking for a match and so it's a

688
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,200
very unusual mode of certificate

689
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,039
validation and for that reason we didn't

690
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
specify it but it can be done securely

691
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,600
so if you think it's worth pursuing then

692
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
that's something that we can certainly

693
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
push on

694
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
yeah i think that's kind of the main

695
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
feedback i

696
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
would like to see because like yes i get

697
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,399
that it is far uglier and it involves

698
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,480
more steps on the client however

699
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
i'm thinking you know this is super

700
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,399
useful for enterprise deployments

701
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,080
where i imagine it will be far easier to

702
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
do some of the updates on the back end

703
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
to make it possible to do this

704
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,600
validation

705
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
and some of their equipment you know

706
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,320
waiting for that hardware to support dnr

707
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,279
is going to take a lot longer so

708
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
in the meantime having

709
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,679
a dance the client can do that takes

710
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,679
longer but still works is going to be

711
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,559
very very helpful

712
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
thank you tommy and ben i believe that's

713
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,679
it dan i had a notification that

714
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,520
somebody was joining the queue but i

715
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,559
think they misclicked on their phone so

716
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,840
yeah

717
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,039
thanks everybody

718
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,840
yes thank you dan

719
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,880
okay

720
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,919
next ahmed is a brief presentation on

721
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,000
the resolver info

722
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,399
draft

723
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
thank you

724
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,320
yeah so this will be i would say um a

725
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
quick presentation of the um the recent

726
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,399
update we have on this draft so please

727
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,678
if you can move to the next slide

728
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,919
so in in this slides we have a summary

729
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,840
of what we have in the uh during the

730
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,200
last 80s meetings so this is the um

731
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,120
we shortened the list of the attributes

732
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,960
we are currently

733
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
advertising for the reservoir so we have

734
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,799
something which is really very

735
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,600
restrict and limited

736
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,840
we also constrained some of the

737
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,159
attributes that was already defined in

738
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,519
the draft so that we have some i would

739
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,440
say which is mainly used for the

740
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
diagnostics that it can be exposed not

741
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,240
not exposed directly to the to the users

742
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,919
and the last modification and the

743
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,279
importance that we made is that we

744
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,840
stretch the validations that we

745
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,519
we are um

746
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
requiring for some of the consumption of

747
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
the of the attributes

748
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,360
next slide please

749
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,320
so

750
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,760
this is basically for us i think as we

751
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,279
uh as authors we think that the the

752
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
document is um i would say in a stable

753
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,399
state and we would like to um

754
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,120
to proceed with the uh the um i call for

755
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
adoption for for for this document

756
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
especially because this i would say meet

757
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,679
one of the started item we have on the

758
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,039
in this working group which is

759
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,120
explicitly shorter to provide them a

760
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,840
solution for i would say the discovery

761
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,279
of the information of the reservoir

762
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,640
information

763
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,399
um so

764
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,200
and we are another item is that we are

765
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,039
using this solution for another solution

766
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,960
we have in another working group to

767
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
restrict some of the

768
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,360
options we are using for the uh

769
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,880
destructured

770
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
errors that we are providing to the

771
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,360
customers so there is this i would say

772
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
um

773
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
a clear need for this solution to

774
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
provide the two um one of the shorter

775
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
items for the add working group but also

776
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,200
for other use cases and we think that

777
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
the document the document provides

778
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,559
straightforward solutions and you would

779
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
like to yeah so that the working of

780
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,640
consider the id adoption and that's it

781
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,880
yeah okay

782
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,200
thank you very much

783
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
uh the queue is open for feedback

784
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,919
hi punitsud from google public dns

785
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,799
so

786
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
the general structure looks fine i have

787
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
one question and

788
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
one suggestion on the format so the main

789
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,840
question is i skim through the list to

790
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
see

791
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,960
the discussion and it's mostly the

792
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
authors and

793
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,120
benchmarks i have not seen interest from

794
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
implementers so i'm curious if there are

795
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
client-side implementers who are willing

796
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,360
to implement this protocol

797
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,279
yes

798
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,679
at least for my knowledge i am not an

799
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,080
implement i don't have i would say a

800
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,159
client in which we we will implement

801
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,720
this we are more on the network side so

802
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,159
this is the equation for the working

803
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,679
group so if there are implementers that

804
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,200
are interested to have this this feature

805
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,080
it's up to them to uh to disclose yeah

806
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
okay yeah because i would like to see

807
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,880
some implementer interest before the

808
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,279
this draft is uh

809
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,799
taken on board by the working group

810
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,919
uh

811
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,600
the other it's a suggestion uh the

812
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,760
the format of the resinfo

813
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
has like a

814
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,480
x string for a bunch of dns options i

815
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,040
would suggest it will be easier and more

816
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,159
compact

817
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
to basically use the numeric codes for

818
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,000
the eds zero options instead of trying

819
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,079
to encode them as text so you could just

820
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,320
have one field which says here's all the

821
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,239
edns zero options

822
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,079
the resolver supports

823
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
and then you don't need any iana support

824
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,159
for doing that yeah this is something

825
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,520
which is workable once we have i would

826
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,599
say the draft adopted and so on so

827
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,800
that's yeah and that's a comment

828
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,839
sorry i didn't mean to distract you it

829
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,839
was a quick chair sidebar

830
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
um but there is nobody else in the queue

831
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,199
uh last last call

832
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,638
except not that kind of last call

833
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,000
thank you very much okay

834
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
and now uh ben i imagine are you coming

835
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,160
up for oh okay

836
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,400
one moment while i get the slides up

837
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,440
uh no uh

838
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,320
right

839
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,599
is that true

840
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
you're not required

841
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
so are you sharing

842
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,720
yes we have no magic clicker so um you

843
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
just go ahead

844
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,839
and

845
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,280
this is the

846
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,160
um

847
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,920
verified selection of the option right

848
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,280
yes so you have to tell me though when

849
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,920
you need to advance okay

850
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,920
hi everyone um so as ben mentioned uh

851
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,680
there is a new revision of this draft

852
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,760
was posted two weeks ago

853
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,119
um

854
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,280
it's got a new name so it's now called

855
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
reputation verified selection of

856
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,320
upstream encrypted resolvers

857
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
um and this is all about

858
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,359
these things yeah so the

859
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,040
uh home routers

860
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
in millions of homes

861
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,280
sitting there in the corner

862
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,119
people

863
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,640
generally ignore them

864
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,880
but they are hard to upgrade and if you

865
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,119
even if as an isp you send someone a

866
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,440
replacement router

867
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,520
often they just ignore it

868
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,200
so the question is how do we give these

869
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
people encrypted service

870
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,839
so

871
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,960
this ben presented this the previous one

872
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,800
in in vienna

873
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
and uh subsequently in april there was

874
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,079
an adoption call and

875
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,160
in that call there were some indications

876
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,320
of support but there were also

877
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,079
some valid points made that we agree

878
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,000
needed thinking about so

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,160
um the structure and flow quite

880
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,680
confusing it needs a normal introduction

881
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,880
um

882
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
it defines what was called a relaxed

883
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,400
validation policy

884
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
which was seen as problematic because it

885
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,839
didn't really go into

886
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
what the client should do

887
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,079
it was there was a lot of discussion

888
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
about the problems that could arise but

889
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,439
they're in later sections

890
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
another comment was using the network's

891
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
resolvable without encryption would be

892
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,599
better than an unverifiable

893
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,200
upgrade alternative

894
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
and

895
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
asking to see more revision and clarity

896
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,560
and

897
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,960
having trusted resolvers

898
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,520
would be far stronger than checking

899
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,359
again every five minutes which is one of

900
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,520
the mitigations that we had on in the

901
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,040
previous draft

902
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,359
so if you go to the next slide please so

903
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,880
the

904
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,160
uh the zero two draft is significantly

905
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
changed it's it's no longer

906
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
informational which is what the previous

907
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,040
one was

908
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,839
um this draft now proposes what client

909
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,280
should do

910
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,079
um and what it does it requires the use

911
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,880
of a reputation system to give an

912
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,920
opinion

913
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
on the discovered encrypted upstream

914
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
resolver

915
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,280
it leaves the choice of the reputation

916
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
system to the client

917
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
so

918
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,520
to be defined well not to be defined

919
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,680
here anyway

920
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
upgrades only occur if the reputation

921
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
system gives a green light and

922
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
hence it has a new name for this draft

923
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
which is reputation verified selection

924
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,760
of other stream encrypted resolvers

925
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,920
so the way it works is

926
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,520
the client does a normal ddr discovery

927
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,599
the legacy dns forwarder which was the

928
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,200
one in the picture since it doesn't

929
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,839
understand ddr it just forwards that

930
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,599
query upstream

931
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,880
the upstream

932
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,560
recursive resolver

933
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,640
has been upgraded to support an

934
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
encrypted service and so it replies with

935
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,680
its details of how to access

936
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,440
those services

937
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
the client ultimately receives that

938
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
response and then executes this

939
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
procedure which is

940
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,599
rvs

941
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,240
and that procedure verifies the identity

942
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,400
of the offered encrypted service

943
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,760
and it checks then checks the reputation

944
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,800
of those confirmed identities

945
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
if there are more than one

946
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
so

947
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,359
for example that could be checking the

948
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000
identities against an embedded list of

949
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,119
known trusted resolvers

950
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,280
if the determined reputation meets the

951
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,359
client's criteria

952
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,520
it can commence using encrypted dns

953
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,400
towards

954
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
the upstream resolver

955
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
so this is known as cross forwarder

956
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
upgrade

957
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,920
next slide please

958
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,119
so we did

959
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,240
note some

960
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,359
two issues with this so one is if the

961
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,599
local forwarder is providing an

962
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,440
essential blocking function

963
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,079
like for malware um

964
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,640
it should be told to block this cross

965
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,079
forward upgrade

966
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,319
um so we're assuming here that any

967
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,640
resolver that is doing blocking has some

968
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,040
means of which you can update what

969
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,520
exactly it's blocking um so you can add

970
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,000
resolver.arpa to that and by that means

971
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
you're blocking the cross forward

972
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,359
upgrade

973
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,400
the other one

974
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,119
is clients should be capable of

975
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,119
detecting which names

976
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,359
are part of a split horizon

977
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,319
so they can exempt those queries from a

978
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,319
cross-folder upgrade

979
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,720
so for example example.local.home.arpa

980
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,079
and the names that are learned by our

981
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,040
local mechanisms are validated as we've

982
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,560
just discussed

983
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,720
and if none of that is possible on the

984
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,599
client then an x domain fallback is

985
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,280
something that can also be used

986
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,240
next slide please

987
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,200
so

988
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,680
this is all about the reputation system

989
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,480
so

990
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
embedding a list of known trusted

991
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,079
resolvers in the client is only one

992
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,599
possible model for

993
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,400
assessing that reputation um so in

994
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,960
future a range of online reputation

995
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
systems

996
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,280
might be available to queried and they

997
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,359
they would could each return an answer

998
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,000
according to their own specific criteria

999
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
so you might have a wrong

1000
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,480
property such as the jurisdiction of the

1001
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,960
resolver or its certification by a

1002
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,520
particular body

1003
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
it's out of scope for the draft to

1004
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
define the query methods um just it just

1005
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,160
notes that

1006
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,359
designers should be aware of

1007
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,000
bootstrapping problems in um looking

1008
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,920
that up

1009
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
it's the client's decision of course as

1010
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,839
to how to combine those answers

1011
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,079
possibly using other metadata but

1012
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,160
ultimately it makes a determination of

1013
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,879
reputation

1014
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,040
so if you are a

1015
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,400
developer of

1016
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,359
client software um why should you care

1017
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,560
about this

1018
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,000
so

1019
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,599
as we kind of mentioned at the beginning

1020
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,640
so there's

1021
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,599
um

1022
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,000
a larger fraction of residential

1023
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,640
internet users

1024
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
rely on local dns forwarders that are

1025
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,079
not compatible with ddr because they are

1026
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,560
on a private ip address

1027
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,599
and they are

1028
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,920
difficult to upgrade

1029
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,079
so if we do nothing it's likely that um

1030
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:32,960
that

1031
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,599
half of those users will continue to

1032
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,800
be relying on doe 53

1033
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,720
and of course that means that they are

1034
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,400
subject to

1035
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,720
passive monitoring either on the local

1036
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,200
network or between that network

1037
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,119
and the upstream

1038
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,200
so it's considerably

1039
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
quicker to enable encrypted dns

1040
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
for a handful of isp core network sites

1041
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,119
than to enable it for those millions of

1042
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,800
forwarders

1043
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
rvs enables the use of encrypted

1044
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,040
transport in those configurations

1045
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,480
next slide please

1046
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,800
um so in the draft

1047
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,319
um

1048
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,760
it does define

1049
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,040
a particular way of

1050
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,240
confirming

1051
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,200
the identity of the upstream

1052
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
uh resolver that we've been pointed

1053
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,839
towards and in fact the method is is the

1054
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,560
one that um ben ben mentioned earlier

1055
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,440
about

1056
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,480
uh

1057
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,319
getting the certificate and iterating

1058
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,200
through

1059
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,160
um

1060
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,800
doing the dance as it was put

1061
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,680
um another an alternative to that is we

1062
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,280
could just look at the service binding

1063
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,599
target name and use that as the resolver

1064
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,400
identity but that would um

1065
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
require the use of s i

1066
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,000
and it would not be compatible with all

1067
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
upstream resolvers

1068
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
um

1069
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,319
the other open question is we could

1070
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,400
simplify the resolver identity so

1071
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,000
currently for do

1072
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
the resolver identity is the uri

1073
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,280
template um

1074
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,040
we could shrink that down to just the

1075
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,319
domain name

1076
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
that makes the reputation systems easier

1077
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,160
because you just have to define a

1078
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,599
reputation

1079
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,839
for whatever the domain name

1080
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,520
is but the problem with n is you don't

1081
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,920
you can't differentiate between

1082
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,359
different

1083
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,680
uri paths on the same domain name

1084
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
so

1085
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,839
that's that's the draft 0-2 in a

1086
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,440
nutshell

1087
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,119
question for the working group is do you

1088
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,520
think that's better

1089
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,760
would it be beneficial to users

1090
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,640
and

1091
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,920
can the design be improved

1092
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,280
ready for questions

1093
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
yep

1094
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,760
have you seen that view is open and eric

1095
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,079
please

1096
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,800
eric google um mostly just a general

1097
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
vote of confidence i liked the last

1098
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,560
version of this and thought it was the

1099
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,400
best plan to solve the problem of

1100
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,760
upgrading

1101
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
when the home routers are in play and

1102
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,520
this new version

1103
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,960
it does a lot of clarifications it

1104
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
mostly mandates the part of the original

1105
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,240
strategies i wanted and allows other

1106
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,400
parts i wanted and so for all i'm

1107
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,680
still happy with this and still want to

1108
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,040
do it so i'm still enthusiastic and i

1109
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,960
still want this to be adopted

1110
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,240
thank you great thanks all right

1111
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,880
andrew kempling

1112
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,119
hi i just wanted to say on i suppose on

1113
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
the second question that uh

1114
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,960
chris asks uh given i think we had stats

1115
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,920
possibly from google that 85 percent

1116
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,800
of traffic comes from private ip

1117
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
addresses that this is

1118
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,880
extremely beneficial to users

1119
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,400
um so

1120
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,760
we've got to have a solution to the

1121
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,200
problem of how to support consumers in

1122
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,319
probably most markets geographically

1123
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,560
around the world this does it so unless

1124
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,079
we've got a better idea

1125
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,920
we need to move forward with this

1126
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,720
as soon as we can

1127
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,960
thank you andrew tommy jensen

1128
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,480
tommy jensen microsoft

1129
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,720
i find a new direction quite interesting

1130
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
if i'm understanding the presentation

1131
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
correctly uh admitting that i haven't

1132
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,000
read the full text yet that instead of

1133
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
trying to address the problem of if the

1134
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,920
upgrade was secure it's more about

1135
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,119
somehow i got to a new resolver and i

1136
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,720
would like to know if this resolver

1137
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,160
independent of how i found it is

1138
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,359
trustworthy

1139
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,800
um

1140
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
generally speaking i think that's a

1141
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,560
better security approach so

1142
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,720
uh thanks for addressing that feedback i

1143
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,319
will say in terms of interest and

1144
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,760
adoption that

1145
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
i'm

1146
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,520
it's hard for me to imagine a way in

1147
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,599
which our ecosystem would benefit from

1148
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,000
having such a system uh

1149
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,760
i say that because we've

1150
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,720
desperately avoided having a trust list

1151
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
note that the list of resolvers that

1152
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,839
currently ships in windows is a

1153
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,480
bootstrapping uh

1154
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,839
convenience

1155
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,599
we don't trust those resolvers any more

1156
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,359
than we trust any other resolvers we

1157
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,760
fully rely on the user to to select a

1158
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,119
resolver and so the question i would

1159
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,800
pose in terms of

1160
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,559
interest in adoption from the client

1161
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,599
side is if as a client i am having some

1162
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,680
custom solution to evaluate the

1163
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,839
trustworthiness of resolver that means i

1164
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,800
have some idea of who i trust why not

1165
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,599
have some similarly out of band specific

1166
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,599
to me mechanism to simply

1167
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,319
provide the resolvers to the client

1168
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,640
thank you

1169
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,280
thank you tommy

1170
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,200
and the queue is closed thank you chris

1171
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,439
and ben

1172
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,760
uh next on the agenda is a time for open

1173
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,040
discussion

1174
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,480
um and aob's if anybody had either

1175
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,000
something they want to revisit some

1176
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,839
general comments to offer

1177
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,200
glenn and i actually do have an

1178
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,240
aob but we have decided to put it off

1179
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,800
till ietf115 when we both can be fully

1180
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,440
engaged in it

1181
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,599
so we leave it and now you in the room

1182
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,160
if you have anything that you would like

1183
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,960
to bring up

1184
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,160
tim's making motions like he did but

1185
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,400
uh i think in that case i want to invite

1186
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,400
glenn to the microphone because

1187
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,240
he claims he has a working microphone

1188
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,479
now

1189

planning a wrap-up uh thank you for uh

1199
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,119
being patient with us as we got the

1200
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,960
kinks worked out of the system here i

1201
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,040
think uh tail and myself work best when

1202
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,040
we're a team and when one of the team is

1203
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
actually working his job properly and

1204
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,440
and not just dumping on the other guy so

1205
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,839
my apologies from from not holding up my

1206
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,400
side of the uh the production

1207
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,599
quality here

1208
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
um other than that i think we were in

1209
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,200
really good shape you know i'm glad that

1210
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,720
we've got the three drafts that are now

1211
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,040
going um you know through through the

1212
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,720
final parts of the process that's really

1213
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,760
wonderful

1214
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,599
you know i i want to point out this is

1215
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,839
the first time addd has met in person

1216
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,720
actually

1217
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,160
um you know

1218
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,280
at least the first time you've had one

1219
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,040
of the chairs in the room uh so you know

1220
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,559
pat yourselves on the back we've done

1221
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,520
this

1222
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,680
in the last two years all virtually and

1223
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
the fact we've actually got three drafts

1224
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,160
now um on their way off and we've got a

1225
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,920
couple more good ones in the pipeline is

1226
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,599
quite the a testament to how well this

1227
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,839
group has come together and worked very

1228
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,240
hard over the last uh two years so

1229
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,000
my thanks to you for being a really good

1230
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,599
group to manage

1231
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,200
that's all i've got to say over to

1232
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
youtail

1233
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,800
yeah uh

1234
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,720
along those lines perhaps the pandemic

1235
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,640
actually worked in our favor

1236
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,720
the word um ever since the beginning of

1237
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,000
dough there's always been this

1238
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,200
expectation that there were going to be

1239
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,800
a lot of fisticuffs around this whole

1240
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
topic area and so the group has been

1241
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
remarkably civil has done very well and

1242
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,520
we're all very thankful for that

1243
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
but that really would be the end of the

1244
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,480
add a session unless um eric wants to

1245
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,920
comment on anything he's shaking his

1246
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,400
head no so i would just again like to

1247
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,880

said so

1268
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,599
any aging is because he's been working

1269

as an area director way too long so and

1270
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,839

1271
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,839

1275
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,760
believe brian's here someplace so

1276
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,440
dude next yep

1277
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,160
so it's not yeah so he came up with a

1278
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,760
very last minute week excuse for not

1279
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
showing up

1280
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,520
so

1281
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,680
so he may be online to sort of say stuff

1282
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,960
but we'll see

1283
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,359
looks like barry has something to say

1284
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
so please let me know this is barry i'm

1285
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,839
asking about logistics for dealing with

1286
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:52,880
this

1287
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,240
um

1288
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,280
i presume that we all stay in the add

1289
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,440
session yes we all stay inside the 80d

1290
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,079
actually what about the um the chat the

1291
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,480
zulip chat it should be the same and

1292
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,920
then what we'll do it they'll be

1293
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,359
combined into the minutes and we'll

1294
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,880
probably break them out into minutes for

1295
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,000
both of us

1296
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,920
as well that's what we did last time and

1297
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,760
it seemed to seem to work very well

1298
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,119
thank you so

1299
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,200
we like i like to copy the minutes copy

1300
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,200
the chat into the minutes at the end is

1301
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,800
sort of like it's because it's a great

1302
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,760
way to sort of track all the

1303
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,440
conversations sort of thing

1304
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,319
so

1305
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,240
you've seen the code of conduct you know

1306
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,160
about the masking policy

1307
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,280
um

1308
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,319
let's pop off our agenda's pretty short

1309
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
um

1310
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,160
we we've got some working group status

1311
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
where we stand things of that nature and

1312
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,599
we're going to discuss unilateral

1313
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,079
probing daniel he submitted some slides

1314
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,760
an hour ahead of time which is plenty of

1315
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,160
time i'm not sure why he was worried so

1316
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
um we're ready for those

1317
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,760
so basically

1318
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,280
sort of where we stand

1319
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,800
and brian will kind of speak to this as

1320
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,240
well if he actually actually showed up

1321
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,359
for the meeting

1322
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,800
um

1323
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,839
is

1324
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,119
things are moving along but they're kind

1325
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,520
of slow we understand that we're

1326
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,440
considering kind of maybe going dark for

1327
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,839
a little bit while implementations go on

1328
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,680
it's like we're not sort of chasing

1329
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,119
people away but we want to see some

1330
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,119
stuff get built and some flight with we

1331
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,800
like the work going on in unilateral

1332
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,359
probing and we just want to see

1333
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,960
where things are going and we're hoping

1334
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,640
there's some you know folks some

1335
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,160
implanters sort of show up and say hell

1336
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,480
yeah we've got something this that etc

1337
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,520
etc so we're open to suggestions on that

1338
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,040
we'd like to hear ideas from the work

1339
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,520
group or what else they think we could

1340
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,400
be doing on that stage as well

1341
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,440
so

1342
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,480
so next

1343
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,079
i believe that's it from the slides and

1344
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,760
i think then we've got mr mr gilmore

1345
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
so

1346
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,359
we'll let him take it away

1347
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,359
i think i have to reload my meet echo

1348
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,200
session to actually get your slide since

1349
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,480
they approved do what you need to do

1350
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,480
technology

1351
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,400
this is the part where i get to sing

1352
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,480
right yeah yeah

1353
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,800
because

1354
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,599
yeah it's not in

1355
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,720
but it's definitely in the approach

1356
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,640
look at all that unilateral pro here we

1357
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,520
go all right okay but now let's get it

1358
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,119
it still doesn't show up in the

1359
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,880
presenting list though

1360
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,839
oh wait a new slide deck has been shared

1361
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,520
it's like magic you know sorry

1362
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,400
indistinguishable from broken technology

1363
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,359
i blame me

1364
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,000
so

1365
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,319
i'm going to talk to you all about the

1366
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,559
unilateral probing document

1367
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,839
um which basically is about uh

1368
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:24,960
probing

1369
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,359
for encrypted transport between the

1370
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,280
recursive resolver and the authoritative

1371
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,960
dns server

1372
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,319
um the basic idea behind it while this

1373
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,960
draft well this slides come up just as a

1374
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,119
recap to remind you

1375
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,079
is that uh the idea here is people have

1376
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,559
some concerns about how how well

1377
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,240
recursive resolvers are going to be able

1378
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,000
to make encrypted connections to

1379
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,480
authoritative servers

1380
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,839
and we wanted to just get more

1381
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,359
experience without having to answer the

1382
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,280
hard questions of like

1383
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,680
how do we authenticate the server

1384
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,880
or

1385
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,960
when should we hard fail or what do we

1386
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,119
do if there are problems we just wanted

1387
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,839
to try doing it and so the unilateral

1388
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,280
probing document

1389
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,040
uh is relatively straightforward and

1390
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,040
that it basically says the recursive

1391
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,359
resolver should just try

1392
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,720
um

1393
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,319
and the authoritative server should

1394
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,079
offer encrypted transport and the

1395
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,480
recursive resolver should try uh

1396
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,000
encrypted transport

1397
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,440
and it gives some guidance about how to

1398
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,680
do that in a way that minimizes

1399
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,520
uh excess uh resource consumption that

1400
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,200
reduces the amount of clear text but

1401
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,440
makes no real guarantees certainly no

1402
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,280
guarantees against an active attacker on

1403
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,760
the network

1404
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,119
so

1405
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,520
the document has been through a couple

1406
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,839
of drafts paul hoffman just came on as

1407
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,680
an additional author which is much

1408
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,040
appreciated

1409
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,359
um

1410
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,599
i don't want to interrupt this

1411
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,799
the slides

1412
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,400
issue here

1413
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,440
but the

1414
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,839
uh the baseline for this is is really

1415
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,440
not it's really not that hard it's very

1416
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,760
similar in some sense to happy eyeballs

1417
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,599
which we use to try to get ipv4 and ipv6

1418
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,359
when you weren't sure what you could do

1419
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,280
it's basically saying do a similar kind

1420
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,599
of thing between clear text dns traffic

1421
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,960
between the recurser and the

1422
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,119
authoritative but do it with encrypted

1423
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,119
transport and there's a few parameters

1424
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,960
that it recommends setting about if you

1425
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,559
learn that you have a successful

1426
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,880
encrypted transport to an authoritative

1427
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,280
server

1428
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,200
you can remember that for a short period

1429
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,280
of time and then use that to avoid

1430
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
sending clear text as long as you know

1431
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,599
that you are likely to have a successful

1432
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,680
encrypted connection and it does all of

1433
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,160
that without any uh authentication

1434
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,440
requirements

1435
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,680
so the idea is this is a baseline

1436
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,920
um that hopefully can be then merged

1437
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,799
with

1438
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,640
some ability to do authenticated and

1439
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,960
potentially uh strict

1440
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,760
uh encrypted transport between on that

1441
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,680
leg um

1442
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,040
uh when that becomes available

1443
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,200
um

1444
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,280
so you've got slides there

1445
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,400
it's coming all right

1446
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,680
i mean i feel like the slides are going

1447
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,079
to be a real letdown uh after all of

1448
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,240
this

1449
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,720
oh yeah look at that it never showed up

1450
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,000
in the regular presenting queue all

1451
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,440
right you hacked around it i appreciate

1452
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,000
that i did the recap there um

1453
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,559
yep so um

1454
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,559
uh yeah so the primary goal of this

1455
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,640
draft though is that there should be no

1456
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,960
need for explicit coordination between

1457
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,400
the authoritative resolver and the

1458
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,079
recurser

1459
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,440
that basically

1460
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,040
this is really just about how do you

1461
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,200
just try in a way that doesn't make

1462
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,359
everybody on the network sad

1463
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,880
how do we do it so that it doesn't scare

1464
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,079
people off

1465
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,640
next slide

1466
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,200
the main changes in the latest version

1467
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,280
aside from adding uh

1468
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,160
paul to the uh authors list

1469
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,559
uh as we took some discussion about

1470
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,240
maybe what the future steps might be and

1471
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,319
move that to an appendix to not distract

1472
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,160
from the main point did some

1473
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,240
clarification about state transitions

1474
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,000
when sending over encrypted transport

1475
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,079
the definition of the state transitions

1476
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,720
was slightly wrong it was uh actually a

1477
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,119
little more strict than it needed to be

1478
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,240
um

1479
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,839
with this kind of happy eyeballs

1480
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,440
approach we actually want you to even if

1481
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,280
you got an answer back

1482
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,839
uh from cleartext we'd like you to keep

1483
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,359
trying with your encrypted connection

1484
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,359
because maybe you'll learn something on

1485
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,720
that try for the next time you have to

1486
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,880
talk to that resolver

1487
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,359
and uh somebody i think sarah dickinson

1488
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,799
i think noticed

1489
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,070
that the um

1490
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,359
[Music]

1491
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,680
the way we were looking at how long we

1492
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,280
should persist was measuring from the

1493
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,960
first connection

1494
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,000
uh to the server as opposed to the last

1495
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,599
connection the most recent connection to

1496
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,680
the server so we were maybe timing out a

1497
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,799
little bit sooner than we should have

1498
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,280
been in the in the algorithm described

1499
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,680
there so review of that nature if

1500
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,280
anybody else wants to take a stab at it

1501
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,040
was always welcome it's easy to get

1502
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,960
these things subtly wrong and people who

1503
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,280
have experience implementing uh can

1504
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,520
probably identify places where where we

1505
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,799
got it wrong better than somebody who's

1506
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,960
just skimming the draft so we definitely

1507
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,640
hope to see more implementers on that

1508
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,839
note next slide

1509
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,359
please um

1510
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,839
powerdns recurser has announced that

1511
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,240
they are basically implementing uh this

1512
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,760
approach for

1513
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,760
adot that is authoritative dns over tls

1514
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,440
i don't know that it exactly meets the

1515
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,440
draft but their approach is what they

1516
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,680
all quote just try it which sounds a lot

1517
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,920
like this

1518
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,160
i'll also note that the the

1519
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,720
authoritative server for the

1520
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,119
powerdns.com zone is also offering

1521
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,720
dot

1522
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,359
the draft itself is agnostic about a dot

1523
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,680
versus adoq that is authoritative dns

1524
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,760
over quick so some folks might be

1525
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,599
interested in trying to do adoq as well

1526
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,920
we encourage implementers to try that i

1527
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,760
will note that after i wrote these

1528
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,280
slides but before i stepped up here i

1529
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,000
noticed that a.n.s.facebook.com

1530
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,520
is answering on tls on port 853

1531
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,359
it may or may not be

1532
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,280
authenticatable

1533
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,119
if you're using a standard tls stack but

1534
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,720
again that's fine for the purposes of

1535
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,160
this draft so

1536
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,760
if you're running an authoritative a

1537
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,880
recurser

1538
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,720
and you enable this you might be able to

1539
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,079
encrypt all the connections that go to

1540
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,359
facebook

1541
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,200
so that might be something interesting

1542
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,720
to be able to note

1543
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,440
um we're looking for other implementers

1544
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,359
to stick their head up and say hey i

1545
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,960
tried to do this it worked for me it

1546
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,079
didn't work for me this is what we ran

1547
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:32,960
into

1548
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,799
we want to ensure that it doesn't

1549
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,880
overwhelm authoritatives so if you're an

1550
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,000
authoritative and you're seeing these

1551
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,200
queries

1552
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,559
you want to report back we'd love to

1553
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,839
hear from from you as well

1554
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,280
i i just want to ask if there's any

1555
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,799
implementers in the room

1556
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,119
who maybe want to start working on this

1557
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,440
please step up and let us know

1558
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,799
because we'd like to see more than just

1559
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,319
peter out there

1560
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,920
working away in the corner sort of

1561
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,960
quietly

1562
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,280
sort of sort of think

1563
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,680
thank you sir thank you tim okay

1564
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,440
oh so are you speaking up here been

1565
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,839
offended at nilmar

1566
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
labs dkg we will talk with each other

1567
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,760
about our plans and how we can

1568
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,920
collaborate and help you yeah great

1569
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,530
thank you

1570
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,559
[Music]

1571
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,319
punitsu the google public dns so i

1572
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,559
haven't really read the whole draft i'm

1573
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,000
just reading it

1574
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,520
while in the add session we do implement

1575
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,960
some version

1576
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,599
of unilateral probing we have to see how

1577
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,319
much our implementation is different

1578
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,400
from what's specified in this traffic

1579
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,240
great uh i'd love to hear feedback from

1580
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,400
that and again the strap is not claiming

1581
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,559
to be perfect and uh

1582
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,160
feedback from the implementers who have

1583
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,039
experience are welcome obviously uh

1584
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,559
coming from google public dns you have a

1585
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,640
different scale of uh

1586
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,240
implementation

1587
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,680
than than somebody who might be

1588
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,520
implementing it on a you know an office

1589
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
network or something victor

1590
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,799
uh victor de carnegie google public dns

1591
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,599
i'm looking for

1592
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,400
operators of authoritative servers

1593
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,240
who will share

1594
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,200
preferences particularly around their

1595
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,760
tls tuning are they looking to do tls

1596
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,880
resumption do they strongly want it

1597
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,039
do they support it

1598
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,000
any feedback on you know the experience

1599
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,799
with timers idle and the like i want to

1600
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,319
hear about tuning

1601
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,599
please get in touch uh especially if you

1602
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,240
have uh dns servers behind load

1603
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,160
balancers i want to hear how that works

1604
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,160
with a dot all that sort of stuff thank

1605
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,319
you yep and all those details are

1606
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,839
details that i would be happy to include

1607
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,119
in the draft if you're comfortable with

1608
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,640
them being public but obviously also if

1609
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,920
you want to talk to people privately

1610
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,520
that's that's that's good too right no

1611
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,880
i'm not operating an authority of

1612
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,400
servers i don't have anything to share

1613
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,319
no i'm not asking you i'm not asking you

1614
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,079
victor to share it i'm actually i'm i'm

1615
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,400
i'm trying to amplify your your requests

1616
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,680
because i think that information would

1617
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,640
be very useful to have

1618
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,119
paul hoffman

1619
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,520
paul hoffman co-author

1620
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,440
for the people in the room who haven't

1621
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,799
read it or haven't been reading it

1622
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,880
carefully the last discussion we just

1623
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,079
had is actually not that relevant

1624
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,720
that is the draft says if you're a

1625
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,240
client

1626
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,039
go ahead and try and do these things we

1627
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,280
believe and if we're wrong we certainly

1628
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,480
want to hear

1629
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,599
if you misimplement the client side of

1630
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,599
the draft you're not going to hurt

1631
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,559
anything you may have some extra delays

1632
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,319
and such but you're not going to be

1633
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,880
hurting any authoritative servers if

1634
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,599
we're wrong let us know but so the whole

1635
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,640
thing of

1636
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,520
you know the the the whole part of this

1637
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,880
is that

1638
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,599
there doesn't have to be coordination

1639
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,440
if you're going to do authoritative

1640
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,200
authenticated later there of course has

1641
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,319
to be coordination but for now what we

1642
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,039
want is a document that says

1643
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,200
even if you've gotten

1644
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,440
you know this wrong about remembering

1645
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,599
and stuff you're probably going to have

1646
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,079
negligible or literally no effect on the

1647
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,400
authoritative servers

1648
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,799
so if if you're an authoritative server

1649
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,280
operator reading the document and we've

1650
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,640
done anything

1651
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,720
that you think

1652
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,359
could affect you negatively by all means

1653
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,960
let us know because we would like to

1654
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,039
pull that out this is supposed to be

1655
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,640
harmless yep

1656
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,880
and as a reminder the document also

1657
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,200
offers guidance to authoritative server

1658
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,520
operators as well in terms of how you

1659
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,720
probably want to configure your systems

1660
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,480
and so if you're implementing this on

1661
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,920
the authoritative side

1662
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,520
and you think that that guidance is

1663
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,400
lacking or insufficient or wrong or you

1664
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,079
think it's good we'd love to hear from

1665
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,079
you

1666
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,640
so yeah next slide thanks uh outstanding

1667
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,319
questions in the draft there's a handful

1668
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,000
of fix me's that are related to error

1669
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,119
handling

1670
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,160
uh mostly on the uh guidance for the

1671
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,039
recursive resolver side um again i don't

1672
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,280
think that these need to be uh perfect

1673
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,960
uh but it would be good to give to some

1674
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,319
general results about the different

1675
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,400
kinds of errors you might be able to see

1676
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,319
um if you've got some strong opinions

1677
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,480
about how you want that to see want that

1678
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,799
to happen on a

1679
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:17,760
um

1680
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,160
on this opportunistic uh unilateral

1681
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,880
approach uh be good to receive some text

1682
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,480
on that there is a question about

1683
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
whether the document should be standards

1684
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,079
track

1685
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,520
as opposed to

1686
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,200
experimental or informational or

1687
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,079
something like that i think we are

1688
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,920
leaning towards standards track but we

1689
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,200
good to hear from the working group on

1690
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,240
that

1691
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,760
uh and there's some open questions about

1692
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,920
whether we want more explicit like

1693
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,839
visualization of the types of steps that

1694
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,000
we're expecting the resolver uh the

1695
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,960
recursive resolver to take in terms of

1696
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,960
how it keeps track of

1697
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,319
whether it thinks it's got a good

1698
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,079
connection or a history of good

1699
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,039
connections to a given authoritative

1700
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,920
so if folks are good at doing

1701
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,839
you know flow control diagrams or things

1702
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,359
and think they can do it draw draw some

1703
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,359
nice pictures that's always a welcome

1704
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,599
thing uh for implementers who to look at

1705
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,599
so come talk to me i've got some ideas

1706
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,880
about how we could draw those pictures

1707
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,599
but

1708
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,520
you might have better ones um so anybody

1709
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,559
who's interested in doing that kind of

1710
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,240
stuff too happy to have

1711
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,599
contributors

1712
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,920
next

1713
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,680
yeah so

1714
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,520
this is basically what i just told you

1715
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,920
there is a get lab

1716
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
repo that has

1717
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,839
some open issues on it a

1718
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,839
fairly short list of open issues at the

1719
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,960
moment

1720
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,319
if you want to take a look at those

1721
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,680
issues

1722
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,920
or you want to grab the doc and flesh

1723
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,760
out a fix me

1724
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,200
we'd be happy to take merge requests um

1725
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,720
you can also just of course send

1726
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,240
messages to the mailing list for

1727
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,599
anything substantive because it would be

1728
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,760
good to see the discussion there too

1729
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,960
um

1730
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,799
you know we're hoping to have a version

1731
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,400
of this with all the fixmes cleaned up

1732
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,720
before the next ietf

1733
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,280
and maybe we will get

1734
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,720
maybe we'll get an opportunity to ask

1735
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,280
for a working group last call then but

1736
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,640
getting more feedback from implementers

1737
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,920
in the meantime would definitely be

1738
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,920
preferable

1739
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,559
i think that's what i've got um if folks

1740
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,039
have questions about the draft or or or

1741
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,280
complaints or gripes or whatever

1742
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,238
i think

1743
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,519
please come up to the mic line

1744
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,439
queue looks empty um

1745
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,880
