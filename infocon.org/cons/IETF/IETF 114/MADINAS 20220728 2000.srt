99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
well i we already sent an email about

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
this we are starting to use github so we

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
have the github organization created

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,440
according to the rfsc so we have one now

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
for the madinas you can get to that into

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
the madina's data tracker information

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
page there is there a link

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
for the additional resources and there

107
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,440
is the the

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
github organization there

109
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
and if you go there you'll see that

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
there are a couple of repositories one

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
per working group document

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
that uh we will be using as

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
nfc 88 74

114
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,600
recommends so basically we'll use that

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
to keep the documents and manage the the

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
issues and editorial recommendations

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
from the working group

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
this is a learning process i mean i i

119
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
have been using github but i'm not an

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
expert i i not expect all the people in

121
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
the working hood to be experts on how to

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
use github

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
but i think it's a good tool to keep

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
track of the

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
the text suggestions and recommendations

126
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,759
but it's also important that we will be

127
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
using or keep using the mailing list for

128
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,600
the actual discussion so we are not

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
moving the discussion to the github it's

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
not the purpose

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
the github is an additional tool to

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
facilitate keeping track of some

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
editorial issues and and providing text

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
in a way that is easier for the editors

135
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
to to manage

136
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
but it should be a tool to facilitate

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
things not too complicated of course and

138
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
the discussion should be

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
keep kept on the on the mainly list

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,318
any comments any

141
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,520
if not we can switch to the

142
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
next point in the agenda which is the

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
updates from 90 believe from juan carlos

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
so let me

145
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,759
share

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
and let me give you

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,880
the control

148
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
thanks carlos can you hear me

149
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
yes

150
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
great hi everyone hope you're having a

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
good time in philadelphia

152
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,400
eating a lot of cheese steak sandwiches

153
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
so

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,199
uh this is an update from the ie80211

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,560
meeting that i was

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,639
able to attend a couple of weeks ago in

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,759
montreal

158
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,800
um

159
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,360
and i think it was important to

160
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
to remind people and give an update

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
about the the work in w

162
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
and 11 bh and bi especially bh

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
so uh 11bh has

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,199
is discussing

165
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
some use cases where they may need some

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
identifiers some new identifiers now

167
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
that they cannot rely on

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
on random mac addresses any longer

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
and

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
they are mainly going around i t support

171
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,440
and captive portal type of use cases

172
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,240
so

173
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,039
uh

174
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,000
as you remember remind me uh sorry as

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
you remember from the last discussion

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
the the group's still discussing the

177
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
three general directions

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
uh the first one is when an sta or a

179
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
station

180
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
a mobile in this case generates a layer

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
2 id

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
and passes it on to the ap after

183
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
association through

184
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
secure tunnel and then for tell the for

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,599
tells ap if

186
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
if the id is changing in the future

187
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
the second approach is for the ap to

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,599
generate this id or the network to

189
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,879
generate the id

190
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,080
and pass it

191
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
to the

192
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
to the station after association

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
and then the sda will signal whenever

194
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
there's a new association so that the ap

195
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,759
can generate a new one

196
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
and the third approach is

197
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
uh to exchange

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
keys allowing common computation of this

199
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
id

200
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,599
so that both

201
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,319
know

202
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
who they are talking to

203
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
and the group still uh

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
discussing these three approaches there

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
is of course pros and cons and different

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,919
points of view

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
uh regarding these three approaches but

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,919
but anyway i think this is something

209
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,840
that we need to keep in mind

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
uh in our future discussions uh when we

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
look at the use cases more in detail

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,479
as we

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,279
want to coordinate uh with ieee we don't

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,320
want to

215
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
uh reinvent or or do the work twice

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,640
and uh and we also have to we want to

217
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
complement each other as much as

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
possible

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,120
so

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
the other group that is of relevance is

221
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
11bi

222
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,320
um this group is not looking at new

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
identifiers but rather examining what uh

224
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
elements may have an impact on privacy

225
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
and how can

226
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
they be uh better protected

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
in in this case they are talking about

228
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
uh obsoleting uh key identifiers in

229
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
resolutions

230
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
uh

231
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
reducing the fingerprint exposure

232
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
because of uh

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
multiple options in pro messages and ies

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,519
etc

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,560
so

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
it's it's interesting but not i think as

237
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,839
impactful as

238
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,560
11bh

239
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
something that we may want to keep in

240
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
mind is to to continue this discussion

241
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
so far we've been having these updates

242
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,600
here about what's going on in 11 but

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
they are less aware of what we plan to

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
do in madinas or what we are looking at

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
in martinez and the relationships that

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
we are

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
establishing and having with

248
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,519
wba etc wfa

249
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,320
so

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
it will probably be good to to keep

251
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,480
this conversation more open in the

252
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,880
future

253
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
are there any questions

254
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
eric

255
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
looks like michael beat me to the queue

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,920
ah why don't you go ahead

257
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
um my question was i think if you go

258
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
back one slide

259
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
it said after association

260
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
uh was uh was there any

261
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
have people given up on um what you do

262
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
about mac addresses randomization during

263
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
scanning maybe just accepting that it's

264
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
uh

265
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
going to be random when they scan or uh

266
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,040
uh

267
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
is is eight or two eleven

268
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
worried about uh

269
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
i i'll uh i think i can well i'll take a

270
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
start and then maybe jerome i think sean

271
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
lankan can help me out here but i

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
believe yeah the group is it's mainly

273
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
concentrating on on ones you have

274
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
already associated uh and for the for

275
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
the scanning part

276
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
uh we assume that uh that it's going to

277
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
be a random address but i don't know

278
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
jerome can you give more info

279
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,079
yes um so yeah absolutely so there are

280
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,000
two two elements right there is the

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
scanning part and there is the

282
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
pre-association part

283
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,079
um and they they make the difference

284
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
during scanning you know you're just

285
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
discovering the environment so they are

286
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
not looking at trying to give an

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
identifier to somebody who's just

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,079
discovering so that is going to stay at

289
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,920
least in the intent of the group um

290
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
completely private and therefore

291
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
randomized however they are heavily

292
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
debating right now um what they call

293
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
pre-association steering where for

294
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
example you want to have an iot device

295
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,920
go to 2.4 and your your arvr stuff go to

296
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,079
6 gigahertz which means that the ap

297
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,000
needs to be somehow able to identify

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
what kind of devices discovery network

299
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
to direct this device accordingly

300
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,120
um and for now there are there are two

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
plans you know those that say it's

302
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
pre-association you don't touch it

303
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,639
and those who say you need to provide a

304
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,920
better experience therefore you need to

305
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
direct correctly there's you need to

306
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,399
know something um they are in the middle

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
of that conversation it's been going on

308
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
for about two and a half months now i

309
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
expect a few more months of a heavy

310
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
battle

311
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
uh that makes sense thank you very much

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
sure

313
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
michael richardson um on the same slide

314
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,839
this just sounds an absolutely terrible

315
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,279
idea um

316
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
i guess someone at the ieee thinks that

317
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
access points run captive portals

318
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
because that's usually not the case

319
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,000
they're usually the captive portal

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
in the layer two architecture behind a

321
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
whole bunch of access points

322
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
so

323
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
mostly the ieee doesn't own the protocol

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
behind that

325
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,040
it's mostly proprietary

326
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,200
and the ietf owns the captive portal api

327
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,399
so

328
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,360
um

329
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
i don't think this is a good place or

330
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
good group to do this kind of work at

331
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
the ieee i think that's again the ieee

332
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,399
believing that there are protocols other

333
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,040
than ip which there aren't

334
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
anymore

335
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
um if someone's running decknet over

336
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
wi-fi then maybe this applies but i mean

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
i just i just don't see them this is

338
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,800
just a whole bunch of work to me that i

339
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,240
don't i don't know why this thing i

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,839
don't know how to how to express the

341
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
fact the frustration of

342
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,279
of

343
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
this kind of direction to me

344
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,160
okay

345
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
um this is not useful as for the

346
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
question of iot devices and some other

347
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
stuff well i hope that one of the things

348
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,839
that this working group is going to do

349
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
is produce a document

350
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
which essentially says that in 94 of the

351
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
cases that home iot devices should never

352
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,519
randomize their mac address that it's

353
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
inappropriate and unsafe

354
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,639
so the only ones that should be managed

355
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,079
should be randomized to the ones that

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,560
you carry to and from the starbucks for

357
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
some reason

358
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,959
um

359
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,000
so

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,560
anyway i don't know how to get this eric

361
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
some more clear liaison going on because

362
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,279
i think this is a disaster um i think

363
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
it's undeployable it's an undeployable

364
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
disaster

365
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
um and the people that aren't going to

366
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,800
be able to deploy it

367
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,720
don't go to the iti ieee to speak up

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,600
to say that this is undeployable so

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
my my feedback here i don't know how to

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
express it to the ieee

371
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
okay um

372
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
thanks for the for the comment uh

373
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
yeah indeed i i think that uh

374
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,560
at least from my point of view uh they

375
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,839
are missing some information about

376
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,680
what's going on here and it wouldn't

377
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
hurt to to open up the channel

378
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
and um

379
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,519
again jerome i don't know if you want to

380
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
add something since you've been

381
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
uh more active in v8

382
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
yeah i mean

383
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
i i fully agree with all the comments

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,040
that were made

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
but just for clarity what what bh par

386
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
also

387
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,079
um uh

388
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,560
goal or or framework is

389
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,639
is what was working before that is

390
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
broken now that rcm is in place you know

391
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
randomizing choosing mac addresses um

392
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,320
and things they have noticed that are

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,839
broken is you go back to your room in

394
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,040
the hotel and you have to be

395
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
authenticated all the time um so that's

396
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
because of that this on their charter it

397
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,839
does not necessarily mean that they are

398
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,480
going to produce a solution clear too

399
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,920
and you know the more liaison we can

400
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,839
send to them say well there is a hope

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
that itf can fix that because in keport

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,399
for example um it's not necessarily the

403
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,839
mac address but the mac address is one

404
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,120
of the items that can be used to

405
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,279
identify a station so the more reason we

406
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
can bring to them to tell them the

407
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,720
solution will be will be brought you

408
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
know by the industry outside of there

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,279
too

410
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
the better they will be armed to to you

411
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,959
know conclude that there is no need for

412
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,000
them to do any work there

413
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
eric lanigan i i just wanted to sort of

414
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
respond to michael i did not take from

415
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,079
this slide that they were assuming a

416
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
capture portal was going to be inside of

417
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
an ap

418
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,920
but simply that the the uh uh and if and

419
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,199
if carlos

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,839
if you said that then i missed it but um

421
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
i took from this slide that capture

422
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,199
portal is an application and uh they

423
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
consider it they consider a

424
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
repeatable stable mac to be a

425
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,279
requirement for a captive portal

426
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,440
so i think i think they're still

427
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
fair

428
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,759
widely separable

429
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,320
problems but perhaps there's you know

430
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,279
stuff that i don't understand

431
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,079
correct

432
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,320
so eric michael richardson here again so

433
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
if you build a layer 2 protocol that

434
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
uses the current encryption to update

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
the access point with the new your new

436
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,320
address or your intended new address

437
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
okay if you don't also build a protocol

438
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
that spreads that all to the control

439
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,680
mechanism the captive portal enforcement

440
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
point which may be beyond that and all

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
the other access points

442
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
that need to know that then the problem

443
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
is is that well you tell captive access

444
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
point one

445
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,400
your new intended

446
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
information and then you walk to the

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,839
other

448
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,439
room and then the other access point

449
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
doesn't know who you are so it's not

450
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,119
enough to do a protocol between a

451
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,919
station and an access point right you

452
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,439
have to do all of the rest of the

453
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
infrastructure and the rest of those

454
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
protocols are either proprietary

455
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,840
or not even known by the ieee

456
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,159
right

457
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
well how can it

458
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,520
i mean you have to do more than that

459
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
right you have to do a lot more than

460
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,480
that is what i'm trying to say to make a

461
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
workable solution okay and what i'm

462
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
saying is that i don't think that that

463
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
that the protocols that need to be

464
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,840
updated

465
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,799
are even represented in that group

466
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,799
okay

467
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
eric link

468
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
um

469
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
michael you know for sure that there is

470
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
an articley ietf coordination mailing

471
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
recent group that you are meeting

472
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,919
sometimes if not mistaken you are part

473
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
of it even so there's something to be

474
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,039
maybe

475
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,640
i want to say escalated and it'd be too

476
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
strong a world but at least mentioned

477
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
okay thank you let's

478
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,320
move on to the next

479
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
this

480
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
i guess

481
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,919
if you don't mind i will be presenting

482
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
from here because i

483
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,919
otherwise i don't have a easy way to

484
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
switch the slides

485
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
so this is an update on the mac address

486
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,080
randomization state state of the first

487
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,960
draft this is version 02

488
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
authored by myself uh juan carlos and

489
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
amelia

490
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,480
so well again uh just a quick recap on

491
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,200
the on the introduction on goals so well

492
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
we know how madina's or why madinah was

493
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,160
chartered and the goal of this draft is

494
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
basically to document what are the

495
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
different

496
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,360
uh efforts and activities that are being

497
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
done on uh itf ieee

498
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
mobile os vendors of aba regarding the

499
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,440
bank address randomization

500
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,880
so that's the the overall goal

501
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,400
this is the table of contents uh it's

502
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,520
the same that

503
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
that we had in the in the previous

504
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
version and i'm i'm highlighting their

505
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,280
section seven which is basically

506
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,200
documenting what the

507
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
mainstream or operating systems are

508
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
doing regarding

509
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
random address

510
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,919
micro random mac address

511
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,559
and how they use them and we discussed

512
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,960
this in the previous meeting that was

513
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
the main point of discussion regarding

514
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
this graph in atf 113

515
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
and we agreed that

516
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
since this is the kind of dynamic

517
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,640
content that it both because the

518
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
operating systems are evolving what they

519
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,360
do

520
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,400
on the us as they move along

521
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
we have moved that to a github

522
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
content

523
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
that is basically there

524
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
and we have

525
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
added a link to the github on the draft

526
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
and as you see this is the github

527
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
content

528
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,120
and

529
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,799
we don't know yet if this is the best

530
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,880
way of doing this this is kind of new

531
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
but it's a way to do it so let's try how

532
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
it works

533
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,799
and i would appreciate if you

534
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,520
detect any content that is not accurate

535
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
we already have some comments in the

536
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
previous version

537
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
pointing at

538
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
pointing us to some things that we need

539
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,679
to modify

540
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,320
since this is live if you see anything

541
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,280
you can either contact us mainly list

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
get pull requests whatever you think to

543
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
keep the document updated and as

544
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
complete as we think is needed

545
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
then just a quick summary of the

546
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
different parts of the document we have

547
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
one part regarding the activities of the

548
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
at the itf

549
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
this

550
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,520
goes back as

551
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,480
even itf 91 where we started to look

552
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,919
into this problem and the different

553
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
experiments that were done in different

554
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
itf meetings

555
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
as well as related work in different

556
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
rfcs regarding the

557
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
anonymization or randomization of some

558
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
identifiers

559
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
then we have of course the activities in

560
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,840
ieee and jc has just updated us on some

561
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
of the activities together with their

562
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,240
own

563
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
and

564
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
we also have the activities as the waba

565
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,559
that as we have had in past meetings

566
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,919
they are very active and looking into

567
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,280
this topic and of course we need to be

568
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,720
coordinated with with them

569
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,720
then there is this part about the

570
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
different os current practices so we

571
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
focus on android and ios as mobile

572
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
operating systems and we try to document

573
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
what they they do in terms of how they

574
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
what are the identifiers that you use

575
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
for scanning how they identify the mac

576
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
addresses that they use when they are

577
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
associated

578
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,799
change depending on whether we switch to

579
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,600
a different network or whether we rotate

580
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
that periodically these type of

581
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
practices are trying to be captured

582
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
there

583
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
and we also have some analysis of

584
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,679
kind of what we will desktop operating

585
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,720
systems

586
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,039
like linux and windows 10 also

587
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
documenting what they do

588
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,880
at the time that we were doing these

589
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
tests and this is why this is a part

590
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
that we want to keep alive

591
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,880
as things may change

592
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,559
with the new versions of the operating

593
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,880
systems

594
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
and this is just the chain lock so from

595
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
the previous version the main change is

596
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,280
to move the section 7 to the github and

597
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
again please

598
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
any update or anything that you think we

599
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
need to cover

600
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
let us know

601
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
and that's it from my side

602
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,240
then we can switch to the next

603
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
with an item any comments

604
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
any comments for carlos

605
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,240
yes

606
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,039
[Music]

607
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
this is daniel gilmore sorry i didn't

608
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,280
press the button i i my

609
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,919
link is not great um

610
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
uh so i'm not sure that i understand the

611
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
goal of moving the section all the way

612
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
to the to github instead of having a

613
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
point in time and a link to github

614
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,559
um is the idea that when this is

615
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,400
published is the intent to publish this

616
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
as an rfc

617
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
yes the idea is that uh as we can

618
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,000
publish that at some point in the time

619
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,159
and things may evolve we have some part

620
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,080
of the document or some part linked to

621
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,320
the document that can evolve

622
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,679
so is the intent i just want to

623
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,440
understand is the intent

624
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
to publish the snapshot when this goes

625
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,400
out as an rfc that also includes a link

626
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
to github for other updates okay makes

627
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,520
sense thank you

628
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
michael great again and daniel that's

629
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
it's been this kind of technique has

630
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
been approved by the ig for a couple of

631
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
cases like this because once you i mean

632
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,120
i receive kevin stone right and this one

633
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
will be stopped to be updated maybe in

634
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,360
10 years only

635
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
michael richardson um so what i would

636
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,039
like to see and i propose to pull a

637
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,080
request against this github uh

638
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,760
the document in the github um

639
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
is that we come up with a set of

640
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
standardized terminology a taxonomy of

641
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
the different mechanisms i don't want to

642
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
describe

643
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,799
you know the thing that android does in

644
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,559
2019

645
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
i want to give it a name

646
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,360
okay

647
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
and then it simply becomes a question of

648
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,960
of you know labeling each thing

649
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
and you know version whatever blah blah

650
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
blah you know

651
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
and uh and that's it and we should have

652
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
we should have you know that should you

653
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
know get home people can do an update

654
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,080
and we might revise the document at some

655
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
point and pull in another snapshot or

656
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
something like that

657
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
but to me we should be arguing about the

658
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,559
taxonomy

659
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,720
and we should be figuring out whether

660
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
there's something we've missed

661
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,559
something that someone's thinking of

662
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
doing but thought was a bad idea

663
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,440
or something even something that someone

664
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
tried and turned out to be a bad idea

665
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,559
right so we can give it a name

666
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
and actually say okay

667
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
don't do that

668
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,279
or only do it in this environment right

669
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,760
thanks michael

670
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,039
so let's move to the rom

671
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,960
and i will pass you the control jerome

672
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
thank you hello everyone

673
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
um so this is updates on the other

674
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
document that we've been working on

675
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,960
which is the use case document and as

676
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,559
you you may remember

677
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,880
um by the way this is the link to the uh

678
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
document as it is posted now um what

679
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,760
this document was about is to try to

680
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
create a framework around the

681
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
conversations uh exactly to michael's

682
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
point a second ago

683
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
about putting names on different

684
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
concepts we're manipulating and looking

685
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,200
at the landscape of what's happening

686
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
around this rcm and identification

687
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,679
and it's of course as you you may

688
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,960
remember a little bit complicated

689
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,559
because there are multiple

690
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
type of devices uh type of actors you

691
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,880
know from those who observe those who

692
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,159
act the network operators etc um and

693
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,760
also different types of environment from

694
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,080
home to enterprise to public venues etc

695
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,880
so

696
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,760
what this document does is to list these

697
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,559
different elements that act together

698
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
and try to define some use cases where

699
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,799
rcm is encountered

700
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
and to do so we also try to establish a

701
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
trust variable

702
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,960
which is you know typically never set to

703
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,080
full trust but has a range of distrust

704
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
now depending on environment and who may

705
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
be observing the other communications

706
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,679
um

707
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
so we've been i'm very short on this

708
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,480
because we've been discussing this

709
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,960
document for for a while now um we

710
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,080
stopped last time at v1 when we moved

711
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
that document from

712
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
a contribution into a document that the

713
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
group has adopted um and in v2 what we

714
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,039
wanted to do when that document is

715
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,840
posted now is to look at some

716
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,760
solutions that we may see in the

717
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,399
industry uh to address use cases around

718
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
rcm and identification

719
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,360
um

720
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
as you may remember at the end of the

721
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,039
document the previous version of the

722
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,279
document the last section

723
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,520
was recapitulating some requirements

724
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
that you know we discussed in the group

725
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,600
and thought that could be applicable to

726
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
different use cases i've put them here

727
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
so you can go back to them and read them

728
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,720
as you prepare questions or as you

729
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
review this presentation

730
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
and there were eight of them primarily

731
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
and as we look into this document and we

732
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,360
started looking into the state of the

733
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
industry um we realized that some of

734
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,760
these requirements probably cannot be

735
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,120
met today

736
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
for example

737
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,559
uh there is this idea of let me go back

738
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,600
to slides ago on this first requirement

739
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,080
that says uh network should not make any

740
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,600
assumption about the client mac address

741
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,559
persistence which means that the change

742
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,200
that mac address can change at any time

743
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,399
uh today for example in the 802.11 uh

744
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,440
structure

745
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
this is not allowed

746
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
you cannot change your mac address and

747
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,919
maintain a session that's going to go

748
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,399
away however we know that one of the two

749
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,840
groups that juan carlos mentioned a27bi

750
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
is looking at this idea of session

751
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,440
continuity while the mac address is

752
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,240
changing so that type of requirement

753
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
might you know get onto a new life as

754
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,720
you know progress is made in that group

755
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
however some other of the requirements

756
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,559
uh we think uh have already been

757
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,880
thought about or or looked into by some

758
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
elements of the market uh you may recall

759
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
that in the previous uh

760
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,559
meeting we had wba liaison telling us

761
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
about a white paper they wrote about

762
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
some scenarios where identification

763
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,120
would be possible uh needed or not

764
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,919
wanted um in particular one one thing

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,360
they were addressing that we thought

766
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,799
would be a very useful is this idea that

767
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
you could have an association that could

768
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,760
protect the identity of the user um

769
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,279
during which you know the mac address

770
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,679
will not play any important role anymore

771
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,520
now you know not abstain you know even

772
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
bi of course and that would be simply

773
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
because it would be protected you know

774
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
the connection would be protected by

775
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,480
identification of the user um not you

776
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,559
know necessarily the device itself and

777
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,399
the link to the access point would be

778
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,960
protected and encrypted

779
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
one such uh protocol is of course you

780
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,760
know something we know it's 1x or pa2.pa

781
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
3. but they were also mentioning an

782
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
interesting standard that they have been

783
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
pushing for a couple of years now which

784
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
is called open roaming

785
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,159
by which a a user can connect to a

786
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,039
network stay anonymous to that network

787
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,880
while still being authenticated to a

788
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
third-party authentication authority

789
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,640
which merely returns to the local menu

790
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,399
this user is valid although you don't

791
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,159
know his data

792
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,559
is detailed so this user is valid um

793
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,240
allowing those you know the user to be

794
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
connecting while still being you know

795
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
private to the visa video in that

796
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
scenario of course there is a sort of a

797
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
possibility of traceability when need be

798
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,480
uh because we know who is the

799
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
authentication authority but the user

800
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
identity itself will not be exposed the

801
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
mac address itself becomes irrelevant

802
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
and therefore the rotation would become

803
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
possible you know either through

804
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
disconnection or reconnection which is

805
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
what would happen today

806
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
or you know if 11bi concludes on its

807
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
work with a continuity of of session

808
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,679
so that's a one element that we thought

809
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,760
could be useful to our use cases so in

810
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
the new version v02 of this document

811
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
we have a little section that describes

812
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
uh the solution and you know how we

813
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,600
couldn't tell in the different scenarios

814
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
that we were exploring the document this

815
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,679
is of course just one you know we think

816
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,640
that there are

817
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,080
plenty of other

818
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,000
standards that could be useful for us

819
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
plenty of rfcs that could be useful for

820
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,640
us to explore in particular in the world

821
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,760
of

822
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
dhep eep reduce and some others where it

823
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,440
may be that some identifiers are sent

824
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
and these identifiers may be identifiers

825
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
of the station

826
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
or the user uh it could be interesting

827
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
to look a little bit deeper into how

828
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
these uh intersect with these

829
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,360
requirements that we have at the end of

830
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,279
the document so i would like you know to

831
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,480
encourage you to to look at this

832
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,320
document again especially the last

833
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,559
section as it's what is new we also

834
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
corrected a couple of typos but the main

835
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,720
thing is the uh this new section and you

836
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
know provide feedback here on the list

837
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,799
or or to us the authors uh so that we

838
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,200
can continue making progress in looking

839
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,799
into the landscape and and looking at

840
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,600
what solutions are available

841
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,880
any questions

842
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,039
i don't see anyone

843
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,519
in the queue

844
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,159
comments

845
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
then i think well

846
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,799
i think we need to

847
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,720
to get some feedback on the melee dates

848
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,399
and reviews

849
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,120
i'll try to provide one as an individual

850
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
before the next iteration so

851
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,320
and then

852
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,559
hopefully we'll get some additional

853
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,519
reviews and we will move it from there

854
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,320
okay thank you very much

855
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,240
so then we can move to the next

856
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
slide let me

857
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,399
which is about the

858
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,440
roaming

859
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,440
experiment

860
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
can you hear me

861
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,600
yes

862
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
sorry it takes a

863
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
there's a little lag with the buttons

864
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,480
here so

865
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
this is just an update or a heads up

866
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,360
rather for the group about

867
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
an idea that has been discussed with

868
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
wpa

869
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,399
regarding a open roaming experiment

870
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,440
so open roaming as you may know is this

871
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
technology that is based on passport

872
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,240
that

873
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
allows

874
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,080
wi-fi to connect to a to a new network

875
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,880
without necessarily providing the

876
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,760
uh for the user providing the the

877
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
the

878
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
the password every time or or or

879
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,799
requesting credentials etc but rather

880
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,480
that the the authentication

881
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,000
authorization is done

882
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,039
uh through

883
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,000
passpoint uh just like uh

884
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,720
like eduroam would work for instance or

885
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,600
uh

886
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
other scenarios where you know uh the

887
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
user beforehand

888
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,480
so in this case uh the wba is putting in

889
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
place this federation that

890
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,240
allows multiple identity providers to

891
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,440
use different network providers and then

892
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,760
the users can connect to two new

893
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
networks by

894
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,519
uh just uh having an authenticated

895
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,199
exchange with the with the identity

896
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,480
provider

897
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,440
so

898
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,159
um this is of course something relevant

899
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
to to us because

900
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
uh it does not rely on the mac address

901
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,760
uh randomization and it uses

902
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,639
both ieee 802 and itf standards already

903
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,560
so this is something that we would like

904
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,520
to explore to see first of all how

905
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
how

906
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
robust it is and then how much we can

907
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
rely on it for for the use cases that

908
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,359
we're discussing

909
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,159
so seems uh relevant to to have

910
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,639
something to try at uh at an ietf

911
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
meeting hands-on and for that reason we

912
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,879
were discussing the possibility of

913
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
running it at an upcoming meeting that

914
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
could be london or some other meeting

915
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
to give you an idea

916
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,160
this is the

917
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
the slide that they they provided were

918
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,240
where you have on the on the left hand

919
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
side the

920
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
open roaming identity providers

921
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,119
which could be

922
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,040
uh of course a service provider but

923
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
could also be a

924
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
you know a mobile operator a cable

925
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,119
operator an isp or some other

926
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,560
uh

927
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,520
cloud provider for instance or uh

928
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,359
even a

929
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
goods provider you know so it could be

930
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,440
your car your best uh your preferred

931
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,680
coffee shop or you could be the one that

932
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,000
is hosting your

933
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
your uh

934
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
information in the cloud and on the

935
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
right hand side is the network providers

936
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
which are the ones deploying the actual

937
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
access points so in the middle

938
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,960
we have this open roaming infrastructure

939
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,440
that allows to exchange these

940
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,160
credentials with 1x and then be

941
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
authenticated

942
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,839
so for the experiment what we would like

943
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,599
to do is

944
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
of course use the idf

945
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,560
network on one hand and perhaps

946
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
rely on idf

947
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
as an identity provider

948
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,880
besides of course existing ones

949
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,599
but

950
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,240
for that because ietf is aware and well

951
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,200
known for for the usage of uh of the

952
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,760
network the access network and also we

953
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
already have some infrastructure in

954
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,920
place through data tracker for instance

955
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
uh to identify users sounds like this

956
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
could be an interesting experiment to

957
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,079
run so anyway just to give you a heads

958
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,160
up that this discussion is going on and

959
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,920
uh we still have to

960
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,320
boil a few details before we can

961
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,880
call a goal but

962
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,280
better to to give you a heads up of this

963
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,839
discussion uh michael

964
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,240
um michael richards on the mic so um i

965
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,960
think i remember once we tried to do

966
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
something

967
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
different but similar concepts in the

968
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,960
ietf network and one of the things that

969
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,680
quite reasonably someone said is

970
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,520
did you pass it did you get an ethics

971
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,000
committee and did you get consent

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,119
and uh

973
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,440
and people said oh and then we did it

974
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,400
again the next year the next iets so

975
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,839
just to mention that's actually

976
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,119
something that

977
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,359
we probably actually have to do

978
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,680
and in some jurisdictions it's not not

979
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,720
uh not optional really not optional

980
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,520
um

981
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
so just something not to forget that

982
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
yeah we think we can do experiments on

983
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,640
ourselves but

984
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,160
uh we still need to ask for consent

985
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,400
and we need may need to actually

986
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,960
particularly for pii we may actually

987
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
need to

988
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
have a real clear plan of what we're

989
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
doing with that

990
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
thanks so i'm really excited to do it

991
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,599
though

992
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
yes thanks uh and indeed uh part of the

993
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,240
the discussion was uh

994
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
okay let's open up the ietf network to

995
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
these providers but then

996
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
of course people may not

997
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,560
trust the existing providers so that's

998
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
why we we started exploring having ietf

999
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,119
itself as an identity provider for

1000
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,800
people that don't necessarily have a

1001
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,079
relationship or want to have a

1002
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,200
relationship

1003
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,040
with the other providers

1004
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720
so the idea is

1005
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
for the same infrastructure to to handle

1006
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
the different situations but

1007
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,800
but your point about the gun the the

1008
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,520
consent is is well taken and this is

1009
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
definitely something we will discuss so

1010
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,078
thanks a lot for that

1011
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
any other comments

1012
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,839
or questions

1013
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,960
okay

1014
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,040
okay so thank you very much

1015
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
okay let's move to the

1016
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
next last point in the agenda

1017
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
are you are you connected

1018
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,520
or is so i see you connected can you

1019
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,960
speak okay

1020
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,359
let me

1021
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,640
project your slides

1022
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
and i will give you

1023
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,180
control

1024
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,239
[Music]

1025
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
can i hear you can you

1026
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
try to speak

1027
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,880
yeah now we can

1028
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
please go ahead

1029
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,359
okay

1030
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,598
so

1031
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
so

1032
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,359
hello everyone my name is

1033
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,280
rty university and today i'm gonna

1034
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,280
introduce savvy wlan briefly

1035
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
the title of this draft is

1036
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,599
a savvy solution for w uh wireless lan

1037
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,560
uh here is the outline of my

1038
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,000
presentation first let's go to the

1039
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,480
background

1040
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
the goal of study

1041
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,720
is to ensure the hosts attached to the

1042
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,280
scene that link cannot prove each

1043
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,440
other's idea justice without

1044
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,680
disrupting the city's legitimate traffic

1045
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,000
to enable network

1046
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,119
operators to deploy fine green ipos

1047
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,800
address validation without dependency

1048
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,440
supportive functionality or hosts the

1049
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
service method was designed

1050
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
to purely

1051
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,040
network

1052
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,760
perception instance enforcers helps the

1053
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,359
use of legitimate ips software address

1054
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,760
according to the following three step

1055
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,960
model

1056
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,359
first the first step is to

1057
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,680
identify which ips what also suggests

1058
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,880
addresses are made for a host

1059
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
based on monitoring package exchanged by

1060
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
user hosts

1061
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,599
the second one is to blind let's buying

1062
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,520
a let's make i adjust to the link layer

1063
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,040
property of the host network attachment

1064
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,119
this property

1065
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,240
is called

1066
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
ending anchor

1067
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,359
must be verifiable in every package that

1068
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,200
is the whole system

1069
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,960
and harder tools

1070
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,119
than the host ip so suggested efl

1071
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,920
thursday the third step is to enforce

1072
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,359
that ips address in package

1073
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,319
the and the anchors to which they were

1074
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,640
bound

1075
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,119
next let's move to the savvy solution

1076
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,160
for

1077
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,680
the various

1078
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,240
solution

1079
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,720
and this is a high-level overview of the

1080
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
study for wireless lan

1081
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,319
the bending anchor in savvy blue land

1082
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,359
is mac address which should be secured

1083
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,319
by

1084
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,839
dot 11i

1085
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,240
and or other mechanisms

1086
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,119
when the user configures an ip address

1087
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,280
the access point and the access

1088
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,920
controller perform address assignment

1089
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,040
smoking

1090
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,960
for you for example

1091
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,760
through

1092
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,920
duplicate class detection

1093
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,880
or

1094
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,599
the dhcp procedure

1095
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,880
then the access point synchronizes nav

1096
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
mac and ip addresses through

1097
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,880
cap web extension with access controller

1098
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,520
and the access controller confirms the

1099
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
legitimacy of demanding entries when

1100
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
receiving packages

1101
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
from the user device the access point

1102
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
and the access controller can enforce

1103
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,319
the

1104
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,040
entry by filtering the spoofing package

1105
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,000
um

1106
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,400
there are two data structures used in

1107
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,839
wlan

1108
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,680
the first one is

1109
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,520
mac

1110
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,480
mapping table and this table maps ip

1111
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,240
addresses to their corresponding mac

1112
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,359
addresses

1113
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,040
and it is used in the control process

1114
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,760
and ipl address can have only one

1115
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,599
corresponding mega address

1116
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,599
different ip addresses can be mapped to

1117
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,920
the same mac address

1118
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,760
the second one is map mac mapping table

1119
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,880
it maps add mac addresses to the

1120
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,280
corresponding ip addresses

1121
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,480
it is used for filtering

1122
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,520
a mac address can be mapped to

1123
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
now multiple active addresses

1124
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,520
both the mac ip mapping table and the

1125
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,880
mac mapping table can be maintained

1126
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,560
separately on different devices

1127
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,480
so a

1128
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,119
synchronization mechanism that must be

1129
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:03,920
used

1130
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,160
between these two tables to ensure the

1131
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,598
consistency of landings

1132
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,960
as mentioned about

1133
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,480
the bending anchor

1134
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,839
used

1135
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,560
in vwlan is the

1136
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,760
mac address

1137
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,640
but

1138
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
it should be

1139
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
secured by

1140
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,000
11i or other

1141
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,680
secure mechanisms

1142
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,240
if the mac address is unprotected

1143
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,119
attacker can support the mac address to

1144
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,400
validation successfully

1145
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,280
as for bending and incorporation there

1146
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,520
are three types of scenarios

1147
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,359
first one is static

1148
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,079
all the static ip mac address pairs are

1149
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
configured configured

1150
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,079
into the ipmax

1151
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,760
mapping table with a mechanism enabled

1152
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
second one is

1153
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,000
through dhcp

1154
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,960
the staffing instances instance or

1155
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,720
devices

1156
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,839
snoop the on the dsdp adjuster's name

1157
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,280
and process between the attached host

1158
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,440
and this server

1159
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,680
the second the third one is slack

1160
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,839
savvy devices snoops uh smoking

1161
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,400
duplicate adjust detection procedure or

1162
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,240
adjust resolution

1163
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,400
procedure between attached hosts and

1164
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,880
neighbors

1165
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,480
there are three types of situations for

1166
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,119
funding clearing the first one is a host

1167
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,040
leaves explicitly in this access point

1168
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,400
and in this case

1169
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,359
all

1170
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,079
entries in the mac ip mapping table

1171
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,160
essentially associated with this mac

1172
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,560
address must be cleared the second one

1173
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,440
is a

1174
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,040
dscp release messages received from the

1175
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,880
owner of the

1176
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
corresponding ip address

1177
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,839
this

1178
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,319
ip entry in the

1179
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,560
mapping table and the corresponding

1180
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,599
entries in the mac ip mapping table must

1181
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,880
be cleared the third one is a mr message

1182
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,319
of the essays

1183
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,079
access controllers

1184
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,560
client id time is received

1185
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,200
in this case all entries in the mac item

1186
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,640
mapping table related to the mac address

1187
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,520
must be cleared

1188
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,760
sorry

1189
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,680
um

1190
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,560
so

1191
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,680
the core of the suspect validation in

1192
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,880
wireless lan is to look up two tables

1193
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,680
on mac ip mapping table and ip mac

1194
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,440
mapping table

1195
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,760
to check whether the corresponding entry

1196
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,440
exists

1197
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,640
due to time constraints i will i want is

1198
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,200
done here

1199
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,640
there are two uh deploying scenarios the

1200
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,920
first one is

1201
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,560
uh centralized wireless lan

1202
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
which consists of

1203
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,400
access points and access controllers

1204
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,839
in this case

1205
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,280
there are two types of filtering

1206
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240
cases the first one is ap

1207
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,520
perform

1208
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
access point of performance

1209
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,160
filtering

1210
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,599
in this case access controllers

1211
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,160
uh maintain an ip mac

1212
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,920
mapping table well

1213
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,800
access point maintains uh hack ip

1214
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,280
mapping table and perform address

1215
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,920
smoking the second one is access

1216
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,079
controller performance

1217
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,480
field active field

1218
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,680
class controller maintains both mac ip

1219
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,760
mapping table and the ipmax mapping

1220
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,720
table

1221
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,680
and

1222
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,240
you perform both address smoking and

1223
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,760
pack filtering

1224
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,240
in this case so all the package must be

1225
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,480
forwarded to the access controller

1226
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
firstly

1227
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,599
uh this slide

1228
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,480
presents a mobility solution when a user

1229
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,599
moves to another uh access point the

1230
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,280
following access point

1231
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,480
point will first request the ip address

1232
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
corresponding to the mac address

1233
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400
of course there may be

1234
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,200
a synchronization between

1235
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,240
access controllers

1236
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,720
the second the one

1237
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,559
and the second one

1238
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,880
scenario is that

1239
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,200
autonomous wireless lan which consists

1240
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,319
of

1241
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,240
fat access points

1242
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,000
that access point maintains both mac ip

1243
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,920
mapping table and

1244
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,559
ip mac mapping table and performs both

1245
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,480
adjust node pin and packet filtering

1246
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,000
so uh how will mac address randomization

1247
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
affect savvywm the invalid slab

1248
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,119
uh randomness addresses are

1249
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,319
mainly used for discovering various

1250
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,680
networks

1251
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,640
accessing networks and communicating

1252
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,000
we announced

1253
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,559
the impact of max adjust

1254
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,160
randomization on a savvy wlan and in

1255
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,720
this in these cases

1256
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,720
and found that the anchor point

1257
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,319
by the anchor of

1258
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,800
the savvy dublin

1259
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,839
is stable during one access as a

1260
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,559
savvy

1261
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,000
for wireless lan function will work well

1262
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,160
so the next step

1263
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,599
we are wondering so where to promote

1264
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,720
this work uh

1265
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,079
maybe there uh we can promote this work

1266
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,880
in madness or

1267
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,160
interrum

1268
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,800
working group and we

1269
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
solicit comments under

1270
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,319
the next step is we we will

1271
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,000
uh

1272
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,200
solid statement comments and refine the

1273
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
draft

1274
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,680
okay

1275
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,440
thank you

1276
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,480
very much any comments

1277
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,839
i have a clarifying question i did not

1278
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,000
read your document so can you go back to

1279
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,640
slide 6

1280
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,520
slide 6

1281
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,680
so again i'm trying to understand right

1282
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,280
where exactly is the validation that's

1283
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,400
happening

1284
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,520
so if i understand correctly

1285
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,000
you're using cap extension to carry

1286
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
something which says that okay first

1287
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,559
thing you're snooping the dhcp

1288
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,359
transactions or dad packets based on

1289
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,240
that

1290
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,680
you are forming a relationship between

1291
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,680
the ip address and the mac address and

1292
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,960
that information you are pushing it to

1293
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,359
the access point or kappa is that my

1294
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,839
understanding correct

1295
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,000
this information is maintained

1296
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,359
can be maintained

1297
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,760
in access point and

1298
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,720
access controllers

1299
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,920
so if a subsequent if there's another

1300
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,160
let's say an attacker who is trying to

1301
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,400
use the same ip address where do you do

1302
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,160
the enforcement is it on the ap or on

1303
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,558
the ac

1304
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,879
usually we can enforce

1305
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,000
university in access point

1306
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,480
uh

1307
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,680
but if you uh in the centralized

1308
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,559
wireless lan we can

1309
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,760
we can

1310
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,390
enforce it in

1311
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,680
[Music]

1312
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,880
uh

1313
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,400
we can enforce it

1314
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,760
in that access point

1315
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,119
the second

1316
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,880
but you can also impose it in access

1317
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,079
controller

1318
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,200
in the autonomous

1319
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,160
autonomous wireless lan you can enforce

1320
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,960
it in that access point

1321
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,200
but in autonomous mode your dhcp

1322
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,559
transactions are not coming to the

1323
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,720
access controller so how do you know the

1324
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,040
state

1325
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,040
uh

1326
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,240
so you mean um

1327
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,200
you mean the dhtp package do not go to

1328
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,280
access controller

1329
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,040
so it depends on the mode so the

1330
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,119
question is is the assumption that all

1331
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,920
your dhcp sorry sorry sorry i think for

1332
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,200
the sake of time maybe we need to move

1333
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,800
that discussion to the mailing list

1334
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,640
because we still have some questions

1335
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,319
from yeah

1336
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,119
okay all right

1337
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,680
eric klein

1338
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,880
um on slide seven the next slide

1339
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
okay

1340
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,920
thank you

1341
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,280
uh do you support ipv6

1342
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,240
uh yes

1343
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,280
uh

1344
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,760
before and v6

1345
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,599
uh okay so uh with what uh i think the

1346
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,440
third sub bullet of the first bullet how

1347
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,839
do you support ipv6 anycast addresses

1348
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,040
uh and the cast pitchers

1349
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,040
rfcc

1350
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,079
so so you mean

1351
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,960
any cash addresses cannot be

1352
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,079
supported here so your question is

1353
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,040
uh how savvy double land supported the

1354
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,079
support

1355
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,359
the

1356
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,599
uh and the ending has ipv6 addresses

1357
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,119
uh yeah i was wondering because you can

1358
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,640
have um

1359
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,839
the same ip v6 address have multiple

1360
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,680
uh mac addresses

1361
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,480
if the if the uh override flag is zero

1362
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,839
so

1363
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,000
um this is a quick question

1364
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,520
it's doing snooping and i'm assuming

1365
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,040
sorry this is to michael this is doing

1366
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,160
snooping right and i'm assuming it's um

1367
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,200
populating some table

1368
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,319
sorry michael the queue is close well

1369
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,640
yeah yeah maybe this i'll just uh yeah

1370
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,559
i don't think it's supported as a source

1371
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,760
because he's got to snoop the source

1372
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,079
address not the destination address

1373
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,760
i think

1374
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,160
yeah yeah it is

1375
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,720
a source address

1376
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,959
thank you

1377
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,520
okay juan carlos

1378
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,280
hi um

1379
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,280
i was just trying to to get to the to

1380
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,119
the questions that uh

1381
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,040
uh are being asked at the end whether

1382
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,880
this is something that

1383
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,200
should be discussed in medina's or or

1384
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,079
interior so at the moment doesn't

1385
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,160
seem to me clear that this is in the

1386
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,280
charter of madina's of course the the it

1387
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
is uh

1388
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,160
relevant to to the discussions we've

1389
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,000
been having but uh because we are right

1390
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,880
now more at the at the survey stage and

1391
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,960
gap analysis uh i don't think that we

1392
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
can dig into

1393
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,520
into

1394
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,160
this space this option space right now

1395
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,920
so now i would

1396
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,799
rather hear a discussion going to the

1397
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
mailing list before we we derailed too

1398
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,319
much the

1399
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,200
the scope that we have right now

1400
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,040
okay thanks

1401
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,480
thanks

1402
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
eric think and sorry for joining the

1403
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,720
queue once it's closed

1404
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,359
uh but indeed i do not see this draft as

1405
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,119
becoming or fitting the charter of

1406
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,119
malinas

1407
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,359
so the default thing mostly would be

1408
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,119
interior

1409
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,400
or perhaps a dispatch

1410
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,280
okay thanks okay thanks

1411
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,040
so let's then quickly move to the

1412
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,440
next steps so i would like to uh in this

1413
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,640
two minutes that we have for three

1414
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,640
minutes i would like to get some

1415
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,200
volunteers for reviewing the the traps

1416
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,359
that we the working group drafts that we

1417
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,160
have i already volunteer for reviewing

1418
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,880
the

1419
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,440
use cases and requirements

1420
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,520
i think in order to move along it would

1421
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,280
be good to get one or two reviews per

1422
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,799
document

1423
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,960
so any volunteers here of course we will

1424
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,839
be asking that on the main

1425
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,559
list

1426
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,880
i see michael going to the microphone

1427
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,640
michael richardson here um i'd like to

1428
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,480
suggest the chairs we have a virtual

1429
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,920
interim before

1430
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,200
london

1431
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,720
um and that yeah we need to do reviews

1432
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,119
on the mailing list we made progress we

1433
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,480
haven't really done anything since the

1434
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,880
last itf so i think that's a really good

1435
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,319
solution

1436
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,000
um i've read them all and i

1437
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,240
would like to

1438
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,200
i would like to have a bigger

1439
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,839
conversation about what's in them um

1440
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:44,720
there

1441
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,880
okay thanks we we take note of that and

1442
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,319
we will discuss

1443
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,240
with the idea and see

1444
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,760
next step but that's

1445
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,280
good feedback

1446
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,000
and uh jerome and you are in line i

1447
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
think one thing we can do meanwhile is

1448
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,960
that

1449
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,160
if you can uh review the

1450
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,240
the other charter item well i reviewed

1451
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,160
yours i think we can benefit from some

1452
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,319
cross reviews in the meantime if you

1453
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,480
don't mind

1454
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,280
and

1455
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,880
do you see any any additional comments

1456
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,559
before we go in these two minutes

1457
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,720
no jerome do you have something to say

1458
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,400
no we'll do thank you carlos and yeah

1459
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,240
please review will a great idea to have

1460
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,760
an interim in between

1461
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,599
we may continue augmenting the draft in

1462
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,599
in between but you know input will be

1463
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,200
very very welcome

1464
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,520
okay thanks

1465
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,880
so so maybe the the very last comment uh

1466
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,480
i think in michael's point about an

1467
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,880
interim is a very good one uh

1468
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,000
i'm just wondering uh after the

1469
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,480
vacation summer vacation period uh

1470
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,720
september october

1471
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,319
early october probably is a good time

1472
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,558
for me

1473
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
but we can discuss this on the on the

1474
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,200
mailing list

1475
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,280
okay so if there are no more comments

1476
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,559
we can

1477
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,680
close the meeting thank you very much

1478
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,079

thanks everyone

1481
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,920
well

1482
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,480
hello
