1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
uh

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
good morning everyone welcome to the

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
mock buff

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,399
i think we'll get started in just a

5
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
minute so

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,000
find your seats

7
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,480
i'm thinking

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,880
foreign

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,400
okay folks uh let's get started for

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
those of you who haven't seen gritty

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
before the

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
delightful figure in front of you is the

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,159
mascot of the philadelphia flyers and a

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
beloved figure there in philadelphia

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
i regret that i'm not able to join you

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
myself unfortunately i managed to blow

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
out my back right before getting on the

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,119
plane uh and the combination didn't seem

19
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,759
like a good one

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
so uh you are ably represented in the

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,960
room by my colleague alan alan say hi

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,119
hello good morning everyone

23
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
alan will be handling all of the um

24
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
in-room q management etc and we'll be

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,959
trying to drive the sleds and this

26
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,720
together

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
first and foremost note well

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,360
uh something not on the note well but

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
we've been asked to emphasize for those

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
of you in the room is that it is very

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
important to keep your masks on

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
if you need to actively eat or drink

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,959
please

34
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
step into the hall and do that but while

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
you're in the room please leave your

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
mask on unless you're actively speaking

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
at one of the mics and i think you'll

38
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
find that the mics are sensitive enough

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
that you'll be able to um to be heard

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
just fine if you choose to leave them on

41
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,440
even there

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
uh the noteworld that you see let me

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
just jump in real quick ted and say i

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,760
think i see a few folks maybe not

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
wearing masks so just double check if

46
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,800
you can touch your face and there's not

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,239
a mask there

48
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,720
try to fix that

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,239
go ahead

50
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,120
uh

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
uh somebody noted in the chat that it

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
appears they're getting a little bit of

53
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
distortion from my mic i've moved it a

54
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
little bit further away hopefully that

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,959
helps

56
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
um this is the note well uh since we're

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,640
wednesday of the week you've probably

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
seen it before but just as a reminder uh

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
please

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
note that you are responsible for

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
maintaining

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
your conduct according to

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
each of the bcps you see

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
listed below

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
this is our agenda first i want to say

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
thank you to

67
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
hunter and to luke

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
lucas

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
will be taking notes locally and

70
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
uploading them later and lucas is sorry

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
luca is uh

72
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
doing um a backup there so we do have

73
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
scribes we very much appreciate that

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
uh the second thing to remind you is

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
that because this is a buff there will

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
be a set of buff questions you'll see a

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,239
preview in just a moment that means that

78
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
we will be using the question tool

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
that's part of the

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,280
uh the system the show of hands tool uh

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
if you're on the the desktop system it's

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
between the bell and the file folder

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
uh looks like a little um

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,080
chart

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
so please make sure that if you're in

86
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
the room uh that you're also logged in

87
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,519
to one of the the meet echo systems

88
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,358
so that you're able to participate in

89
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,320
those questions

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,639
uh

91
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
i think this is a pretty standard agenda

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,320
for above and that we're going to go

93
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
through

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
the charter

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
we'll then have discussion and then go

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
through the buff questions and time

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
permitting and if it still seems

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
appropriate

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
there's a technical presentation which

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
was volunteered

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
are there any questions on the agenda

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
seeing none

103
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
here is

104
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
a preview of the buff question so these

105
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
are the questions that we'll be asking

106
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
the community

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
after we've gone through the charter

108
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
so each of you please

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,759
as you're considering the charter or

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
changes you'd like to see in it or

111
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
discussion about it make sure that you

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
keep in mind these questions does the

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
community think that the problem

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
statement is clear well scoped solvable

115
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
and useful

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
we will then ask

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
for folks willing to review the document

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
or comment on the mailing list if a

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,799
working group is formed

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
will then ask if a working group should

121
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
be formed

122
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
uh and then we'll ask anybody who

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
doesn't think it should be formed if

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
they want to address the buff to express

125
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,479
their concerns

126
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
so those are the questions that you

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
should have in mind as we go through the

128
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
charter

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
the charter has been broken up into uh

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
different sections uh to go with the

131
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
presentation style of pdf for those of

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
you who prefer to see it in a single

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
sheet

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
there's also a version in the meeting

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
materials in that format if you'd prefer

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
it

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
so the first part of the chart reads

138
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
media over quick will develop a simple

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
low latency media delivery solution for

140
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
ingest and distribution

141
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
this solution may address use cases

142
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
including live streaming gaming and

143
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,280
media conferencing and will scale

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,440
efficiently the solution will support

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,919
both web browsers and non-browser

146
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,039
endpoints

147
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,199
the work focuses on building protocol

148
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
mechanisms for publication of media and

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
means to identify and receive

150
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
the media

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,319
the media publication protocol will be a

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,080
push protocol for sending media

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
including audio video and timed metadata

154
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,639
such as closed captions and cue points

155
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,560
the common protocol for publishing media

156
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
over ingest and distribution will

157
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,639
support

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
one or more media formats an

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
interoperable way to request media and

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,919
encodings

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
rate adaptation strategies based on

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,479
changing codec rates changing chosen

163
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,720
media encoding qualities

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
cache friendly media mechanisms

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
the media to name and receive media will

166
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,160
enable requesting the server start

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
sending media related to a given point

168
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,120
in the stream

169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
selection of desired encoding choosing

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
language bitrate etc

171
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
media will be mapped onto underlying

172
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,280
quick mechanisms quick streams and or

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
quick datagrams and can be used over raw

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
quick or web transport

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
the proposed solution will provide

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
extensibility for supporting different

177
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
media formats and shall specify a

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,080
mandatory to implement media format to

179
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
ensure interoperability

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
support for multiple media types and

181
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
media encodings shall be proposed

182
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
the solution will specify a simple

183
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
method of authentication to access media

184
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
as well as a mechanism for carrying

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
information enabling additional

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
decryption of media payloads where

187
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
required

188
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
the working group will define moq such

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,800
that the media publication protocol can

190
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
leverage coordinating relays caches or

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
replication points wherever applicable

192
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
to improve the delivery performance

193
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
media will be encrypted possibly end and

194
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,160
encrypted for certain use cases

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
the keying mechanisms for media

196
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
confidentiality is however outside the

197
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
scope of this working group

198
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,639
even when media is end-to-end encrypted

199
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,879
the relays can access metadata needed

200
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
for caching such as time stamps making

201
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
media forwarding decisions such as drop

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
or delay under congestion and so on

203
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
this working group will not propose

204
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
changes to the underlying quick

205
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
transport but may propose requirements

206
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
for quick extensions to the quick

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,559
working group

208
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
this working group will not define

209
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
signaling mechanisms for discovery of

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
relay or media producers or consumers

211
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
this working group will coordinate with

212
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
a quick and web transport working groups

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,320
as needed it will liaise with mpeg-dash

214
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,279
forum and the w3c web transport as

215
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
appropriate

216
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
here are the milestones currently

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
proposed

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
working group adoption of protocol

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
specification for common media

220
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
publication protocol over quick working

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
group adoption of protocol specification

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
for datagram extension to media

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
publication protocol over quick

224
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
working group adoption of protocol

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
specification for media subscription

226
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
protocol over quick working group

227
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
adoption of architecture specification

228
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,320
for common media delivery protocol over

229
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,120
quick

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
working group adoption of use cases and

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
requirements document for media delivery

232
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
over quick

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
and a decision about whether to forward

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
to isg for publication to be made later

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
by working group consensus

236
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
each of which then

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,160
results in one being forwarded to the

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
iasg

239
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
so that is a quick run through the

240
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
charter you should also all have the

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,959
access to it and the meeting

242
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
materials if you wish to refer to it

243
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
directly

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
the cues are open for discussion please

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
remember to use the meet echo queue to

246
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
make sure that we have that correctly

247
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,239
all right first step is sanjay

248
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,079
hi this is sanjay mishra if

249
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
ted if you can go back to your opening

250
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,560
description of the charter

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
so the

252
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
second sentence here says

253
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
this solution may address use cases

254
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
my question is that shouldn't we be a

255
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,560
little bit more uh

256
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
clear about it that the intent is to

257
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
define use cases so should we say shall

258
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
or something more uh

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,959
persistent that you know we do plan to

260
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,719
do something here than just saying may

261
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
uh so there's a little bit of discussion

262
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
on the list and the reason uh that it's

263
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,959
uh worded this way at the moment is

264
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,000
because

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,920
uh it's may address use places including

266
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
and so the including may there may also

267
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
be use cases which are not included so

268
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
it's not more definite than that so if

269
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
we want to

270
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
make it more different we could update

271
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,519
this to say

272
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,440
i may address use

273
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,160
cases which shall include at least and

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
then include these

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
and then leave open what what else is

276
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,279
included would you prefer that wording

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
sorry i had walked away from the mic yes

278
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
i think that makes sense to me

279
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,000
okay can i ask you to open a pr or would

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
you like one of us to do it

281
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,079
i can do it

282
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,040
okay

283
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,680
thank you thank you

284
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
uh victor

285
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
so one thing i just realized is uh

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,639
in uh on the second slide uh

287
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,360
in common in the charter

288
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
uh we say for push protocol a way to

289
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
request media but request is

290
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,920
fundamentally not a push operation it's

291
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,639
kind of a pull operation so we might

292
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
want to be more vague about

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
what specifically

294
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
we want the push protocol to do in terms

295
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
of media form of negotiation

296
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,079
because it

297
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
as it stands right now it makes it

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,399
sounds like

299
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,120
even even close oh okay

300
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
remember that crosstalk is not audible

301
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,519
to the hybrid user so please repeat

302
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
anything that said directly there okay

303
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,560
uh is this better oh

304
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,360
so

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,079
the

306
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,160
uh regarding on the second slide there

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
is a part where we say request encode

308
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,800
media form as an encoding

309
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,000
uh but request is a pull operation which

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
is probably

311
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,399
uh more complicated than something we

312
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,680
want in a baseline push protocol because

313
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,839
often for push cases i just have one

314
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
format and i want to peer know what that

315
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,399
format is but i might not necessarily

316
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
want to request or negotiate it

317
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
so i think we need to make the wording

318
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,560
there

319
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
uh more uh

320
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
generic and

321
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,079
lower the requirements for the push

322
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,880
protocol and

323
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
or move parts of it to the

324
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,040
mechanism to name and receive media

325
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,880
so it sounds like push is making some

326
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
implications for you um and i guess as

327
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
the other folks come to the mic line

328
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
please consider whether there's a

329
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
different phrase than push that captures

330
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,279
what you believe that protocol

331
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
is likely to do because i i do agree

332
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
that there are some aspects of what's

333
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,720
described here

334
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
uh that are not purely push protocol but

335
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,399
i think are

336
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
intended to

337
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,279
you know

338
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,000
cause a push to begin so to speak and uh

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
we may need a different phrase for that

340
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
can i clarify uh

341
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
sorry uh i don't have objection to push

342
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
i think push is

343
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,519
very good i it's more as a connotation

344
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
to requests that

345
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,839
worry me

346
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
okay thanks julius

347
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
uh hello uh

348
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
so uh i think the intent here is to

349
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,440
allow also to negotiate parameters such

350
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,360
as svc or simulcast

351
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,160
but

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,399
uh i'm wondering whether we should be

353
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
explicit about it

354
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
i mean is the charter currently written

355
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
in such a way that people in the future

356
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,199
might claim that similar negotiating the

357
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,680
simulcast structure or negotiating svc

358
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
is out of scope

359
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
if people think that it is clear enough

360
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
that i'm fine with that

361
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,680
but i'm wondering whether that should be

362
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,399
made explicit

363
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
is that a question for someone in

364
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
particular or to the room

365
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
no no it is a comment about the current

366
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
charter okay

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
saying that i'm a little bit worried

368
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,959
whether

369
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,399
this is too restrictive or not

370
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,240
okay uh colin

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
uh colin johnson cisco uh the i think

372
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
when we talk about the the push like one

373
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
of the use cases like on the ingest you

374
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,519
might only have one thing to push but on

375
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
the distribution sort of approach like

376
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,000
one of our very one of our key use cases

377
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
is be able to request bit streams at

378
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
different uh

379
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
you know bit rates effectively at some

380
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
level right that's a key fundamental

381
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
part of this stuff

382
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
so i think the fact that though it is a

383
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
push protocol does not mean there's no

384
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
information flowing in the opposite

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
direction telling something what to push

386
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,160
so i think we just need to phrase this

387
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,120
in a way of you know there's some

388
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
information you know you you could say

389
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
what you want pushed in some sort of way

390
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,639
right and we've sort of described in the

391
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,800
outline here so i just i i don't think

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
people can take push protocol to mean

393
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
that information only goes one direction

394
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
it's not like our congestion our

395
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
security nothing would work with that

396
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,000
it's it it is uh there's a certain

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,279
information you can indicate about

398
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,839
what's what's being pushed uh to you and

399
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,279
sometimes there's only one thing to push

400
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
that's fine but other times there might

401
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
be a little bit of information that's

402
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
like even the sort of correlating uri

403
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
name of what which one of many streams a

404
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
server might support that it needs to

405
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,199
push to you thanks so i i think the text

406
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
in the charter is pretty good right now

407
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,319
i just think that we

408
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
we need to understand it to mean it in

409
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,879
that context

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
kyle

411
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,359
kyle rose akamai is this thing on

412
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,280
um so i note that the charter says um or

413
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,520
so far the draft charter says

414
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
uh the solution may address use cases

415
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,039
including live streaming gaming and

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,960
media conferencing

417
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
these are very different use cases

418
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
it really feels like i mean so for

419
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
instance um gaming

420
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
is uh is something that wants to be low

421
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
latency in one direction but doesn't

422
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
require interactivity media conferencing

423
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
is requires interactivity low latency

424
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
interactivity in both directions

425
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,760
live streaming can have

426
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
an arbitrarily high hand wave latency

427
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
depending on what's

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
what is uh acceptable to the

429
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
to both customers and you know viewers

430
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
and and content providers

431
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
it seems like one of the reasons why the

432
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,880
quick working group was

433
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
successful is

434
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
they picked a particular use case which

435
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
was http and implemented that

436
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,240
and that seems like a better approach is

437
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
like pick a single use case

438
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
and have other people in the room with

439
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
future use cases that you know will

440
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
basically say okay

441
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
uh let's let's make sure that whatever

442
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
we do here doesn't preclude these future

443
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
use cases but just kind of scale it back

444
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,200
a little bit rather than trying to boil

445
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,960
the ocean that's my two cents

446
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,720
thanks uh luke

447
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
hi uh going back to push versus pool

448
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,640
really quickly um

449
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,840
i don't think the charter needs to

450
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
specify push i think it's um if anything

451
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
it's a technical detail we're trying to

452
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,840
reduce latency we're trying to make it

453
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,799
simpler

454
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
but end of the day

455
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
two the media endpoints need to

456
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
coordinate

457
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,559
um you could feasibly have you know the

458
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
other end request uh

459
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
uh and i think that there's a whole lot

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
of uh room there and there's gonna be

461
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
debate in the future if you say push

462
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,919
protocol like is this technically a push

463
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,320
protocol but i said i want something

464
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
so i would just remove that from the

465
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
charter remove push versus pull just

466
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,120
it's a protocol for sending media it

467
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,879
doesn't matter who asks for the data

468
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,520
thanks victor hello i have one

469
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
clarification question so i am emil from

470
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,039
orwenj

471
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
oh just next time please remember to uh

472
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
do hear me yes but just next time

473
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
remember to join the queue

474
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
okay

475
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,520
can you show the second slide

476
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
yeah

477
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,760
my name is emil i work for orange

478
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
and

479
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
you say it's a common protocol for

480
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
publishing over ingest on distribution

481
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
does it mean that

482
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
it will be the same protocol for

483
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
for ingesting the content and for

484
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,799
distributing the content

485
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,240
i think that's the intention yes it's a

486
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
requirement

487
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,480
okay good

488
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
thanks victor

489
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
hello again uh so to elaborate on push

490
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
versus pull uh

491
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
i think the fundamental

492
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,559
distinction i'm trying to make here

493
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,960
is that there is a part of the protocol

494
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
that's responsible for

495
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
getting media from one point to another

496
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,480
and like

497
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
specifying how it's actually transferred

498
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
and then there is all of the

499
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,280
negotiation and side channel

500
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
and to some extent

501
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,000
the reason we're trying to kind of

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
draw the line between different drafts

503
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,120
is that

504
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
the part where you send media and the

505
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,559
exact method is approach it should be

506
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
common regardless of what you're doing

507
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
but depending on your specific use case

508
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
uh the actual

509
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,880
things you will negotiate etc will be

510
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
different

511
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
so for instance requesting media

512
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
makes sense in if in case you're

513
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,679
uh

514
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
okay so those are details but the point

515
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
i'm trying to make is the part we're

516
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,559
trying to say i want to separate is

517
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
the part where the media gets

518
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,919
transferred versus

519
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,120
any

520
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,158
control information

521
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
thanks no

522
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
mozzanaty cisco um i think i agree with

523
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,679
luke that the push versus pull

524
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,919
is probably you know not something that

525
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
needs to be flushed out in the charter

526
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
it's uh i don't think it's just a nuance

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,799
i think it is going to be a lot more

528
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
technical detail and i think people have

529
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,400
different ideas in the room and like

530
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,559
what victor calls push i don't think

531
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,520
some others would call push um i think

532
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,960
it's correct to have

533
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,600
uh the text about requesting receivers

534
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
requesting uh in the charter i think

535
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
that that makes sense i don't think we

536
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
should have something that says you know

537
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,799
uh uh

538
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,320
publishers push

539
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
i think that that goes too far and we

540
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,960
need to

541
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
uh work in the you know work the details

542
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,159
of what does it actually mean to to

543
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,799
publish is it a request from the server

544
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
to tell you to go ahead you know you can

545
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,159
start publishing and do we want a

546
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
symmetric protocol where it's the same

547
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
whether you're publishing or subscribing

548
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
it's a request and a response and the

549
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,440
response can be not immediate or

550
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,919
synchronous but long-lived it could it

551
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,640
could send you know objects over seconds

552
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,120
uh in response to that request i think

553
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,559
those details need to be flushed out in

554
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
documents and not in the in the charter

555
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
and one final point on what julius

556
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
mentioned for

557
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,559
svc and various encodings i think the

558
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
current text already captures the rated

559
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
adaptation strategies with different

560
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
codecs codec rates

561
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
and qualities and encodings i think that

562
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,039
already captures

563
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,400
um all that we want for the different

564
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,919
media formats that that people are

565
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,320
interested in

566
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,559
thank you bernard

567
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,640
uh yeah i support kyle's comment that

568
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
this is boiling the ocean uh the use

569
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,559
cases that are described are extremely

570
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,679
different

571
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
um and i think

572
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
my personal view is that the focus here

573
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
should be on live streaming

574
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,240
uh which in particular you know needs to

575
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,159
low latency but also can benefit from

576
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,360
caching

577
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,520
um and the gaming some of the gaming use

578
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
cases are extremely different they don't

579
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
use caching

580
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,480
um and and uh conferencing is another

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
whole whole problem of real-time

582
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,440
conferencing

583
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,120
um so i think i think it needs more

584
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
focus there's enough work in here for

585
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,399
like three or four working groups

586
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
thank you uh stefan

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
so two things uh first i support what

588
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
kyle and bernard said

589
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,480
um i've said that before

590
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,720
uh the second thing is i'm i'm worried

591
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,919
about uh specifying a mandatory

592
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,840
media format

593
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
given the current political climate i

594
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,720
mean realistically the choice nowadays

595
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,960
is between the vp9 av1 world and the hvc

596
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,960
vvc world for the video stuff um

597
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,520
that's scary right now uh as those of us

598
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,159
who listen in what's going on in dbp and

599
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,919
w3c and places like that

600
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,039
have already experienced there are

601
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,480
entirely too many lawyers involved i

602
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,720
would suggest to remove this

603
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
i would

604
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,679
i know that interoperability is a high

605
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,080
goal blah blah blah but i would not go

606
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,918
it's way too painful thank you

607
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,880
yeah we can hear you speak up just a bit

608
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
okay cool um uh i i kind of wanted to

609
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
touch a bit upon the use cases and uh

610
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
and you know should we cover

611
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,640
all this nameless questions or not so

612
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
one of the main trends i see why mock

613
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,279
was formed um even when we had something

614
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,760
like a dash or um

615
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,640
hls uh was was a non-web bodies on one

616
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
side was that some of the use cases that

617
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,559
we are seeing there's a trend where uh

618
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
use cases that involve uh streaming and

619
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
also the interactivity

620
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
they're combining and and we don't have

621
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
a solution to

622
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,159
support anything like that today um

623
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
either one is very complicated or

624
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,559
otherwise it's very latency driven

625
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,480
cannot meet the interactive requirements

626
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
and that's true

627
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
can you slow down just a little bit i'm

628
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,159
having a hard time getting your words

629
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
okay so i'll i'll try uh second

630
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,320
technique so uh the point i was trying

631
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
to say is that there's a lot of new use

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
cases that's coming where uh

633
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,320
the streaming world is trying to move

634
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,919
towards bringing in interactivity

635
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,200
aspects

636
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
and and uh interactive world is trying

637
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,679
to bring you to the scaling aspects uh

638
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,840
and and that's driving the mock work

639
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
that's that's what way where i

640
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
felt that the today's solutions either

641
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,200
the webrtc being complex on one side or

642
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,640
the the existing low latency dash or

643
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,159
or the other speaking solutions they are

644
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,919
not able to meet the interactivity

645
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,240
requirements and most of the use cases

646
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
that have been written there they have a

647
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,279
common theme of having uh low latency

648
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,159
and interactivity and scale uh

649
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
in common in there can all does all

650
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
these use cases need caching may not uh

651
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
but most of them do need to do benefit

652
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
from having cash in so

653
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,679
even though i do feel like it might be

654
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,760
boiling the ocean but they are only

655
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
these things are need to be solved for

656
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
today's and tomorrow's use cases and

657
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,159
hence a new working group and mock i

658
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,320
think would be a good place for that and

659
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,159
on the push versus school

660
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,159
it might be technical at this point in

661
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,240
time but i i tend to agree with what

662
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,320
victor was uh pointing out saying that

663
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
regardless of how the media is asked how

664
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
the media is delivered should be common

665
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
across both ingest and distribution side

666
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
uh if you want to use the word push or

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
pull or a different terminology that's

668
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
totally fine but we need to capture that

669
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
aspect somewhere in the chapter thank

670
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,720
you

671
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,120
okay so uh ellen and i have uh discussed

672
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
this a little bit in a side channel and

673
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,960
it seems like the discussion of whether

674
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,840
the

675
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,919
phrase push should be there

676
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
is kind of rat holing a little bit um

677
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,559
and so uh i think what we'd like to say

678
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,760
as chairs

679
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
is that we accept that this is a design

680
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,440
decision to be made by the working group

681
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,720
and that the

682
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,200
exact phrasing uh to describe the

683
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
protocol could be

684
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,679
uh filigreed or something very different

685
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
than push but we're going to set that

686
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,080
aside uh functionally accept the pr that

687
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
was just filed to remove the push from

688
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,919
the charter

689
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,840
and and move on to the more substantive

690
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,279
discussions because that seems to be a

691
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,760
bit of a rat hole uh it doesn't seem to

692
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
be a bit of a rat hole um to talk about

693
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
uh how many

694
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,120
use cases we're going to support and so

695
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,080
i think

696
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
um one of the things in the current

697
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,080
charter is an attempt to identify

698
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
uh the high

699
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
uh the high value ones that are

700
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,559
currently kind of active um in

701
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
uh

702
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,440
in

703
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
in the industry at the moment um but

704
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,159
leave the

705
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,120
um

706
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,159
the

707
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,480
will support there to um

708
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
uh to be a little bit uh vaguer than

709
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
that and so i think it would be very

710
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
useful if folks could focus on whether

711
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
picking one of these

712
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
wouldn't have bad long-term consequences

713
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,880
because i think in the in the chat it's

714
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
been raised by a couple of people

715
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,080
that

716
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
it might be restrictive and then picking

717
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
two might be better than one picking

718
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
three might be better than two

719
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
so i think some additional discussion on

720
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,520
that is probably needed

721
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,240
all right thanks uh let's see uh sanjay

722
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
hi uh this is sanjay mishra from verizon

723
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
um i also have questions as i was

724
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,640
reading the charter i also struggled

725
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,600
with the

726
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
with the use cases

727
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
um that are so divergent in nature each

728
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,480
of those so i think i agree that it

729
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
makes sense to have a charter that

730
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,120
basically scopes out all the relevant

731
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
work that needs to be done but i think

732
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,039
it might be helpful

733
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,240
once if the working group is formed that

734
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
some discussion happens that sort of

735
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,399
says you know what is the priority can

736
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,799
we can we take a live streaming use case

737
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,720
as the first example of that working

738
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,520
group will take on or versus you know

739
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,919
media conferencing or live streaming or

740
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,679
live gaming because each of these are

741
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
very different use cases and have their

742
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,679
own different requirements in terms of

743
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
what the latency really means and and so

744
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,960
so forth so i think it's probably worth

745
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,039
looking at it that

746
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,240
there's some prioritization made and

747
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,760
working group as a whole decides that

748
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
this is the use case we want to work

749
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,279
unless there are enough people

750
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
that will work independently on each of

751
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,720
these use cases you know which is really

752
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,360
really very wide so i think it may be

753
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,000
better to have have one focus and then

754
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
get that out of the way and then take

755
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
the next use case and so on

756
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,200
thanks

757
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
thank you uh york

758
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,039
yeah thanks i i just wanted to

759
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,799
second the point that stefan made i

760
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,320
personally i don't care too much about

761
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,440
can you get a little bit closer to the

762
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,679
mic please personally i wanted to second

763
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,440
the point that stefan made personally i

764
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
don't care too much about media encoding

765
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,159
but it seems to be hard to pick to agree

766
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,080
on a single one we had had issues with

767
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,120
that before and especially given the zoo

768
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,960
of use cases that we currently have it

769
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
may not be even possible to pick

770
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
something sensible that would make i

771
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
would make it across all these cases

772
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,480
beyond the political stuff that stefan

773
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,880
pointed out

774
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
thanks

775
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
spencer

776
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,840
okay spencer dawkins um i've got two

777
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
things but let me just focus on the one

778
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,960
we're talking about for now

779
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,559
the

780
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
discussion about the use cases

781
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
i agree with but i wanted to go a little

782
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,439
bit further on that

783
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,640
one of the questions i've asked on the

784
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
mailing list was about

785
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
how we would you know whether there's a

786
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,159
relationship between this and work in

787
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,720
avt core

788
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,880
and the answer on the mailing list was

789
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
there's not a relationship with abt core

790
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,840
especially if we're getting down to the

791
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,919
interactive

792
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
uh use cases

793
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,159
um

794
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
i'm not sure i'm not sure if

795
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
i'm not sure if i agree with that you

796
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
know i mean i'm just mostly asking if

797
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,399
other people

798
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
uh are buying that

799
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,720
but that that has a lot to like i say it

800
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
has a lot to do with the use cases that

801
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
are in scope

802
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,200
if the use cases that are in scope are

803
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,279
live

804
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,399
live media use cases

805
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,120
i i think it is i think it is clear that

806
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
there's not a relationship or not a

807
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,279
close relationship

808
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
but i think that if mock is also

809
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,039
targeting

810
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,240
interactive

811
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,200
applica use cases it's a lot harder to

812
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
say that there's not one

813
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,600
um

814
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,120
do

815
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
should i

816
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
there's people there's people in line

817
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,080
behind me so i will stop there

818
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,919
say what you want what

819
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,840
what should we change

820
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,639
make a suggestion

821
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,440
i i'm informed by cullen behind me that

822
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
i have not said anything yet so uh i

823
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
will i will i will take a shot at uh

824
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,360
saying something which is basically uh

825
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,559
the

826
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,760
definition

827
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,159
of the uh of like i say the definition

828
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
of the use cases

829
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,679
can or could point to

830
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,559
live media as defined in the mock

831
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,640
requirements draft which is an

832
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,679
individual draft and has no standing but

833
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,519
i'm saying it does have a definition for

834
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,720
that in there

835
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,320
that could be used to distinguish

836
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,720
the use cases that are in scope and that

837
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
i'm not telling you that's the right

838
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,000
answer i'm telling you

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
that that would be a concrete suggestion

840
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,760
that makes sense

841
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
that was concrete thanks vince cullen

842
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,240
jennings um i i sort of want to address

843
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,919
this this use case thing i think that

844
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
the the people that have been working on

845
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,760
this for the past you know a couple

846
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
years and six months and having lots of

847
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
conversations on this

848
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,480
you know we sort of tried to think about

849
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,559
do we just want the way we split up the

850
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,159
different ways of splitting apart the

851
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,519
work we're going to do do we just do

852
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,360
ingress or do we just do distribution or

853
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,519
do we do both do both

854
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,640
and then the thing is there's huge

855
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
efficiency gains of what you want to do

856
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,399
and so you can look at that list of

857
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,080
things and go oh wow that's a wide list

858
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
of use cases they're very different but

859
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,320
what we do at ietf is trying to create a

860
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
single generic tool that's pretty simple

861
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,919
and i'll talk about what the tool is

862
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,519
that this is creating here that covers

863
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,679
multiple things i mean http you can use

864
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,199
it for banking websites you can use it

865
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,879
for news websites you can use it for

866
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,679
gaming i mean you can even send you know

867
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,839
machine calls over it it's a generic

868
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,000
tool so the tool that we're trying to

869
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
create here is a low latency highly

870
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,879
scalable video system

871
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,760
and

872
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,159
uh we do both ingress and distribution

873
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
because if you don't do both you end up

874
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
with mapping problems between the two so

875
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,000
that's the real incentive there and

876
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,280
we're not talking about creating

877
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,639
different tools for all of those use

878
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,480
cases we're talking about creating one

879
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,119
tool that sort of will meet to varying

880
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,119
degrees each one of those use cases and

881
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,719
that tool is a

882
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,399
low latency

883
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,079
highly uh scalable simple sort of uh

884
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,440
video

885
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
up and down system

886
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,399
and i i don't think there's you know if

887
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,119
you say oh we're only going to deal with

888
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,560
um

889
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
you know one of those use cases you end

890
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,079
up with there's already better solutions

891
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,359
in the marketplace for it you could use

892
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,079
webrtc you could go use hls dash the

893
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,440
thing is when you want to combine these

894
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
things together and have a unified tool

895
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
and way of doing it

896
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,400
that's when you get to this work making

897
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
sense so i don't really care if people

898
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,079
remove some of those use cases or

899
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,440
whatever that's not we can remove all

900
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,280
the use cases and mention of them from

901
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,040
the charter but the important thing to

902
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,880
me is the tool we're creating is going

903
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,720
to end up being useful for all of those

904
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
use cases no matter what we say in this

905
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
right like that's that's the tool we

906
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,280
want to create here so it's really

907
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,560
important to me

908
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,400
that we keep the scope of the work in

909
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,560
the in the charter that you know as it

910
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,079
is that we don't just try and great

911
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,920
greatly scope it down because it has no

912
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,599
value if you take a smaller piece than

913
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,880
this and people just the people doing

914
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
the work just aren't going to be willing

915
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
to work on it is not it's not a huge

916
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,760
value thing um and we need it to be

917
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,680
common we need to meet a bunch of these

918
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
use cases so that we can get the synergy

919
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
of the different groups of people that

920
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,560
all need to work on this to bring

921
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
something together so i think it really

922
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,760
needs to proceed as it is thanks

923
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,640
thank you carol

924
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,280
hey can you hear me

925
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,400
yes

926
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
awesome um i came to say almost the same

927
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
thing that colin said so

928
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
i in terms of use cases

929
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,720
i think if we go with just like a live

930
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,320
streaming use case right so it's very

931
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,839
easy to

932
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,000
there's already like dash hls all these

933
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,400
different solutions that um sort of

934
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,800
works right so but

935
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
um i think it's important to

936
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,280
build a solution that works for

937
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,119
different use cases and we already see

938
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,040
the requirements even within live

939
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,000
streaming there are use cases where

940
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,520
latency of 10 seconds is fine uh but

941
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
there are requirements where latency of

942
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,359
subsequent is needed for interactivity

943
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,800
right so and like where do you draw the

944
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
line where it's like yeah like at this

945
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
latency you need a different protocol

946
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,720
and it's also very difficult

947
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,760
to

948
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
build deploy and run the services if for

949
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
every single like for for very similar

950
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,040
use cases you have to

951
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,560
essentially use different protocols with

952
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
different infrastructure so having

953
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,359
something

954
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,400
um that works uh for

955
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,280
a variety of cases is uh would be very

956
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
very beneficial and i understand there's

957
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
definitely it's hard problem

958
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,599
uh hopefully we can at least try to

959
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,320
solve it um the second point i want to

960
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,119
like

961
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
related to charter

962
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,079
phrasing

963
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,640
i um you know i think in the beginning

964
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
of the charter there is a

965
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
phrase about interval way to request

966
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,640
median encodings

967
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,960
i have slight problem with wording

968
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,040
requests because i think it sort of

969
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
implies that someone is asked like that

970
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,680
someone has to ask uh about the

971
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,079
uh the quality the encodings that being

972
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
sent but i think it's

973
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
important to support the cases where

974
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
like for example whoever is sending

975
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
media can decide what the quality to

976
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
send so like basically what i'm talking

977
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,920
about the server server server driven uh

978
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,760
decisions versus client driven decisions

979
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,240
and we need to support both

980
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,479
thank you

981
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,800
thanks uh jonathan hi jonathan rosenberg

982
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,359
five nine uh two comments first uh

983
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,920
wanted to respond to stefan wenger and

984
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,040
disagree

985
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,440
uh i do think we should

986
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
make sure we produce something that has

987
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,000
a

988
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,640
minimum uh mandatory codex i think we

989
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,920
are at the point now on the internet

990
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,079
where we can do that largely due to the

991
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,560
very painful work that happened before

992
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,240
that many of us went through

993
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,880
uh opus and av1 being the result um so

994
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,800
that's comment number one comment number

995
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
two on the wording on the charter um one

996
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,839
thought uh or a possible suggestion

997
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,119
is to think of this as a published

998
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
subscribe system because the where the

999
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,880
publishing effectively

1000
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
takes care of the push and subscribers

1001
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
on the receive side i think if you frame

1002
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,480
it as publish subscribe

1003
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
a lot of the problems that we need to

1004
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
address with the protocol become very

1005
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,079
clear

1006
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,920
naming and identification

1007
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
uh how you create and establish

1008
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,839
subscriptions how you choose amongst

1009
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,079
formats uh or all the things buffering

1010
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,160
and re-transmission caching from the

1011
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,440
publisher the subscriber all become

1012
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,839
fairly clear and understood concepts so

1013
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,520
i apologize i

1014
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,040
did read the docs but have not followed

1015
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,480
the list so recently so that may have

1016
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
been discussed but that's one suggestion

1017
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,240
thanks

1018
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,520
uh philip philhan baker yeah a couple of

1019
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
uh charter tweets could you go to slide

1020
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,359
number three

1021
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,839
well the charter

1022
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,160
three uh where it says um

1023
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
shall specify

1024
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,480
mandarin media format

1025
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
i'd like to make that a may and the

1026
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,599
reason for that is

1027
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,880
interoperability is a property of

1028
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
systems

1029
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,640
and when i build systems i really do not

1030
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
care

1031
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,800
what the mandatory to implement of jose

1032
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,599
or pkcs7 or whatever i might be using is

1033
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,680
when i build the system that's the point

1034
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,760
at which i'm going to choose my

1035
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,680
mandatory to implement

1036
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
algorithms

1037
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
and unless you've got a key exchange

1038
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,440
you're not going to have interop anyway

1039
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,359
so i don't want to have that argument

1040
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,960
here but i'd like to defer it so that

1041
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
working group can have it so if we make

1042
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
that in may so that's the first

1043
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,720
uh tweak i'd like to make and then when

1044
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,560
we go to the uh

1045
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
where it mentions end to end encryption

1046
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,040
i don't know which slide that's on i'm

1047
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,319
afraid i'd like to make that ends

1048
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,040
plural to ends

1049
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,920
and i know that we're very big on end to

1050
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
end

1051
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,599
that doesn't work in security

1052
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,560
because it's not just alice and bob

1053
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,119
and there's mention of these relay

1054
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,319
servers

1055
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,440
getting unencrypted metadata

1056
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,760
i want to be able to encrypt it

1057
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
and i want to have that in the first

1058
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
version of the spec

1059
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,680
rather than coming back for abyss

1060
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,599
or a new charter group

1061
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,720
just to be able to encrypt the metadata

1062
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,240
which should have been encrypted all

1063
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,400
along so i'd like to the charter to

1064
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,040
recognize that there's a plurality of

1065
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
ends and the encryption

1066
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,359
mechanism should allow for that

1067
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
thanks uh luke

1068
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,359
hi luke from twitch um so the first

1069
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,440
thing is media formats is a little vague

1070
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,800
at least in the media world i don't know

1071
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,560
if it's referring to a container or a

1072
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,160
codec

1073
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,440
definitely there should be a mandatory

1074
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,800
container but mandatory codec is kind of

1075
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,200
a deal breaker for distribution at least

1076
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
because a lot of the times we don't

1077
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
have control over whether it was encoded

1078
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
uh and you end up just having a lock-in

1079
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,280
you know you just force this one old

1080
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,359
codec to be used till the end of the day

1081
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,000
end of days

1082
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,319
the second thing is

1083
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,280
for use cases uh real time is hard uh

1084
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,599
and webrtc does a good job these days um

1085
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,480
it's it's complicated uh but also trying

1086
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
to tackle real time ourselves is

1087
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,319
complicated uh it might even be a bit of

1088
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,760
a scope creep

1089
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,720
um

1090
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
the real use case at least we see

1091
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,319
is

1092
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,560
interactive use cases where real time

1093
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,079
like conversational latency isn't

1094
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
required but you have the ability to

1095
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,800
buffer more if needed on a viewer by

1096
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
viewer basis

1097
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,160
so it's really hard to talk about this

1098
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
and put it in the charter but

1099
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,920
i would focus more just on like

1100
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,560
interactive is the word i think

1101
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,400
gaming and conferencing is just is kind

1102
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,000
of difficult honestly

1103
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
um

1104
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,200
but we definitely want to avoid the

1105
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
current situation where you have to pick

1106
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,359
a protocol per latency budget uh it's

1107
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,520
it's awful that one viewer has to get

1108
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,440
webrtc because they need real time and

1109
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,359
then somebody else needs to get hls

1110
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,560
because they have a poor network um so

1111
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
that's the big thing i think that we

1112
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,640
want to want to solve is try and

1113
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,880
spread out the use cases um and

1114
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,400
unfortunately that means tackling more

1115
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,720
areas

1116
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,078
okay thank you uh leslie

1117
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,119
hi uh leslie daigle and um for the

1118
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,560
purposes of this

1119
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,079
i'll just observe that i'm the co-chair

1120
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,000
of the mops working group

1121
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,960
um i don't have an issue with the text

1122
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
of the charter per se insofar as i think

1123
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,640
it does

1124
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
accurately and concretely describe the

1125
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,160
work that people have been working on

1126
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,520
this for a year

1127
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,880
would like to do

1128
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
and i suspect that work can be achieved

1129
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,000
however comma

1130
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,760
i'm a little worried particularly when

1131
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,520
colin says we build general protocols

1132
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,079
uh for multiplicity of use cases and

1133
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,359
purposes

1134
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,280
that the people who have been working on

1135
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,119
it for the last year aren't really the

1136
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,400
whole of the universe of people who are

1137
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,920
delivering video over ip

1138
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,119
i think there are some pretty

1139
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,119
significant audiences not represented in

1140
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,240
the room

1141
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,599
and that's okay

1142
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,720
as long as you understand that and as

1143
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
long as we don't in a year's time or two

1144
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,359
years time say well now we have

1145
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,160
the ultimate media transport over quick

1146
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,000
and anybody who wants to do any delivery

1147
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,800
over

1148
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,240
over ip

1149
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,800
any video delivery over ip have to use

1150
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,560
this protocol even if it wasn't designed

1151
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,800
for your use cases

1152
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,839
the

1153
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,760
first first few lines of the charter of

1154
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,200
the mops working group

1155
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,040
internet wide and within domain ip

1156
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,200
delivered media is widespread leading to

1157
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,800
significant technology developments

1158
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,560
across industries

1159
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,319
not traditionally thought of as internet

1160
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,319
technology developers or operators as

1161
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,839
well as considerable quantities of

1162
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,280
traffic on local and transit networks

1163
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,960
so we spent a couple of years trying to

1164
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,119
attract some of those audiences into the

1165
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,319
itf

1166
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,560
and

1167
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,800
and

1168
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
i think that what we really need here is

1169
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
to make sure that mock doesn't continue

1170
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,400
forward

1171
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,440
ignorant of the existence of mops and uh

1172
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,640
and doing

1173
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,920
unlinked work so we're mops we're here

1174
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
to help

1175
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
let me just maybe pause and ask i i see

1176
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,280
there are a lot of people in this room

1177
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,200
and online so and

1178
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,800
but i don't know who shows up to mop so

1179
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,079
do you feel like that some at least the

1180
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,839
mops people are here are you here there

1181
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,440
are certainly some mops people here and

1182
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,280
that's a good thing tm

1183
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,880
uh however comma again damn commas um

1184
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
however we're we're actually trying to

1185
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
draw more people from the sva cta other

1186
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,680
organizations into the ietf in general

1187
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,000
so you know we can help be a conduit if

1188
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,960
you will

1189
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,800
but just don't don't suffer from the

1190
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,040
closed world assumption and think that

1191
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,280
that everything that

1192
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
all necessary opinions have been

1193
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,480
represented

1194
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,200
thanks uh leslie could you add a pr to

1195
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,800
add mop to the list that the working

1196
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,160
group will will coordinate with

1197
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,200
i see a thumbs up

1198
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,000
i think okay okay uh magnus yeah magnus

1199
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
wesley and erickson i want to talk about

1200
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,880
the media format i've probably

1201
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,960
partly blamed for some of this

1202
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,680
formulation because i think at

1203
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,760
fostered a view in some discussions with

1204
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,119
the proponents here at last my thing

1205
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,520
and my intention was really enough from

1206
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,480
my perspective it is we're talking about

1207
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,880
isobase media files cms or things like

1208
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,800
that or potentially

1209
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,359
are you using rtp payloads in general

1210
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,359
with some metadata around this to make

1211
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,040
it work

1212
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,160
but i

1213
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
kind of see that

1214
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,839
probably should soften the welding here

1215
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,280
about

1216
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,599
because it does depend on the usage

1217
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,599
where you deploy it etc and and there

1218
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,520
are a few different cases here which

1219
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,839
might have different choices on how they

1220
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,280
want to use it so

1221
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,200
but it's definitely i mean the general

1222
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,119
aspect of you need to take the media

1223
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,680
formulas into account this work is clear

1224
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,480
and i think it's crucial to ensure that

1225
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
multiple can be supported

1226
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,839
okay thanks occur

1227
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
uh a few points um

1228
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,240
uh i agree with luke that it's important

1229
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,160
to specify

1230
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
whether this is really for you know

1231
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,760
this is for video conferencing type

1232
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,960
applications or for streaming

1233
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,200
applications they are different um

1234
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,480
and i understand jdr's point that they

1235
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,839
kind of trade in each other but like

1236
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,160
they're different um so knowing what

1237
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,880
we're targeting is important um i'm i

1238
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,000
went through the text on this about

1239
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,280
encryption and i find it extraordinarily

1240
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,319
puzzling

1241
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,119
um

1242
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,880
so first of all quick is always

1243
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
encrypted and quick has his own king

1244
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,240
king exchange so i don't understand like

1245
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,599
what any of this text really means it

1246
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,559
appears to be something about an

1247
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,520
encryption on top of quick um but

1248
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
um it makes some major revisions or

1249
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,880
actually sell something that like like

1250
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,160
people can understand

1251
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,440
um

1252
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,599
so um i also understand really what a

1253
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,720
simple method of authentication to

1254
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,640
access media is or for enabling

1255
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
additional descriptions so

1256
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,240
um

1257
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,839
perhaps someone can fix that stuff but

1258
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,280
um i think the charter needs to be i'm

1259
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
and maybe it's all and i'm i'm not

1260
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,559
saying that like structurally what he's

1261
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,520
being supposed to do is fine because i

1262
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,559
don't understand it but i'm saying that

1263
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,640
i don't understand it that's problematic

1264
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,520
um

1265
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,960
and finally um

1266
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,559
please do not write ends to ends nobody

1267
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,200
knows what that means

1268
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,480
uh okay thanks omer

1269
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,559
hello omar shapiro apple now apple

1270
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,599
uh

1271
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,480
i'm a little bit confused with the

1272
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,800
with the

1273
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,760
uh cash friendly

1274
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,119
and also working on a raw quick

1275
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,520
um

1276
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,520
or web transport because uh it uh

1277
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,640
it appears to me that uh large-scale

1278
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,400
caching implies the use of http

1279
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,040
so uh

1280
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
what i'm trying to say is that

1281
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,559
this charter seems like a super set of a

1282
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,760
few uh things that may not necessarily

1283
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,400
work all the time together and maybe

1284
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
it's worth clarifying the intention is

1285
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,880
this the case of

1286
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,079
working group that will oversee several

1287
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,079
solutions that do not will not work

1288
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,800
together or is the intent to actually

1289
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,000
try to

1290
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,319
uh make uh

1291
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,800
make it possible to cache real quick

1292
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,079
uh so this is my comment

1293
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,079
it's going for clarification it's not a

1294
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
technical comment of hey this needs to

1295
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,880
be done just for clarification of intent

1296
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,800
okay i think if if you asked is the

1297
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,559
intention to cash raw quick i don't

1298
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,280
think that's necessarily the the goal

1299
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,880
but maybe somebody who's closer to

1300
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,720
cashing or has thought about the text

1301
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,119
about relays and caches and cache

1302
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,720
friendliness can talk about maybe what

1303
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,160
that means a little bit more and how it

1304
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
relates to http

1305
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,440
colin

1306
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
telling jason let me just speak to uh

1307
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,000
both the previous two speakers uh

1308
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,440
questions there and see if i can answer

1309
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,920
them so i would start with the the

1310
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,800
security stuff um ecker point well taken

1311
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
that needs to be clarified in here but i

1312
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,240
think that the the proponents of this

1313
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,160
buff have a fairly clear understanding

1314
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,680
of what we mean and let me try and

1315
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,280
explain what that is and then we can try

1316
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
and work to get the charter to reflect

1317
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
that um

1318
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,920
certainly uh to put this in http terms

1319
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,680
yes all the connections are fully quick

1320
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,760
normal interpreted to that like just

1321
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,880
like http is encrypted to the cdn it's

1322
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,400
exactly the same

1323
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,240
but we don't want we want to have

1324
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,559
optionally the ability to inside of

1325
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,160
what's being tricked so that's hot by

1326
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,839
hop encryption between the client and

1327
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,920
the cdn the client and the server if

1328
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,319
there is no cdn and then from the server

1329
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,079
back down to the other receiving client

1330
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,480
is also that's all encrypted so what the

1331
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,800
end to end talking here is about is

1332
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,480
the data inside of that can also be

1333
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,319
optionally encrypted so some things

1334
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,800
wouldn't do it but the intention is to

1335
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,359
um use mls to kid

1336
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,400
and to be able to incu encrypt the

1337
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,559
blocks there and the metadata which is

1338
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,319
always a bad word there has to be some

1339
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,240
envelope data that is authenticated but

1340
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
not encrypted that tells you like time

1341
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,760
to live what the data is its destination

1342
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,319
who it's going to so i think that that's

1343
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,319
reasonably like me i'm not saying people

1344
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,599
agree on exactly details about the

1345
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,040
metadata or anything but the idea that

1346
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,119
we would optionally be able to take the

1347
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,280
media for some of the use cases and end

1348
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,960
and encrypt it i think it's really

1349
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
critical to some of the use cases

1350
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,800
um and the the way that that might be

1351
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
done might be completely different

1352
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,280
depending on whether you're talking

1353
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
about distributing you know drm

1354
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,400
encrypted video or anything else and

1355
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,559
it's out of scope of this working group

1356
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
other than to have a placeholder to be

1357
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,079
able to do that type of stuff and an

1358
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,920
architecture that enabled those types of

1359
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
use cases for for the people that wanted

1360
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
it so i hope that clarifies that one a

1361
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,760
little bit um

1362
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
on the caching

1363
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,160
um

1364
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,319
no the the intention is is not that you

1365
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,680
could use existing http zdns but that we

1366
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
uh there there are cdn providers they're

1367
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,960
aware of this work and have looked at

1368
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,319
the idea of

1369
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,079
uh building something that was

1370
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,680
compatible with a protocol that came out

1371
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,040
of this working group that was very

1372
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,400
media specific

1373
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,480
and very similar to what they already do

1374
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,920
with quick http cdns to be able to you

1375
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
know terminate the quick connection grab

1376
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,920
the data and cache it and do uh whatever

1377
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
was needed by the the work that was done

1378
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,359
out of this so it's

1379
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,960
well i think when we say cash friendly i

1380
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,319
mean that's completely vague term what

1381
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,839
does that even mean right it's hard but

1382
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,640
i think what people are imagining is

1383
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,559
a protocol that was designed from the

1384
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,960
beginning to enable people to build

1385
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,119
caches for deployments that want that

1386
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,480
type of thing there's certainly

1387
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,680
deployments that don't need that there's

1388
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,280
deployments that have completely their

1389
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,880
own caching network and everything and

1390
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,400
it's not defining how caches talk to

1391
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,240
each other it's just designing the

1392
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,880
protocol the work here such that

1393
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,400
uh caches

1394
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,720
can be used you can build a cache type

1395
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,920
environment if you want to i think

1396
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,760
that's what people what the proponents

1397
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,720
of this were largely thinking

1398
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,760
thank you spencer

1399
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,680
uh spencer dawkins i actually got up

1400
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
here to say something

1401
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
unrelated but i do want to

1402
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,680
agree with cullen there

1403
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,079
i think i think that's the i think

1404
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,480
that's the right attitude to have when

1405
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,880
we're talking about the charter

1406
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,520
and the charter is talk it says uh

1407
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,760
basically signaling for

1408
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,680
uh location of

1409
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,960
basically everything um is

1410
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,040
you know the working group would not

1411
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,599
not do define anything there

1412
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,920
i wonder if there are any constraints

1413
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,200
about

1414
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
how

1415
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,000
just

1416
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,319
any constraints on this protocol based

1417
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,119
on how people expect to be able to find

1418
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,720
sources and

1419
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,319
sinks and relays and stuff like that

1420
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,559
uh if people have something clearly in

1421
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,319
mind that that would you know that's

1422
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:37,839
that's cool but

1423
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,040
um

1424
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,559
i just you know if we're trying to talk

1425
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,079
about interoperability i'm a little

1426
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,720
concerned about that thank you spencer

1427
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,839
can you clarify what kinds of

1428
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,440
constraints you think might exist in

1429
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,720
people's minds

1430
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,000
i

1431
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,200
so base so basically basically as i read

1432
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,319
the charter

1433
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,000
if you if you wanted to have an

1434
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
interoperable solution

1435
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,359
using this

1436
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,359
uh there's no guidance

1437
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,040
from this charter about how we expect

1438
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,640
this protocol to be used at at a minimum

1439
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,880
and recognizing that you know anybody

1440
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,599
can do anything to locate anything in

1441
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,359
their special case but you know dude

1442
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,599
do do we want do we have at least one

1443
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,559
thing in mind that people could use

1444
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,280
to

1445
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,640
uh

1446
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,440
to

1447
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
locate the things that they need to

1448
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,839
locate and the reason i mention that

1449
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,400
probably is because i would expect the

1450
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,720
next conversation we have to be about

1451
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,200
privacy concerns for senders and

1452
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,480
receivers

1453
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,559
and you know it's like the best the best

1454
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,799
way for privacy concerns to be resolved

1455
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,799
is that senators and receivers can't

1456
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,559
find each other so

1457
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,839
you know that's probably not the goal

1458
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,720
okay thanks victor

1459
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,920
uh i was going to comment on the media

1460
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,799
format saying so as far as i remember

1461
00:54:58,799 --> 00:54:59,760
the

1462
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
this was originally

1463
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,400
phrased as media containers instead of

1464
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,720
media formats

1465
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,839
and then

1466
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,599
there were sufficiently many people

1467
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,599
upset with phrase containers that were

1468
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,920
placed into format

1469
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,119
regarding mandatory to implement

1470
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,720
i personally find that in practice the

1471
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,839
requirements to support a certain format

1472
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,240
or algorithm are

1473
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,680
in reality fairly toothless because

1474
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,079
if the parties support different format

1475
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:32,960
and

1476
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,119
the protocol supports it they will use a

1477
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,640
different format even if they don't

1478
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,720
support the mti format

1479
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,200
uh i think the message here is that the

1480
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,760
working group this should decide

1481
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,839
uh define one format we expect people to

1482
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,480
use

1483
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,559
not necessarily that everyone will use

1484
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,200
it or not necessarily that we expect

1485
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,680
people to even use it within five years

1486
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,799
after it's standardized

1487
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,480
okay thanks

1488
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,880
ecker

1489
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,720
so

1490
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,040
i think victor's point first um

1491
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,799
i did not expect there to be

1492
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,240
i'm trying to find this text now but i

1493
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,400
didn't read that text um as being

1494
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,160
mandatory to use format i

1495
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,599
interpreted management implement format

1496
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,280
just like vp8 and 264 for rtc um and i

1497
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,480
do think those are useful i think this

1498
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,920
great interoperability and i think we

1499
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,440
have um

1500
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,119
uh yeah empty military implements

1501
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,119
exactly what that's expected to say so i

1502
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,640
think this is very useful and i think

1503
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,720
it's a good idea um as for the

1504
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,000
encryption thank you colin that was very

1505
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,559
helpful um um i guess um two points

1506
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,160
about so um i'd be happy to work with

1507
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,839
you make the interpreter say that um two

1508
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,079
points i would be happier if it said it

1509
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,760
will always be ending encrypted um but

1510
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,280
maybe we can argue with that outside the

1511
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,640
charter um

1512
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,319
um second um i'm still a little unclear

1513
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,160
about and i obviously understand why

1514
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,160
you'd want to have um

1515
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,960
uh some metadata clear for you know

1516
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,559
for for thing really the way to do

1517
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,319
things we talked about that in srtp as

1518
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,119
well um but um authenticating that is

1519
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,480
actually quite a tricky problem so i

1520
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,359
think we may have understand what that

1521
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,880
means a little better to underst to be

1522
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,559
able to talk about that um it's like an

1523
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,799
srtp right the um

1524
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,160
the metadata is in the clear and it's

1525
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,480
authenticated and end but it can't be

1526
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,079
verified by people in other

1527
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,760
cryptographic keys and maybe that's what

1528
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,799
you want maybe it's not what you want

1529
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,920
but to be clear what we're trying to say

1530
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,880
thanks okay uh before we go on in the

1531
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,400
queue i want to

1532
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
to make a proposal here based on what

1533
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,280
we've heard so far uh what the charter

1534
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,680
draft text currently says shall specify

1535
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,520
a mandatory to implement media format to

1536
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,839
insurance interoperability i think we've

1537
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,760
had several people come up and say that

1538
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,880
the breadth of use cases makes that

1539
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,960
difficult to imagine actually working

1540
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,040
and what i propose is that we adjust

1541
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,319
this to say

1542
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,319
may specify a mandatory to implement

1543
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,280
media

1544
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,559
format for specific use cases to ensure

1545
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,200
interoperability for those use cases and

1546
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,520
i think what that gives us is to say if

1547
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,839
we see a use case where mandatory to

1548
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,760
implement is going to advance

1549
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,680
interoperability the working group can

1550
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,680
then go go forward and select one that's

1551
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,720
appropriate to that use case but it is

1552
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,119
not trying to say any particular media

1553
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,559
format is going to cover the full gamut

1554
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,720
so

1555
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,400
eric has said

1556
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,520
in chat that he would prefer the

1557
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,319
opposite an mti which can be overridden

1558
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,040
in specific use cases uh i think those

1559
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,040
are functionally the same uh so if you

1560
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,119
want to write a pr that says it that way

1561
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,040
and uh put it against the uh the um

1562
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,480
uh the charter that would be great

1563
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,839
okay thanks ted

1564
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,640
uh bernard

1565
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,599
yeah i i'd like to uh echo eckers

1566
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,880
earlier

1567
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,760
uh concerns about the words end-to-end

1568
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,839
encryption i think media encryption

1569
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,520
might make more sense

1570
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,119
because i don't think you're trying to

1571
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,640
say that you're going to encrypt all the

1572
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,319
way from the ingester

1573
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,559
uh to the end point that you would

1574
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,640
preclude transcoding

1575
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,640
so i think what you're really trying to

1576
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
do is encrypt the media

1577
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,079
um and

1578
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,319
depending on the scenario the ends may

1579
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,960
differ so

1580
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,960
okay thanks no

1581
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,000
uh mozinati cisco um if uh on the

1582
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
mandatory formats uh

1583
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,720
if we are if we are actually going to

1584
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,520
rehash the the kodak wars as uh

1585
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,040
as part of this work let's let's get an

1586
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,599
itf scheduled and hon lulu uh in the

1587
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,200
next year or two

1588
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,480
because that seems to be the only way to

1589
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,440
resolve it i'll have to do get ted to do

1590
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,359
one of his chants again um to get

1591
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,760
everybody calm and mellow um but on the

1592
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,760
mandatory formats i think it's important

1593
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,000
for people to realize that

1594
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,240
trying to make an exception for some use

1595
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,720
cases or

1596
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,960
or having text which says this is

1597
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,640
mandatory only in this use case i don't

1598
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,920
think anything in the protocol will

1599
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,440
actually ever be able to distinguish the

1600
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,400
use cases

1601
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,559
i'm not imagining any protocol

1602
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,200
bits or semantics that would actually

1603
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,119
tell someone this is live streaming or

1604
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,799
this is interactive or this is vaude

1605
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,319
so i'm kind of at a loss of how a

1606
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,559
publisher or subscriber would even know

1607
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,839
that this is going to be mandatory in

1608
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,440
this context or not so while i think

1609
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,280
it's well intentioned to limit the

1610
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,520
mandatory formats to some use case i

1611
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,200
don't think it's practically

1612
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,760
feasible to to do that

1613
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,400
and i think having a fallback that

1614
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,799
everybody always implements is becoming

1615
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,400
possibly less and less relevant over

1616
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,559
time especially if you try to use a

1617
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,200
fallback like webrtc did that's most

1618
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,440
likely to be ancient by the time that

1619
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,280
this protocol you know sees widespread

1620
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,160
adoption so if we had vp8 and h.264 in

1621
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,799
there i'd be very sad as those mandatory

1622
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,960
uh to implement formats so i don't think

1623
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,240
we should copy

1624
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,119
uh

1625
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,720
prior charters on on that um

1626
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,160
softening the language should just say

1627
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,400
may choose a mandatory format i think

1628
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,559
uh you know may get us further down the

1629
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:01,359
road

1630
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,960
um but i would not add the text that has

1631
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,480
suggested about specific use cases

1632
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,000
because i don't think that's going to be

1633
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,359
feasible to implement

1634
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,040
and then one point on the security is i

1635
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,960
i agree with ecker that reading the

1636
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,319
charter now

1637
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,119
um

1638
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,280
with uh fresh eyes

1639
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,119
it's very confusing and doesn't really

1640
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,079
convey

1641
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
what people that were working on this

1642
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,599
for a while have already had in the back

1643
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,160
of their heads that cohen suggested

1644
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,280
so really

1645
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,599
everything that is done by quick we

1646
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,599
should explicitly say in the charter

1647
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,319
that media will be encrypted per quick

1648
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,720
but there will optionally also be an

1649
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,559
end-to-end encryption and the protocol

1650
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,839
is not doing that i think it's clear to

1651
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,160
specify that we are not specifying any

1652
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,839
of the protocol not just the not just

1653
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,000
the keying but the actual use of those

1654
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,079
keys to encrypt media mock is not

1655
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,760
involved in any of that but what is

1656
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,920
important is to identify

1657
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,040
the protocol needs to be able to

1658
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,359
identify what is and encrypted and what

1659
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,359
the context is for that

1660
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,960
you know how do you know

1661
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,640
where do you get the drm keys or

1662
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,480
end-to-end keys for that i think that's

1663
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,079
important to specify that's really what

1664
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,400
the protocol is going to do is identify

1665
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,720
that some things are end and encrypted

1666
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,480
and what the context is for that

1667
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,240
encryption um and that there is a

1668
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,200
separate

1669
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,960
uh context for

1670
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
transport metadata

1671
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,240
that will

1672
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,480
the relays will have access to

1673
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,520
so i think those are the important

1674
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,599
things to get out in the charter

1675
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,039
thank you

1676
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,000
uh sanjay

1677
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,520
sanjay mishra here um i just wanted to

1678
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,520
respond back to uh what cullen was

1679
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,680
saying earlier on the use cases so i

1680
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,559
think

1681
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,960
i i don't think there's any um quants

1682
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,880
about use cases and and charter is the

1683
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
right place to have all those you to to

1684
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,760
be able to call out that uh moq mock

1685
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,839
will support these use cases i think the

1686
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,920
question is that each other use cases

1687
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,160
have to look differently for example

1688
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,880
that

1689
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,200
for live streaming really caching is not

1690
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,839
really something that you would do but

1691
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,599
you know maybe for vod that would make

1692
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,960
sense to do that

1693
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,000
um

1694
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,760
the the common denominator of course is

1695
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,359
that each of these for each of these

1696
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,359
applications will benefit with the low

1697
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,520
latency so low latency applies

1698
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,200
universally but there are other

1699
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,880
parameters you know for example caching

1700
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,400
will not apply to live streaming so i

1701
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,200
think that really the point is that

1702
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,799
these are all valid use cases that

1703
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,920
should be addressed and this is the

1704
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,000
right forum to do that it's just a

1705
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,039
question of you know how do you

1706
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,319
prioritize

1707
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,920
of those use cases that you would want

1708
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,400
to work on in a way that one is not

1709
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,319
stepping over the other in terms of

1710
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,680
conflicting with what you need to do

1711
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,440
with the live streaming versus

1712
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,359
video streaming case etc so that was the

1713
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:40,240
point

1714
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
thank you

1715
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,520
thanks

1716
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,839
luke

1717
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,520
hi luke from twitch again um so with

1718
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,599
mandatory formats um one of the things

1719
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,200
that comes up on the distribution side

1720
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,319
is caching

1721
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,839
if we have a thousand people watching a

1722
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,200
stream we

1723
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,400
we want them to all watch the same

1724
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,359
format

1725
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,200
uh we don't want to have this case where

1726
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,119
we have two people have

1727
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,200
this legacy format that the initial

1728
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,079
draft specified uh to not like invoke

1729
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,680
flame wars you could imagine if the

1730
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,960
draft said you must support gif um

1731
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,280
but in the future we're all using pngs

1732
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,280
you don't want one person using an old

1733
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,599
client to request a gif and forcing you

1734
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,520
in coding and

1735
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,200
spin up a new encoder and then force you

1736
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,119
to have a new cache so

1737
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,039
i don't at least for the broadcasting

1738
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,640
side you can make a case for mandatory

1739
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,200
formats you must support this codec but

1740
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,680
at least in the distribution side it's

1741
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,440
we want just one it's too expensive to

1742
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,200
support multiple ones uh in a lot of

1743
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
cases and we don't want to leave it up

1744
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,440
to the uh the viewer to decide if they

1745
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,440
want to make it expensive for us

1746
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,559
um so the mandatory for some use cases i

1747
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,160
think is just toothless like there's no

1748
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,240
point saying that uh if you can just opt

1749
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,920
out of it by saying i'm not that use

1750
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,720
case

1751
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,799
um so i would just leave it in the air

1752
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:55,920
like we have

1753
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,599
codex unfortunately people aren't going

1754
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,920
to come to a consensus anytime soon so

1755
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,119
we should not try to force that

1756
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,559
okay thanks steven

1757
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,960
so again on on the same topic

1758
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,230
um

1759
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,880
[Music]

1760
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,400
the use case

1761
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,720
is not necessary it does not necessarily

1762
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,799
only have a technical dimension

1763
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,480
so for example

1764
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,720
broadcast distribution

1765
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,839
in china where my employer sits

1766
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,760
uh is when it comes to codex election

1767
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,720
fundamentally diff different from

1768
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,480
broadcast distribution in the us as an

1769
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,640
example right and

1770
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,680
so

1771
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,280
trying

1772
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,640
to

1773
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,359
mandate a codec that

1774
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,680
folks over say in china are supposed to

1775
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,960
implement

1776
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,440
uh if they want to comply and with with

1777
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,200
our technology as specified here is is a

1778
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,359
last case that simple right

1779
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,319
don't do it just don't do it it's too

1780
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,599
difficult for this organization

1781
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,039
okay thanks uh phillip

1782
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,039
sorry we got some stale q entries here

1783
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,160
yeah uh a bit more phil handbake a bit

1784
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,039
more charter bashing uh it's saying the

1785
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,079
working group will define uh

1786
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,280
is a will a may or a shell

1787
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,039
so i i

1788
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,680
when it comes to media will be encrypted

1789
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,400
so what i'd like to do there is

1790
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,280
media shall be encrypted

1791
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,039
metadata may be encrypted

1792
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,240
media

1793
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,960
may be end to end encrypted

1794
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,000
for certain use cases in the what i'm

1795
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,079
wanting is to make sure that i'm going

1796
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,480
to be able to encrypt my metadata

1797
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,160
between the endpoints that make sense

1798
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,079
for me

1799
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,960
and not have a second working group have

1800
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,240
to spin up like happened without webrtc

1801
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,920
so i want that that that's why i want to

1802
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
have that in the chat i mean yeah we

1803
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,839
don't need to call it ends two ends or

1804
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,359
whatever

1805
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:08,960
and i think that's you know there's some

1806
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,720
wordsmithing that can go into the rest

1807
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,119
of the thing because uh

1808
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,039
i don't think you need the however

1809
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,880
outside the scope of the working group

1810
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,640
as it's a bit chatty

1811
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,200
uh thank you i would encourage you to

1812
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,440
open pr uh see if you have specific

1813
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,799
suggestions and that kind of goes for a

1814
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,559
lot of folks i think maybe have some

1815
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,480
things but yeah feel free to jump in and

1816
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,400
and contribute specific language where

1817
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
we can have a discussion

1818
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,599
uh next up spencer

1819
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,760
spencer dawkins and i'm counting on

1820
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,200
cullen to tell me if i'm saying

1821
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,420
something

1822
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,119
[Laughter]

1823
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,160
um

1824
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,039
so we've had uh discussion a bit on the

1825
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,720
mailing list i think uh most recently

1826
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,720
with

1827
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,920
about metadata not being monolithic

1828
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,960
that some metadata is as we've talked

1829
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,240
about it is helpful for

1830
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,160
relays and things like that to figure

1831
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,039
out how to how to best forward

1832
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,359
uh packets and things like that and

1833
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,479
other metadata is not that

1834
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,399
uh so um

1835
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,839
i don't know you know i don't know that

1836
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,600
we've i don't know that we've conversion

1837
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,679
of in discussions to be able to explain

1838
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:30,479
uh

1839
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,960
that in proposed charter text but i

1840
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,719
think that's important for us to keep in

1841
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,880
mind when we're having a discussion

1842
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,040
is that some of the metadata is going to

1843
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,520
be different from other metadata and for

1844
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,359
us to be able to figure out a way to

1845
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,719
describe that

1846
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,719
difference um

1847
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,399
in a way you know in a meaningful way

1848
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,839
because i think that is something that's

1849
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,439
important to keep in mind

1850
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,600
so my second question is actually

1851
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,759
just making sure i understand

1852
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,560
so you all want to see proposals for

1853
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,600
change

1854
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,960
text

1855
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,479
as prs

1856
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,439
in the repo for the charter

1857
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,920
i i guess if someone had specific

1858
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,759
uh

1859
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,600
changes or particularly grammar or

1860
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,920
things like it reads wordy uh

1861
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,679
it's probably easier for that person to

1862
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,719
open a pr uh if it's maybe maybe

1863
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,040
starting with an issue uh

1864
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,479
and since not everyone's following the

1865
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,399
repo uh for

1866
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,880
also copying the list maybe not be a bad

1867
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,799
idea

1868
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,719
so um and i would observe that the

1869
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,679
the mock mailing list uh does get the

1870
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,399
weekly summaries from the repo

1871
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,120
uh so for people to keep an eye on that

1872
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,439
um

1873
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,439
i'm not telling you that we spoke about

1874
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,719
things that were

1875
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,399
i'm sorry go ahead ted

1876
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,600
uh i was just gonna say one of the

1877
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,679
reasons i was asking for it just now was

1878
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,920
uh i may be able to then

1879
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,159
show the pr to the to the group by

1880
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,320
sharing my screen a little bit later

1881
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,800
um but i think we haven't quite got to

1882
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,760
that part in the discussion yet

1883
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,560
okay uh and and and thank you thank you

1884
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,760
yeah anything

1885
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,239
anything that will help me not submit

1886
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,199
some random piece of text that you guys

1887
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,800
have to merge in

1888
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,880
at you know at some level uh i would

1889
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
like to help you all be

1890
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,400
uh co-chairs

1891
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,440
um

1892
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,960
but uh

1893
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,840
so the other thing is uh

1894
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,679
if you if you all wanted to give

1895
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,520
guidance that uh

1896
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,159
if you're changing text uh you know

1897
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,440
saying

1898
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,679
you know say it this way that that's a

1899
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,239
that's a reasonable candidate for a pr

1900
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,560
but uh if you're saying

1901
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,120
we should be doing something different

1902
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,920
and i would say like the uh

1903
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,159
you know my early earlier suggestion

1904
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,840
about using the definition of live media

1905
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,280
uh from from a individual draft uh that

1906
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,280
that might be more

1907
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,120
more useful to have that discussion on

1908
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,760
the mailing list so that it can converge

1909
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,560
and

1910
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,000
uh the people

1911
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,159
do not have to try and

1912
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,159
figure out what to do with the competing

1913
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:13,159
prs

1914
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,000
i i just went

1915
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
sorry go ahead allen i just wanted to

1916
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,280
respond to one thing spencer said at the

1917
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,840
beginning which was about um metadata

1918
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,280
and that there was some attempt in the

1919
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,920
charter to to at least clarify the kinds

1920
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,199
of metadata

1921
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,120
that would be useful for transport

1922
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,520
relays and and whatnot and but i i think

1923
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,840
i heard you say you wanted

1924
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,719
more description

1925
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:37,840
or

1926
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,280
distinction distinguishing the kinds of

1927
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,920
metadata that wouldn't be available or

1928
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,520
that would be something for the working

1929
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,800
group to hash out

1930
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,000
this is spencer again so conveniently

1931
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,840
still in queue

1932
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,280
the um

1933
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,000
the thing i was trying to say was for

1934
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,880
and maybe the answer is that the

1935
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,840
charter recognizes that metadata is not

1936
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,760
monolithic and

1937
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,600
that the you know a working group

1938
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,719
responsibility will be to figure out

1939
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,239
what kind you know how to treat

1940
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,480
different kinds of metadata

1941
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,880
for different reasons i i would be i

1942
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,640
would be happy with that

1943
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,480
you know other people can do the right

1944
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,120
thing also thank you for clarifying

1945
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,640
uh uh ted you wanted to say something

1946
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,440
really good uh yeah so uh we ellen and i

1947
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,360
were kind of going uh in the side

1948
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,199
channel to talk a little bit about how

1949
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,040
we're gonna handle the mandatory day

1950
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,120
implement media format discussion and it

1951
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,480
occurred to us that it might be good to

1952
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,000
get a sense of the room obviously that

1953
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,080
we've had some good comments at the at

1954
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,560
the mic but what we're going to do is uh

1955
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,640
use the show of hand tool

1956
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,880
uh the question that will be in the show

1957
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,560
of hand tool is the charter should

1958
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,400
specify a mandatory to implement media

1959
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,560
format either on a use case specific

1960
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,120
basis or generally raising your hand

1961
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,520
would be a yes to this and

1962
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,760
uh choosing not to raise your hand in

1963
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,880
the tool

1964
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,199
would be a no the session is starting

1965
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,199
now

1966
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,600
yeah ted i don't know if you can extend

1967
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,440
the amount of time here but the

1968
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,520
sounds like some folks in the room uh

1969
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,360
lost the connection

1970
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,199
uh and mine's been very unstable as well

1971
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,280
so

1972
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,560
i don't think it will

1973
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,560
i don't think it will end until i end it

1974
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,040
manually at least at the moment

1975
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,280
okay

1976
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,280
can i get in like an actual show of

1977
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,679
hands for people who cannot get to the

1978
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,400
show of hands tool

1979
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,360
okay it looks like about five or six

1980
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,800
folks

1981
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,400
for one you need to ask the opposite of

1982
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,000
that too though the people who can't get

1983
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,920
to the do not raise hands tool need to

1984
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,520
not raise their hands by raising their

1985
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,520
hands

1986
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,920
okay we don't seem to be getting a lot

1987
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,199
more so through the tool what i see is

1988
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,040
um

1989
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,880
do not raise hand 63 raise hand 20.

1990
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,920
uh that's clearly not uh consensus in in

1991
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,920
either direction but it is definitely

1992
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,520
trending toward

1993
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,400
uh uh concern toward specifying a

1994
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,560
mandatory to uh to implement media

1995
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,360
format so i think um what we probably

1996
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,040
need to do here is to think if there's

1997
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,560
something else that

1998
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,000
that reaches us for that

1999
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,239
interoperability that's the desired goal

2000
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,880
of that mandatory to implement format

2001
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,120
but perhaps doesn't use

2002
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,199
that particular method so i think we'll

2003
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,159
take that

2004
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,679
as something that would be continued

2005
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,960
work on crafting the charter

2006
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,560
uh let's go back to the queue

2007
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,800
sorry go ahead thank you

2008
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,840
ted

2009
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,199
i

2010
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,719
i was probably just confused but i may

2011
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,640
not be the only person in the room you

2012
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,640
were hard on your mic's really over loud

2013
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,480
and i actually took your question to be

2014
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,520
about

2015
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,440
mandatory implement codex not formats

2016
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,880
when you ran that poll but you know my

2017
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,320
mistake um

2018
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,760
anyway i may not have been the only one

2019
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,239
confused

2020
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,080
uh

2021
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,560
it does seem like on the the mandatory

2022
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,040
into codex people were sort of it seemed

2023
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,719
to me that many people were speaking

2024
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,640
towards don't bother with them or if you

2025
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,760
do bother with them they won't mean

2026
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,679
anything anyway um so i'm fine with that

2027
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,120
type of charter change i don't think

2028
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,800
things i wanted to come back to the

2029
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,239
metadata for a minute because i think

2030
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,920
that that's the other one

2031
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,840
and

2032
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,120
uh i

2033
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,440
my my strong belief is the only thing

2034
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,000
that should go in this not encrypted

2035
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,520
stuff is stuff that the protocol

2036
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,600
mandatory won't work with if you

2037
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,120
encrypted it right there should be

2038
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,560
nothing that you could encrypt that you

2039
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,960
don't encrypt um for the indian

2040
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,560
encryption type stuff

2041
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,640
so we're talking about the you know it

2042
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,159
to put this in ip terms is to be like

2043
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,239
you can't encrypt the destination ip

2044
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,320
address like the network can't function

2045
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,920
if you do that right and this is the

2046
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,840
same thing what is the absolute stuff

2047
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,159
that the caches have to be able to see

2048
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,719
or the the middle servers need to be

2049
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:25,520
able

2050
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,360
the server needs to be able to see

2051
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,360
so that it can make the right decisions

2052
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,159
about uh what to forward next what media

2053
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,159
to flow uh congestion control those

2054
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:35,440
types of things there should be nothing

2055
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,760
else i i thought we had tried to make

2056
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,480
that clear in the charter i i i regret

2057
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,159
using the word meta yeah i wish we

2058
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,520
hadn't used metadata there but i think

2059
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,120
that we need to try and phrase it in

2060
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,840
that type of form that you know there

2061
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,520
will be some data that when you're using

2062
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,800
an encryption there'll be some data

2063
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,640
that's only authenticated and that

2064
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,800
authenticated data will only include

2065
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,719
stuff that's absolutely necessary for

2066
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,640
the functioning of the protocol

2067
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,640
um and i think that that would resolve a

2068
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,040
bunch of php's concerns and is better

2069
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,000
aligned to what many people in the

2070
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,040
working group thought it meant in the

2071
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,080
first place

2072
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,480
uh and it's not just some vague envelope

2073
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,560
where all kinds of like

2074
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,640
privacy creepy stuff can be said thanks

2075
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,840
thank you ecker

2076
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,719
yeah i i think that'd be a fine

2077
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,880
suggestion from cullen though i suspect

2078
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,239
we'll find this thing as extensible and

2079
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,679
then all kinds of creepy privacy stuff

2080
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,920
can be sent in it um

2081
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,080
um so richard barnes and i independently

2082
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,760
produced two pr's that attempt to like

2083
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,440
encode this discussion about um

2084
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,520
encryption i think either would be fine

2085
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,480
um so uh please take a look those are 59

2086
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,320
and 60 um probably 60s which is his a

2087
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,719
little stronger um i'm still i think a

2088
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,440
little confused about the um

2089
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,960
uh

2090
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,159
the the the text um about

2091
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,520
uh i'm sorry can come on the

2092
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,840
um the thing about the authentication of

2093
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,320
um of clients for access i think maybe

2094
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,199
the next slide i'm not sure

2095
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,440
oh okay uh oh yeah yeah here we go so

2096
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,600
this last this last so i think this

2097
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,640
first um sentence i tried to read i i

2098
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,199
i'm trying to rewrite um about because i

2099
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,480
think it just means um a way to

2100
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,840
demonstrate to the relay you should get

2101
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,920
the media or the way to demonstrate the

2102
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,520
relay that you should be enabled in just

2103
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,640
media um so that seems easy um and i can

2104
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,000
fix that but i don't understand what the

2105
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,320
type of the comma means um and so maybe

2106
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,360
someone could come up with the stuff for

2107
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,400
the common means then we could write the

2108
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,120
text so it says that

2109
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,600
okay thanks suhas

2110
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,040
i had uh notes um on the transport

2111
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,040
method on the metadata which is very

2112
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,640
similar to what colors

2113
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,199
um i kind of just want to echo that um

2114
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:54,960
and and it can make it clear that it's

2115
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,360
more more of a metadata for

2116
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,040
things in the middle that do not want to

2117
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,719
access media or don't need to access

2118
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,719
media but want to work on it

2119
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,120
to make the decisions to forward or drop

2120
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,719
react to condition control we need to

2121
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:07,679
help

2122
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,120
that's the only way we can make this

2123
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,760
relays to be really casual and also

2124
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,000
performance and scalable as well

2125
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,360
and on the

2126
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,640
thing about

2127
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,159
relay discovery uh uh and and i i

2128
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,920
personally feel that dash kind of should

2129
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,840
be outside the scope of this working

2130
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,600
group maybe an architecture document

2131
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,159
could specify uh some of some of the

2132
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,520
like informal

2133
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,000
ways to do that but we the working group

2134
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,080
itself should not take

2135
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,480
to define mechanisms to with that

2136
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,799
thank you

2137
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,159
uh okay uh alyssa

2138
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,239
alyssa cooper um

2139
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,159
i was just uh reflecting a little bit

2140
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,360
about the relationship between the

2141
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,520
webrtc charter and what happened in

2142
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,719
webrtc uh with the codex situation to

2143
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,080
try to

2144
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,719
think about this in that frame and um

2145
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,320
you know we ended up with different

2146
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,840
requirements for different kinds of

2147
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,600
endpoints webrtc browser webrtc

2148
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,120
non-browser

2149
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,920
and webrtc compatible something or other

2150
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,360
endpoint

2151
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,320
and

2152
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,840
i was just wondering if thinking about

2153
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,000
that thinking about it from the client

2154
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,800
perspective um might cut through this a

2155
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,159
little bit because it sounded like when

2156
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,679
luke was talking it's

2157
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,520
it's really about this difference

2158
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,840
between a situation where you

2159
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,639
want

2160
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,960
the node serving the media to be able to

2161
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,639
dictate uh what the format should be

2162
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,560
and it's acceptable to have a loss of

2163
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,960
interoperability um whereas other

2164
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,480
situations where

2165
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,800
it's very important to be able to have

2166
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,679
that

2167
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,159
authority live with the clients

2168
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,400
um that you'll you'll cut out a lot of

2169
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,679
um

2170
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,120
opportunity for independent clients to

2171
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,360
be part of the ecosystem if there isn't

2172
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,320
um a baseline specified and so maybe

2173
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,639
that's a way to i find the concept of

2174
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,639
doing it on a use case by use case basis

2175
01:20:58,639 --> 01:20:59,520
um

2176
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,400
a little bit

2177
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,480
unsatisfactory but i still do think that

2178
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,159
you need to have common baselines in

2179
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,159
some of these cases so maybe that's a

2180
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,480
way to cut through it but then i was

2181
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,639
also thinking that had we specified

2182
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,159
tried to specify these categories of

2183
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,480
clients in the webrtc case ahead of time

2184
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,560
that never would have happened because

2185
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,000
it took like many years to come to that

2186
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,320
sort of compromise so i feel like you

2187
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,520
need something in the charter that's

2188
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,360
generic enough to capture this but

2189
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,840
doesn't overly specify all the different

2190
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,159
subsets with different requirements

2191
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,000
thanks just a note we're going to cut

2192
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
the queue soon

2193
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,239
so if you have something you want to say

2194
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,199
uh

2195
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,600
please get yourself in the cube

2196
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
i don't know mosinetti i think

2197
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,000
elizabeth's a good point about um

2198
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
the different uh device types rather

2199
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,360
than use cases

2200
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,600
and what may not be clear in the charter

2201
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,679
is there's clearly

2202
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:52,960
two different device types there's

2203
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,120
subscribers and publishers that's one

2204
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,440
type of device and there's or

2205
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,440
entity let's not say device and then

2206
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,920
there's servers relays and caches which

2207
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,199
for the most part

2208
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,880
should not know or care

2209
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,320
what the media formats are if we do our

2210
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,000
job right it's just the transport

2211
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,120
protocol it's not actually going to

2212
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,719
operate on any of the media so it

2213
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,000
shouldn't require the indian keys it

2214
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,120
shouldn't require knowledge of the

2215
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,040
formats and all of that so i think it

2216
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,960
may be useful to

2217
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,920
if there's going to be something

2218
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,960
mandatory

2219
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,360
to implement in codec formats it should

2220
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,880
only impact the subscribers and

2221
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,199
publishers and not anything else in the

2222
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,080
chain

2223
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,120
um

2224
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,400
and on on the encryption um

2225
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,159
i think uh

2226
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,840
there was a suggestion that i put on the

2227
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,800
mailing list about explicitly defining

2228
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,120
naming the word transport metadata

2229
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,280
as what the protocol operates on and can

2230
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,880
see and access

2231
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,000
um and we may not we'll probably

2232
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,159
probably won't be able to describe it in

2233
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:49,600
detail in the charter i think it's going

2234
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,400
to be

2235
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,480
something for future work in the actual

2236
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,080
you know documents that come out but i

2237
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,600
think it may be useful to have something

2238
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,800
in the charter

2239
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,719
to nail the concept of transport

2240
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,800
metadata that is accessible to the

2241
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,080
relays i think right now it just says um

2242
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,040
uh

2243
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,000
a method of you know of accessing some

2244
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,159
data such as and gives examples i think

2245
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,760
just having a word for it transport

2246
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,480
metadata and then all all other data

2247
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,760
besides that be it content or metadata

2248
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,840
can be optional and encrypted but we

2249
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,400
still need to indicate where that where

2250
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,840
that's taking place the protocol needs

2251
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,199
to specify

2252
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,600
where that end-to-end uh encryption is

2253
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,440
taking place and not just have it

2254
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,440
publishers and subscribers know this is

2255
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,000
drm content and this is not drm content

2256
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,199
and then

2257
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,560
i think we also need to have some people

2258
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,800
that um liaise with

2259
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,600
uh the the mpeg forms about common

2260
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,800
encryption because there's been a lot of

2261
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,000
work done

2262
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
uh among publishers and device makers to

2263
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,800
not have to uh have multiple formats and

2264
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,239
input common encryption may be useful

2265
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,000
for that and that may be something that

2266
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,080
we can um we can leverage in this in

2267
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,639
this work too

2268
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:02,760
okay thanks victor

2269
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,880
uh victor vasilev goggle uh two things

2270
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,320
first to the point that uh if we do our

2271
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,920
job right

2272
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,760
transport should not be aware about

2273
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,880
format

2274
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,280
i i'm not entirely sure that there's a

2275
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,800
case because

2276
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,920
part of

2277
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,639
the girls of mark is to be able to

2278
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:27,360
intelligently choose one to drop

2279
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,840
uh

2280
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,719
of uh

2281
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:31,920
give us

2282
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,280
selected chunks of media so or

2283
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,239
that

2284
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,639
pretty much imply that might imply that

2285
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,040
we need to have a more advanced

2286
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,560
knowledge of

2287
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,480
what's actually in the medias and being

2288
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,000
a near transport

2289
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,199
uh my

2290
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,800
second point i wanted to make is

2291
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,159
regarding

2292
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,800
simple method of authentication

2293
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,080
that's never a good wording because

2294
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,480
whenever i think of something simple

2295
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,400
message authentication i think of

2296
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,719
something like stun

2297
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:03,760
oh

2298
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,960
it is

2299
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,199
oh

2300
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,840
yes encrypted with md5 oh

2301
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,600
uh

2302
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,040
we might want to just leave this out of

2303
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,719
the charter and

2304
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,080
leave it as an extension

2305
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,719
okay thanks eric

2306
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,159
on the

2307
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,199
on the topic of caching as well as

2308
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,159
whether

2309
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,480
um intermediates need to be able to view

2310
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,719
content i think one thing that's

2311
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,440
really worth keeping in mind is that

2312
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,719
there's a

2313
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,719
live and on demand are not the only

2314
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,199
things that a lot of um for many of the

2315
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:52,719
use cases kind of the semi live and dvr

2316
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,639
style cons

2317
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,440
use cases where people can go back and

2318
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,840
be watching live slightly delayed or

2319
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,400
rewind a little bit

2320
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,239
play very heavily into this so a lot of

2321
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,719
these systems end up being one where

2322
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,679
where there's a very blurry line between

2323
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:10,719
live

2324
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:12,800
live semi live dvr

2325
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,560
in and on demand

2326
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,560
and

2327
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,480
how that fits into caching and how that

2328
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,639
fits into middle boxes

2329
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,920
it's something that we'll want to need

2330
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,440
to figure out early on if we want to be

2331
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,360
able to handle those use cases

2332
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,679
um or versus purely being a transport

2333
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,920
okay thanks i think ted's gonna go

2334
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,880
through some uh pr

2335
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
okay uh so thanks everybody there were a

2336
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,120
lot of good suggestions for uh updates

2337
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,320
to the charter during the course of

2338
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,080
today's discussion it's good to see so

2339
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,199
much energy

2340
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:50,880
uh in the queue whether it's a remote or

2341
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,159
um

2342
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,480
uh in in the room there were a couple

2343
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,520
filed here and i believe um two of them

2344
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,960
kind of overlap

2345
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,360
i'm going to show uh

2346
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,600
60 rather than 59 based on some comments

2347
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,800
in the chat

2348
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,560
um but i'm just going to go through

2349
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,199
these very quickly uh if you have like

2350
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,120
very very serious heartburn please add

2351
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,719
yourself to the queue to let us know

2352
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:13,760
what that is

2353
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,520
um but just to let you know what the

2354
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,719
proposals discussed were

2355
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,760
so this was just um uh making this more

2356
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,159
general to to add or other mechanism

2357
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,600
uh this one as i believe we discussed

2358
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600
was to remove push from a round protocol

2359
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,719
and i'm not even going to click through

2360
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,960
that since it's a deletion of a single

2361
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,840
word

2362
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,080
uh this one as we discussed was to add

2363
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,840
mops to the working group coordination

2364
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,199
list

2365
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,840
again that's a very quick one and this

2366
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,440
is the the more complex one

2367
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,239
uh that updates the

2368
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,440
um

2369
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
the encryption discussion i'll give

2370
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,239
folks a minute to read that

2371
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,239
okay uh is there anybody with serious

2372
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,040
heartburn who needs to join the queue to

2373
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,560
tell us why these

2374
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,840
uh prs should not be accepted

2375
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,520
i don't see anybody in the queue here or

2376
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,960
online

2377
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,040
uh so budget said that the left side of

2378
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,239
the room can't see it

2379
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,520
uh okay so and eric wants me to click

2380
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,000
the files changed tab so all the changes

2381
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,760
rolled together

2382
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,040
uh let's see here i think i have to move

2383
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,280
out of that

2384
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,599
so that would be the first change

2385
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,520
okay uh so i think what that is telling

2386
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,280
us is that at the end of this meeting

2387
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,800
we'll we'll be accepting those prs and

2388
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,360
we'll now go on to

2389
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,360
uh to ask some of the questions that are

2390
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,520
the buff questions so i'm going to stop

2391
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,280
the screen share now but as you'll see

2392
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,520
in the chat there is a

2393
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,280
link to the the polls and uh a related

2394
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,840
set of things sorry uh it looks like

2395
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,880
yeah jumped up and just got in the queue

2396
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,639
ted there was one more pr that came in

2397
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,320
from ecker that looks quite good to me

2398
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,760
while you were doing that so maybe we

2399
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,320
could just do that one as well

2400
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:24,120
okay let me look for that

2401
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,880
uh thanks to people want to take a quick

2402
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,880
look at this and again the same applies

2403
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,719
if you see a need

2404
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,639
to leap into the into the queue to tell

2405
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,560
us why this is wrong please do so

2406
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,159
okay i don't see anybody leaping into

2407
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:18,320
the queue there either once again these

2408
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,080
are of course all

2409
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,199
uh

2410
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,920
on the github repo and we can uh

2411
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,679
encourage people to

2412
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,000
file comments there

2413
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,719
if

2414
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,080
if you don't have a chance to do the

2415
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:33,600
comments here in the room

2416
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,560
okay we're now going to move on to the

2417
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,719
um

2418
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,360
uh the buff questions give give me a

2419
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,199
chance here to start the show of hands

2420
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:54,199
tool

2421
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,400
okay apologies uh i seem to have closed

2422
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,239
the window where i had all of these

2423
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:29,839
locked up so it'll take me just a second

2424
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,960
talk amongst yourselves

2425
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,960
guys

2426
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,520
um

2427
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,960
so in case anyone missed it the poll is

2428
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,960
up

2429
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,159
um

2430
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,400
okay i've now discovered that you cannot

2431
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,159
actually unmute yourself once you've

2432
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,480
started a poll uh thank you to whoever

2433
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,040
it was that actually said the poll is up

2434
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,880
now um

2435
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,119
uh so spencer as is clear in one of the

2436
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,760
later um ones uh when we talk about the

2437
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,159
problem statement we mean after after

2438
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,800
the discussion in the room uh that's uh

2439
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,560
also clear when we will start talking

2440
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,320
about the charter so give us a second

2441
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,199
for the next buff question

2442
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,320
yep

2443
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,360
okay the poll appears to be out

2444
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,560
okay uh i haven't seen any additional

2445
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,719
entries in uh

2446
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:19,440
oh

2447
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,360
one just came in

2448
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,679
two just come in we'll give it another

2449
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,960
uh 30 seconds then

2450
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,520
we can all just also just come in the

2451
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,960
room if we like humming

2452
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,960
just

2453
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,119
come on you miss the hums you know you

2454
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,280
do

2455
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,159
okay i

2456
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,679
i

2457
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,600
i think it's probably okay to end the

2458
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,400
session now so i'm going to do so oh no

2459
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,159
still a couple

2460
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,080
slinking in

2461
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,400
um

2462
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,960
all right so that was 62 folks raised

2463
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,800
their hand that they were willing to

2464
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,320
review documents or comment on the

2465
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,400
mailing list of working group should be

2466
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,719
formed uh nine people

2467
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:13,199
deliberately did not uh raise their hand

2468
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,440
indicating they would not be willing and

2469
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,199
i'll point out that there are 152 people

2470
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,000
in the aggregate here so there's

2471
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,440
definitely quite a few people who are

2472
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,080
choosing not to answer

2473
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,080
uh

2474
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,480
and once again i have lost the

2475
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:22,280
okay this next one is starting now

2476
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,520
foreign

2477
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,159
okay we seem to have reached the end of

2478
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,840
folks actively participating in the poll

2479
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,880
so i'll end this session

2480
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,560
um

2481
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,280
the final question uh really isn't a

2482
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,159
show of hands style question uh it's for

2483
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,840
anyone who does not think a working

2484
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,920
group should be formed uh do you wish to

2485
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,360
address the

2486
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,159
uh the both addressing your concerns and

2487
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,840
i did notice that there was one person

2488
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,760
who apparently raised and then lowered

2489
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,360
and raised and then lowered and raised

2490
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,440
and then lowered their hand a number of

2491
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,360
times so if you feel wishy-washy about

2492
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,760
it and wish to address the buff with

2493
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,760
your concerns

2494
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,360
you're also welcome to join the queue

2495
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,360
now

2496

okay i don't think anybody i'm not

2497
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,480
seeing anyone leap up to the mic queue

2498
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,280
and no one is in the queue

2499
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,280
uh it is traditional at this moment then

2500
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,199
for us to turn it over to our area

2501
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,040
director to ask if there are any other

2502
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,119
questions the area director would like

2503
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,880
asked or any comments the area director

2504
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,360

2518
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,040

01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,600
thank you thank you for that correction

2521
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,760
uh suhas would you like to talk about

2522
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,159

okay uh thank you ted and alan for

2525
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:50,080
driving the uh the buff um i'll try to

2526
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,920
give a quick overview of what figure is

2527
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,159
um it's it's a media delivery protocol

2528
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,000
for quick uh i'll start by setting up

2529
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,760
some context on why we started thinking

2530
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,639
about

2531
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:01,280
currency

2532
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,600
can you speak louder and maybe a little

2533
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,199
ironically for me slower

2534
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,239
okay if it comes from across i'll try to

2535
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,639
slaughter

2536
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,119
okay so uh i try to try to talk about

2537
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,080
quicker

2538
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,840
um

2539
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,520
the college is here

2540
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,920
i i wonder maybe if we should just move

2541
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,760
this to an offline meeting or some other

2542
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,960
time or something

2543
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,800
to us the problem is we're just having a

2544
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,639
really hard time understanding you in

2545
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,320
the room um so i i i i don't know how

2546
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,080
important this is right now unless colin

2547
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,199
you want to speak to the slides since

2548
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:43,799
you're here no i won't go for lunch okay

2549
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,560
uh sue is that okay since we're having a

2550
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,840
hard time hearing you or

2551
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,000
yeah i think would you like to try to

2552
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,639
scold her through uh i think that's a

2553
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,280
fine suggestion uh we can do an offline

2554
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,960
meeting and talk about more technical

2555
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,199
details

2556
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,280
okay okay uh if that's going to be the

2557
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,520
case i think probably one of the things

2558
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,239
that alan and i will uh chat with the

2559
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,880
area directors uh that if they do in

2560
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,600
fact form a a working group based on

2561
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,520
today's uh buff

2562
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,840
that we will probably want to schedule a

2563
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,280
pretty early

2564
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,560
interim meeting uh before 115

2565
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,840
so we can start the technical

2566
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,719
discussions um in since this this

2567
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,560
meeting was very firmly

2568
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,960
uh focused on uh charter scope and

2569
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,360
charter language uh there really weren't

2570
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,199
um a whole lot of technical discussions

2571
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:38,880
which might uh

2572
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,560
might have taken place here hopefully

2573
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,159
those of you in philadelphia are having

2574
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,239
wonderful hallway conversations

2575
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,800
uh to do that but that we might want to

2576
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,520
schedule um some sort of interim meeting

2577
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,639
on online or in person uh to try and get

2578
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:54,800
those technical uh discussions kicked

2579
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,360
off again uh pending the decision of the

2580
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,880
isg and the

2581
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,920
uh and and any final charter changes

2582
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,600
uh does that make sense to folks uh

2583
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,560
look like spencer isn't cute

2584
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:11,280
uh spencer dawkins uh ted if i could

2585
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,840
make what i hope is a friendly amendment

2586
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,280
um

2587
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,679
i can't think of a good reason for

2588
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,800
box to not be able to request an interim

2589
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,600
meeting to work on charter texts and

2590
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,360
things like that

2591
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,880
if that i'm not saying that that would

2592
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,400
be a good plan

2593
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,000
but if the chairs thought that that

2594
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,600
would be a good plan

2595
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,679
uh you might want to you might want to

2596
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,600
explore with the area directors whether

2597
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,719
that would be

2598
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:41,440
uh something that you could do as well

2599
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,960
um

2600
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,560
you know

2601
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,719
i just so you know november is a long

2602
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:50,719
time away and for us to be able to have

2603
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:51,679
a

2604
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,480
higher bit rate exchange uh between now

2605
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,360
and then

2606
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,960
if if

2607
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,679
if getting chartered is problematic

2608
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,480
that might be useful as well

2609
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,639
uh yep if it turns out that the the

2610
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,400
community needs to discuss charter

2611
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,480
changes that the iasg

2612
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,000
or the

2613
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,360
broader community requires we can

2614
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,600
definitely do that as well but i was

2615
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,880
also thinking

2616
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,280
that the technical discussions uh would

2617
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,480
be

2618
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,119
a great type of conversation for a get

2619
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,360
together online or in person

2620
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,080
uh sometime between now and 115 if if

2621
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,239
that made sense so if there

2622
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:29,760
if there's no

2623
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,920
comments on that we can let people go

2624
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,560
off to lunch

2625
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,480
okay thank you everybody for coming and

2626

let's make one anyway
