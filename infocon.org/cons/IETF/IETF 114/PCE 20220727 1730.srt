1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,279
uh

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
um

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,320
so i think we can start

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,040
hello everyone

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
sorry about you

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,600
so this is the past competition element

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,120
working obsession

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
the first one of the the two that you

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,879
can see

10
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,079
summarized here

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
so first of all

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
people on site are supposed to wear

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,520
masks so

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,879
i'm

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,320
the the picture

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
this too far to to check if everyone

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
is doing it but uh i guess harry can

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
have a look at that and there are some

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
available at the registration desk if i

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
understood correctly if you need one so

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840
please try to follow

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
that people for safety of everyone

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
okay

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
so

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
usual not well

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
this is an etf meeting there are rules

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
about ipr

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,880
you're supposed to follow that

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
sorry okay

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
so make sure you are

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
aware of those rules and that you are

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,640
following them

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
most of the things you do when

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
contributing to the etf is subject to

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
some ipr rules so

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
supposed to be aware of all them and

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
make sure that

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
you

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
rewrote you wrote

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,719
those

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
references here

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
you read

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,039
them okay

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,479
so there are many people remote again

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
this time so

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,480
the tool that we're using to

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
share remote session is a new version of

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
mythical

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
there's a new mythical client that may

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
help people on site but for most people

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
remote i think the

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
heavy

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
mythical client is still the the one to

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
use

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
make sure your audio is off when you

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
aren't supposed to talk to avoid

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
glitches

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
we have a

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
queueing

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
rule there

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
there's a single queue that mixes both

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
the

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
the light client for people on site on

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
the

65
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,440
usual

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
mythical queue

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,680
for people remote so make sure that even

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
if you're on site you join the queue

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,159
from mexico that will help the chair to

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
control the queue and give the floor to

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,239
people in a proper order

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,200
in case of issue on site harry is over

73
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,519
there you can see him sitting on the

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
desk so

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
be gentle to him

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,360
and

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
he will be the one

78
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,720
taking over in case of issue for remote

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
shells

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
so the usual links

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,640
uh

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
so if you want to go over the agenda and

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,239
other useful information there

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
in the slide deck

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
uh

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
usual kind of conduct within the etf

87
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,159
i hope everyone is familiar with them

88
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
nothing new there but

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
make sure that you are familiar with

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,000
them

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
so travel now our remote again

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
hopefully this will

93
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,120
reduce in the upcoming meetings but

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
we're still remote harry is there

95
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
john already is already there in case of

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,040
a

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,478
strong issue

98
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
for the session on site

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,918
so

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
harry on top of being on site will be in

101
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
charge of taking notes so if you want to

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
give him a hand there is the link here

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800

in case of

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
mix up with names or if something you

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
may have set on the mic isn't properly

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
noted in the minutes

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
your contribution is very helpful to the

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
total notes of the meeting

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
we have a tight agenda as usual

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,479
so

115
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
make sure that we are

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
following the time

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
some usual reminders

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
we know that

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
following the

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
values lockdowns travel constraints the

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
involvement in some

122
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,479
work in the etf is not the same as

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,680
before

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
but working group still needs some

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
involvement to make sure the work

126
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
progresses efficiently so

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
please try to evoke as much as possible

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
especially at adoption polls working

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
glass call

130
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
document reviews the

131
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
ietf working group documents need some

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,039
people to be involved all along the

133
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
process so make sure that

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
when you're involved or interested in

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
some topic you voice your opinion

136
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
contribute on even if it's more remotely

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,919
than it used to be for some of us it's

138
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
still very important to make

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
proper use of the mailing list on

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,240
get involved into the threads on the

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,759
mailing list

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,319
there is the new delete tool for the the

143
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
chat so it's turned out to the medical

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
chat there onto the former jabber

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
service so far

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
uh if you want to join using the

147
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
client it's another way to to

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,400
chat with the working group

149
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,599
okay the agenda

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
hopefully

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
no one wants to bash anything from the

152
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,199
agenda

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,680
okay so

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
consider

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
it's okay so keep in mind that only half

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
of the time to the pc working room is

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
today on the other half will happen

158
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,280
tomorrow

159
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
working group status

160
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,919
okay

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
there is no newer test in the the last

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
ietf meeting

163
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
but the walking route has been producing

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
some document anyway

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
uh one of them has been in the rfc

166
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
editor queue for a while and is waiting

167
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,240
for a

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
reference

169
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,919
to another document

170
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,880
uh

171
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
this is

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
something that will progress in the near

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
future so

174
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
no

175
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
no fear there this

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
supposed to be resolved in the coming

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
months

178
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
three other documents are

179
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,840
within the 80s hand with some

180
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
publication requested

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
for association for extended flags on

182
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,919
stateful gmpls extensions

183
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,879
so

184
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
those were sent to the ig yes iesg will

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,680
progress

186
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
hopefully by the next itf meeting

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
uh other news from the working group

188
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
you may have noticed that today

189
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
another ipr disclosure was sent to the

190
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,560
pc mailing list

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
it's about

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
flow spec rfc

193
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,319
so

194
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,520
we need to

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,940
have a look at this

196
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,280
[Music]

197
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,680
disclosure on the issue of concern

198
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
please use the mailing list there to

199
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
start discussing on two other

200
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
were sent earlier this year

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
one of them is about a working group

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
draft

203
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
about multipass on the other one is

204
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
about

205
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
the effect which is on today's agenda

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
um

207
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,160
healthier location so

208
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
you were aware that the utf has mayana

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
holly allocation could point policy

210
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,640
we have several documents that have been

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
following this process to get early code

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
points for early implementations

213
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
so we have those four already identified

214
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
within the ayanna virtue for the

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
required cut points

216
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
some were already renewed depending on

217
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
the progress of the document within the

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,560
working good process

219
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,839
if you believe that your

220
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
specifications requires some

221
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
holy cut points for

222
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
some

223
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
interrupt testing early implementations

224
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,800
and so on

225
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
please contact the chairs and

226
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
we'll share with the working group

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,600
to to coach about the consensus on

228
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
triggering the early allocation policy

229
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
for each

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,279
case that we receive

231
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
document status do you want to take the

232
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,120
floor draft from there

233
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,080
let me get back the slide control

234
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
yes hi hi everyone so let's just talk a

235
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
little bit about all the working group

236
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
documents that we have

237
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
and i would also urge the authors to

238
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
join the queue if they would like to add

239
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
something and give an update to the

240
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,839
working group

241
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
so first we have a document that we have

242
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
recently done a working group last call

243
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,440
on that is the local protection

244
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,240
enforcement currently it is waiting for

245
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
shepard review it's in julian's hand so

246
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
you should be expecting uh the review of

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,800
this pretty soon and then we will be

248
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
sending it out

249
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,839
uh to our ap

250
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
piece up yet uh we have a recent update

251
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
this update handles the second yang

252
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,839
doctor review that was done for this

253
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,279
document

254
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
as a part of yang doctor's review

255
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
there was a section on objectives for

256
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
this young model and this was found to

257
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
be little repetitive and pretty standard

258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
so we moved it to appendix rather than

259
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
to the core of the document

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
there was a comment on uh bicep mip that

261
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
since we borrow a lot of elements from

262
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
psep map it would be good to have a

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
clear relationship so we have added an

264
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
apple x where we have relationship

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
between the pset gang and a psep mip so

266
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,079
which would be quite useful

267
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
we did change some names of the leaves

268
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
as per the yang practices

269
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
some groupings which were used only once

270
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
were collapsed

271
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
and since we had

272
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,040
completed work on stateful gmpls we also

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
added stateful gm plus capability into

274
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,519
the yang model

275
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,480
and some examples were updated and with

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
the help of a tool they were validated

277
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
as well

278
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
so at this stage this document is uh

279
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
quite ready for working group last call

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
we can see all the dependencies on the

281
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
right hand side as well

282
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
and uh even the dependency that we were

283
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
worried about which was itf tls client

284
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
and server they are making progress in

285
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
netconf so i think

286
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
it's the right time to

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
send this document and last call this

288
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
and since i'm the author of this

289
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
document uh julian would be running the

290
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
process

291
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
the next one

292
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
is

293
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,360
our srv6 document it underwent two

294
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
updates

295
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,880
uh there is already an ina allocation

296
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
which is done

297
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,519
uh be enhanced the authors enhanced the

298
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
security consideration section and

299
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,399
mainly all other changes were editorial

300
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
and since we were we already have one

301
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
document in rfc editor queue which is

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,880
waiting for this uh we should prioritize

303
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,279
this and uh last call this and send it

304
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
out of the working group pretty soon so

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,399
if anybody has any comments doubts uh

306
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
like you know please feel free to

307
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
join the queue and

308
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
authors or anybody else who has concerns

309
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
on these documents this is your time

310
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
to use it otherwise i will continue with

311
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,200
the next document

312
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
uh some of the documents which are

313
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
almost ready but did not have much

314
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,079
update between the two itfs are the

315
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
native ip

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
and flex grid

317
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
we will be taking them up soon so if you

318
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
want to review them and make sure that

319
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
they are up to date this would be a good

320
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,680
time to do that

321
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,639
one document which did not see any

322
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
progress neither from the chair side or

323
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
from the working group

324
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
in the last meeting we asked for more

325
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
feedback on what we could do about the

326
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,639
enhanced errors uh document uh we still

327
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,279
have no id which is currently using it

328
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
we thought stateful interdomain could be

329
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,720
won

330
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,560
but there hasn't been an update on that

331
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
and we haven't received any feedback but

332
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
as a working group we have to make a

333
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
decision on what we are going to do with

334
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,760
this document uh we are still listening

335
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
so reach out to us if you have an

336
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
opinion on this

337
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
the other working group ids

338
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,760
we have a path segment

339
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
with this path segment there has been no

340
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
change but one thing which i wanted to

341
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
from the chairs point of view we wanted

342
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,320
to highlight is currently this document

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
is listing two mechanisms uh via it

344
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,000
allows path segment allocation via path

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,760
segment tlv it also allows the pcc

346
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
mechanism to allocate a path segment so

347
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
we want to make sure that that we have

348
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
the working group backing that both

349
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,079
these mechanisms should be supported or

350
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
do we need to discuss and

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
like you know support only a single one

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
of these so this discussion has not

353
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
happened and we feel that this document

354
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
is otherwise ready so this is the only

355
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
open issue that we could see so if the

356
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
working group or the authors have any

357
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
opinion on this

358
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,120
please come now or use the mailing list

359
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
to discuss this further but this is one

360
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
issue that we will be tracking

361
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,440
and seeing nobody jumping the queue i'll

362
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
continue

363
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
the next one is the bi-directional sr

364
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,839
path it had no change and we feel this

365
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,120
document is

366
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
quite ready for last call as well so if

367
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
anybody has any concerns

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
or authors have any opinion please let

369
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,120
us know

370
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
and all this information is also

371
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,480
captured in the wiki so if you would

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,639
like to go and update the wiki please do

373
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,560
that it's the wiki is for the whole

374
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,880
working group not just for the chairs so

375
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
please provide inputs in the wiki as

376
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
well as your document is

377
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
if the document has any issues or need

378
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,560
some help

379
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,758
from others etc

no comments just thank you thank you for

384
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
the work we we do really think the uh

385
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,519
segment and as a bi-directional past

386
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
drafts are ready for the working rascal

387
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
so thank you for the work

388
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
yep that's it

389
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,040
uh cheng regarding the question that we

390
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,360
have on the uh just that we have two

391
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,759
mechanisms is there any opinion of the

392
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
authors that yes we need to continue

393
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
with the

394
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
both mechanisms in the draft that's the

395
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
current let's go for both mechanism

396
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
right now and if someone uh propose some

397
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
comments on the main list let's discuss

398
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,199
it directly

399
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,800
okay

400
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,439
okay thank you

401
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,279
so

402
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
next one we have uh

403
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
uh sr policy drafts

404
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,320
this one had an update uh this update

405
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
added i've made an update in the

406
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
invalidation tlv

407
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
for traffic steering

408
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,480
for a down and an invalid lsp so please

409
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
review if you have any concerns with

410
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,160
this update

411
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
with pcc sr

412
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,240
there was another update and the main

413
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
technical change was uh there was text

414
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,599
added for any cast sid allocation which

415
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,959
was missing

416
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,119
so i think this is a good uh update that

417
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,039
they have done and uh please review

418
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
uh regarding the multi-path draft there

419
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
were multiple updates

420
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
uh main updates were in multipath

421
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
opposite direction path dlv

422
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
they also added an implementation status

423
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
section which lists three existing

424
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
implementations which is very good to

425
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
know and the earlier location has also

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
been done for this draft so good

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,679
progress is being made in the multipath

428
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
document

429
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,919
the other document that we have is the

430
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,880
state sync between the pce's

431
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
uh two updates uh adding implementation

432
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
status adding manageability

433
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
consideration

434
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,400
and one open issue uh at least from the

435
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,520
chairs point of view is this document

436
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
has a section on how primary and

437
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
secondary pcs are selected

438
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
uh but and it is done based on priority

439
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,200
but how this priority is advertised is

440
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,440
currently out of scope of the document

441
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,280
so we want to get feedback from the

442
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
working group that whether it is

443
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,919
acceptable

444
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,400
uh that yes let that be outside this

445
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
could be done via configuration or yang

446
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
and like you know of course in future it

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
can also be done by uh capability like

448
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,520
advertisement etc but it's okay to be

449
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
out of scope of the current document so

450
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,559
we want to hear

451
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
uh inputs from folks especially on that

452
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,039
point

453
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
uh next document we have is optional

454
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,240
this is uh like marking

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,799
objects as optional to process in case

456
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
of stateful pc

457
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
and implementation status was added but

458
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,799
it currently lists there are no known

459
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,799
implementation i wanted to poll the

460
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,559
working group that please let us know

461
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,480
please let authors know if you are

462
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
implementing any of the working group

463
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
documents so that it can be captured

464
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
in the implementation status section

465
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,799
and i

466
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,880
i fear that there might be an

467
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,559
implementation for this but we don't

468
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
have the data so please reach out to the

469
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,799
working group chairs and authors for

470
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
this

471
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
the stateful inter domain saw no change

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
uh between the last uh itf

473
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,440
and the sr uh p2mp policy had uh update

474
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
and it was on mainly editorial changes

475
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
so far

476
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
and now we are coming to the i think the

477
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
final sets uh

478
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
of the document

479
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
which were kind of recently adopted we

480
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
had the l2 flow spec

481
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
this document was updated they added a

482
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,960
manageability consideration and they are

483
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,080
trying to

484
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
uh keep in sync with flow spec v2 work

485
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
that has been done in idr so that is

486
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,679
good

487
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,640
uh we have the document for algorithm

488
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
said algor algo

489
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
this was adopted in feb and

490
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
currently the comments which were

491
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
received during adoption are still

492
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
pending so we request authors to make an

493
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
update i see samuel in the queue please

494
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
go ahead samuel

495
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
yeah i just wanted to comment the update

496
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,679
for cdw draft i collected the feedback

497
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,360
from multiple sources and there were

498
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
some conflicting opinions

499
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
so basically i tried to bulk the

500
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
update in

501
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
you know answer to so that's that's

502
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,159
causing the delay but as as discussed

503
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,080
between the authors it uh we will change

504
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
the strategy and video update we will do

505
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,280
partial updates to at least uh

506
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
updated updates on the comments that you

507
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,720
have received during the option and

508
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
and basically to sim to

509
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
make progress faster

510
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
uh perfect uh one suggestion i i would

511
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,440
also make is like wherever uh you guys

512
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
are have not able to make a conclusion

513
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
you can put an editor's note in the

514
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
document it would be easier to track for

515
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
chairs as well as other working group

516
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,159
members on where the disagreement is and

517
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
easy to provide you inputs as well

518
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,720
yeah make sense good thanks for starting

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,679
thank you

520
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
uh next we have uh

521
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,600
path mtu this is sr path empty document

522
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,679
when we adopted this document we made a

523
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,440
decision that

524
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
a companion document in spring needs to

525
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,480
be produced and authors have produced

526
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
this they presented this in the spring

527
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
session today

528
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
as well

529
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,919
and some of the text from

530
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,919
the pcep document has now moved to

531
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,960
spring

532
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,200
and it will now be making progress in

533
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
the spring document as well so thanks

534
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
authors for tracking this and closing

535
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,000
uh one update that has happened in the

536
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
document is there is a section which now

537
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
updates rfc 5440 especially with the

538
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,799
handling of

539
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
metric pound

540
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
uh sp because uh path mq is little

541
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,679
different uh the other metrics usually

542
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
look for maximum here we have to look

543
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
for minimum so some text change had to

544
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,520
be done to allow uh sr path mq to be

545
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,240
carried inside a metric object so please

546
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
review this part and provide comments

547
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
and the authors also added a section for

548
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
multipath which is pretty good so thanks

549
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,400
for updating the documents and adding

550
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,880
more text

551
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
the ifit document which was i think our

552
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
latest document that we have adopted

553
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,840
it's also on the agenda so no point

554
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,440
discussing let's move on

555
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,159
to the adoption queue so that option

556
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,559
queue is in the wiki uh some of the

557
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
documents are listed here please give

558
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,360
feedback to the chairs if you feel some

559
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
other documents needs to be put up first

560
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
give your reasoning and we would of

561
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
course be open to reshuffling things as

562
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
and when so please be more vocal reach

563
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,480
out to us so that we can help uh make

564
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
progress in the working group

565
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
uh pretty soon and with this i think

566
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
this would be the last slide

567
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,120
uh open mic any working group status

568
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,799
related things that we want to talk

569
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,880
about otherwise we'll move to the first

570
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
presentation

571
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,440
okay thank you so let me

572
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,880
sam you

573
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,840
yes i mean i'll be giving you slight

574
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
control

575
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
you should have it now

576
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
yeah

577
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,559
so thank you then

578
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,840
hi old uh i'm samuel from cisco i'll be

579
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,600
presenting doubt about piece of

580
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
extensions for circuit style on behalf

581
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
of outdoors

582
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,400
it was presented on last ipf as well as

583
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,240
well just summarize content of this

584
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,520
draft and

585
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
updates which were done after that

586
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
develop these extending pieces to

587
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,840
satisfy requirements of connection

588
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,000
oriented transport services using

589
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
segment routing policies

590
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,880
also called also called circular style

591
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,240
as our policies

592
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
there is second route

593
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
which was presented in spring working

594
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,559
group and which was presented in pc

595
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
working group in last itef so which is

596
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,679
disturbing those requirements like state

597
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,000
bandwidth guarantee endpoint protection

598
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,480
by hope behavior and how existing

599
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,840
features

600
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,120
should be used

601
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
uh

602
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,320
existing features defined in existing

603
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,919
pset rfcs or drops this drought

604
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,120
is covering gaps in pset

605
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
for two specific requirements from the

606
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
least which i mentioned

607
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
uh more specifically path persistency

608
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,159
which means also sticking to over the

609
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,520
computed part

610
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
and not modifying it in case of various

611
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,440
triggers like topology updates

612
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
or periodical optimization and this kind

613
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,400
of stuff and for buy hope behavior which

614
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
practically means that computed pub will

615
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,919
use ideas and c6 only although i will

616
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
describe details later

617
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
so

618
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
do that introduce new dlv for blocking

619
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,159
powder computation or other optimization

620
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,080
based on various triggers

621
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,279
uh like pc topology or periodic

622
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,360
computation and we have received

623
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,960
feedback that

624
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,840
there is not many use cases

625
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,320
for such grammarity so tlv was

626
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,919
simplified by removing those flex

627
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,320
as a result tlv was also renamed to

628
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,279
follow updated content of the plv and

629
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,039
moved from lsp object to lspa

630
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,520
because we interpreted updated content

631
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,200
of the pov as lspr type build or

632
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
behavior which logically belongs into

633
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
lsprt object

634
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
there is a recent comment from peru to

635
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,039
actually move it back to the lsp object

636
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
so maybe another discussion will be

637
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
needed

638
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
but yeah that's that will be done after

639
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,440
uh after this rtf

640
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
new flags were introduced to cover uh

641
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
scenarios which are not specific to

642
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,159
circuit style policies but which

643
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,000
logically belongs to

644
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
functionality discovery in this draft or

645
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,520
b flag for allowing or blocking

646
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,919
modification of computed part

647
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
if original part is already invalidated

648
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,640
so the tlv now allows both options stick

649
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,559
to completely part even if path is

650
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,000
invalid and keep lsp in downstate or

651
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
allow

652
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,039
pad modification if lsp would be down

653
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,320
second flag

654
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,520
is for controlling it explicit uh

655
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
explicit request request from operator

656
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
for updating parties allowed

657
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
here we are talking about requests

658
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,120
coming from pc side for example some

659
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,919
sale executed on pc site any normal

660
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,159
interface request

661
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,159
received on pc site or anything like

662
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,360
that

663
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,240
one

664
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
one more additional minor qualification

665
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
was made in the draft we allowed

666
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480
modification of computed part if actual

667
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
ads and cs

668
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,360
are not changed so for example operator

669
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
will change

670
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,399
manually assigned

671
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,679
adsense it to different one uh on same

672
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
topology link then pc can still compute

673
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,760
the part or basically update the path to

674
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
to new seed which is assigned to same

675
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,039
same increasing snc

676
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
second requirement covered by this graph

677
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
is clarifying usage of existing gold

678
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,919
flag in stabilized messages and

679
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
introducing new flag for stateful pc

680
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,600
messages only minor changes were done in

681
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
india since last itf

682
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
we generalized definition of state path

683
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,440
to make it more future proof

684
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,399
for example for cases the new city type

685
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
will be introduced and

686
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,799
which which will not be defined in this

687
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,679
draft original definition specified

688
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,200
explicitly usage of ibsense assets only

689
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,760
for state hopes now we are using them

690
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
only as an example and we are quite

691
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
qualifying the pc can use only seats

692
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,799
which will be perfect to specific

693
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,279
adjacencies and we are explicitly

694
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,520
blocking usually of basic basic seats

695
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,679
even even if there is just

696
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,799
one part between two modes

697
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,760
thanks for listening and

698
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,919
any comments any questions are welcome

699
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,520
we are still discussing backward

700
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,279
compatibility handling

701
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
uh and addition of new couple and

702
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,000
potential additional new capabilities to

703
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
negotiate support for these features

704
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
and we have also

705
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,240
received some feedback after publishing

706
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,559
last version of the draft so new changes

707
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,919
will be coming

708
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
soon

709
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,279
any questions any comments i see

710
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,440
i see adrian at the queue so adrian go

711
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,679
ahead

712
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,760
hello that's it hello it's adrian um

713
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
thank you for presenting

714
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,960
um some uh

715
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,679
just looking at the recompute uh bit of

716
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,720
this

717
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
um and trying to understand and i just

718
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,880
re-skimming the draft

719
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
um

720
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
it's applying to a delegated

721
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,279
uh path yeah

722
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,000
so

723
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
that's a path that's been

724
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
established in the

725
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
um

726
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
by the pcc and then

727
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
delegated back to the pce

728
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
and saying okay pce you're now the owner

729
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,840
of this but you're not allowed to

730
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
recompute a path

731
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,760
in that case why would you delegate

732
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,880
so

733
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,279
there are multiple facts as you can see

734
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
on this slide there is for example for

735
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
slack which still allows a pc to update

736
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
the part but only if operator explicitly

737
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,720
requesting it

738
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
from pc side and also

739
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,520
there is permanent flag which basically

740
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,799
means that

741
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,960
pc can still recompute but it will

742
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
recompute only if original part is

743
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,159
invalidated

744
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,399
so basically if if

745
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,440
uh

746
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
but if there is better part then pc will

747
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,440
not

748
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
will not be allowed to to send any

749
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,880
updates for the part but if pad is

750
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,799
invalidated that it can still update the

751
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
parts to basically fix it to make sure

752
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
that policy or our speedometer will not

753
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
be animated or it will not go down

754
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,840
right and and you have a

755
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,720
i i suppose i could construct use cases

756
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
but you you've got a

757
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,159
um

758
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,320
a use case that is actually driving this

759
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,200
distinction for you

760
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
so

761
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
i mean the main use case which we

762
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
originally tried to cover by the

763
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,840
computation

764
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,279
dle

765
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,559
was

766
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,519
still keeping delegation that the pc can

767
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
can drive the

768
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
drive apart so it can still peel down

769
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
the lsp it can still uh

770
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
it can still for example uh tear down

771
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,760
one candidate part of the policy if

772
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,279
it considered that

773
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,679
that another candidate part is better

774
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,559
for some reason so the intention here

775
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,760
was just to make sure that that pc will

776
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
not change the part it will not change

777
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,679
frequently it and

778
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,679
to make sure that that the part will not

779
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,399
be updated in all of the cases but there

780
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,640
will be still some exceptions where the

781
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,519
update of the part is needed or maybe at

782
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,799
least the peer down of the of the lsp

783
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,399
can be compelled by wbc

784
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
okay thanks i hear you i'm not convinced

785
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,200
but we can think about it

786
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,720
next is andrew and while andrew is

787
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,840
walking in

788
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,600
this is the second time this comment has

789
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,840
come in and if you remember like i think

790
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,360
one of the first time when this was

791
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
presented the same comment was made that

792
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,919
why are we delegating when not

793
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
re-optimization so i think it's best to

794
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
add some text

795
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
in the in the document so that this

796
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,679
question key not doesn't keeps coming up

797
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,080
uh andrew go ahead

798
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
um yeah i figured i'd just add a

799
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,159
bit of a concrete example so

800
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,279
you know you've got your pc in the

801
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,880
network you've got your lsps you want to

802
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,240
establish them you want to establish

803
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,640
primary secondary diverse paths

804
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,960
delegate to pc pce can do all its

805
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679
computation magic to establish the path

806
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,120
and at that moment you don't want to

807
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,679
deviate from those specific resources

808
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
however under certain conditions like

809
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,880
for example bandwidth

810
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,159
pc is aware of the bandwidth

811
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,760
reservations in the network the local

812
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,840
node isn't so you might have bfd running

813
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
on the lsps everything's happy but the

814
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
pc can detect a use case where

815
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,320
well i've got you established on a path

816
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,919
i've been instructed to not move you

817
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,720
around because traffic fluctuations but

818
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
i'm allowed to tear down

819
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
so for example if your primary path is

820
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
active let's tear down the primary so

821
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
that we go through the secondary because

822
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
the secondary slows enough capacity

823
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
i figured i'd just give a concrete

824
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,440
example thanks

825
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,600
thank you andrew for a very example

826
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,879
are there any more questions

827
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,240
one thing which came up during the

828
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
spring uh presentation as well

829
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,679
was i think we need to be a little

830
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,679
careful with what content we are putting

831
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
in the spring document and what is going

832
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,120
to be in this

833
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,200
uh current document is focusing on

834
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
extensions which is very good but i

835
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
think even from the spring document

836
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,239
things which are very pcb specific where

837
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,199
we are talking about how pcc delegates

838
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,399
things to pce or more piece of specific

839
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,719
things i think could be moved to this

840
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,199
document and my suggestion would be to

841
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
keep spring document

842
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,199
as general as possible and if you want

843
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
to use psup use it as an example

844
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
but the spring document should be not

845
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
specific to pce so that in future if

846
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,199
somebody wants to do bgp work for this

847
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,280
it is pretty straightforward and the

848
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,800
document doesn't

849
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
like you know seem very pce heavy

850
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,040
so i see vision is here as well so maybe

851
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
you or christian can discuss and figure

852
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,280
out what's the best way to distribute

853
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,639
the text

854
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,839
yeah we

855
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
we can discuss that but basically even

856
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
original idea was

857
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,200
to keep the spring document or keep

858
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,680
second round as informational which is

859
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,760
describing all the technologies with all

860
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
the features which needs to be connected

861
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,119
together for the for the cs policies and

862
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,000
then this drought will basically cover

863
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
any extensions which are delivered on

864
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
top of existing droughts or existing

865
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,480
implementations uh existing rs

866
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,200
so yeah we can discuss that

867
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,760
any other separation would make sense

868
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
but

869
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,680
maybe maybe even another development

870
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
would be needed in such case to

871
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
basically split the informational part

872
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,200
which is

873
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
videos connecting all the all the

874
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,079
features together and and the extensions

875
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,800
which are needed um yeah but we can we

876
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
cannot start the discussion and we can

877
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,280
we can try to qualify if there are any

878
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,240
arguments against or or

879
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
for this specific approach which was

880
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
already taken

881
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,440
thank you

882
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,160
uh and one last point which which is i

883
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,839
think the continuation of discussion

884
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,839
that we had during the last time i do

885
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,680
not have a very strong opinion but i

886
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,160
just want the working group to be like

887
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,560
you know thinking about this and this

888
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,200
was a comment even pawan made during the

889
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,599
in the chat in the spring working group

890
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,440
where he said that should we think of

891
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,280
this as a well-known

892
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,760
path profile or a

893
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,160
policy in terms of psap or whether we

894
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,040
should think of this as a very specific

895
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,480
thing called circuit style sr policy or

896
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
should we think like if use cases like

897
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,040
this are gonna keep popping up

898
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,960
should we think of defining some

899
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,920
well-known path profiles or well-known

900
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,560
policies and then using our policy

901
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,040
framework as a way to do this or should

902
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,320
we do separate tlb separate flag as

903
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
currently being done in this document so

904
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,480
i just want a working group to think

905
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,040
about it and currently i think most of

906
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
the authors and the working group likes

907
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,920
what's there in the draft but i would

908
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,079
like us to be cognizant that

909
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,359
if this is the direction that we are

910
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,359
taking it might have an impact for us in

911
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,280
future as well

912
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
so if anybody has any thoughts on this

913
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
comments on this we have some time we

914
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,920
have a light agenda so please come and

915
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,480
let's use this time to discuss i see

916
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,040
andrew coming in

917
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
i was just going to mention something

918
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,760
that we've tried to do in this document

919
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
is try to make you know these bit flags

920
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,359
reusable in other use cases

921
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,599
so while the document is described as

922
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,599
circuit style as our policy obviously

923
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,040
the overall solution now has been moved

924
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,359
to spring um so i think from the pce

925
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,400
side

926
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
you know these flags are not necessarily

927
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
just specific to circuit styles or

928
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
policy but it kind of encompasses that

929
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
whole solution so

930
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
at the end of the day nothing's stopping

931
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
somebody from reusing these tlvs and

932
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,640
other use cases as well

933
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,640
thanks

934
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,359
i just wanted to mention that if anybody

935
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,839
else has a different opinion we are

936
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,760
discussing this opinion in the mailing

937
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,240
list as well so feel free to express the

938
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,359
opinion

939
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,400
list

940
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,280
at least then we remember correctly your

941
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
command is is discussed on the mailing

942
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,839
list right so yes

943
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
thank you

944
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
thank you

945
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,000
hi fan i'll pass on control to you

946
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,000
okay

947
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
okay and this is

948
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,960
huawei and on behalf of the other

949
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
closers i would present this pcep

950
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,399
extensions to redundancy policy

951
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
and here's some background of the

952
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
redundancy protection and redundancy

953
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,560
policy

954
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
and the redemptive protection is a

955
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,200
generalized protection mechanism that

956
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,000
used in the context of the segment

957
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
routine paradigm

958
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
and as shown in this figure and it

959
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,320
replicates the packets on the redundancy

960
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,960
node and transmits through

961
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,680
transmit the copies of the packets over

962
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,160
the multiple destroying paths

963
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,839
and on the merging node it transmits the

964
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,440
first accurate

965
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,000
and eliminate the redundant

966
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
packet

967
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
um

968
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
in

969
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,119
overall we have four um currently we

970
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
have four drafts introduced this uh

971
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,640
redundancy protection mechanism and the

972
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
first draft

973
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,480
introduced the redundancy seat and

974
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,119
redundancies redundancy segment and

975
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,800
merging segment

976
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,240
in the data plane to specify the the

977
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,079
behavior of the replication and

978
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,520
illumination

979
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,800
and second

980
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,280
second draft introduced this redundancy

981
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,800
policy

982
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
in control plane to

983
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,520
instruct the multiple fantasy forwarding

984
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,880
pass

985
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,920
from the controller to the redundancy

986
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
node

987
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
and the third

988
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
draft introduced the btp extensions to

989
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,839
advertise the redundancy policy

990
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,079
attribute

991
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,839
and

992
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,200
the last one is these this disrupted the

993
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
pcb extensions

994
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,720
uh actually it includes uh several uh

995
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,640
content and first is the is the request

996
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
first is to request the pass computation

997
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,319
and the protection method

998
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,440
from pcc to pce and also advertise the

999
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
redundancy policy

1000
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,078
attribute from pce to pcc in counterplay

1001
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
and also some background of the

1002
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,480
redundancy policy

1003
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,960
it is defined as a variant of the sr

1004
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
policy with minimum changes

1005
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,760
so it inherits the

1006
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,839
the main structure and the most of the

1007
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,520
attributes from

1008
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,200
from sr policy

1009
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,720
actually it is enhanced by uh import a

1010
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,960
new uh a new optional uh flag attribute

1011
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,520
at the candidate pass

1012
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,920
yeah they can um to the candid pass

1013
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,440
and we we think it should be uh applied

1014
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,319
for

1015
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,279
for both sr uh mpls and srv6

1016
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,760
so i summarized the pcp extensions here

1017
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,920
um first to firstly and two new tlvs of

1018
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
the request parameters object to support

1019
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,160
this

1020
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,960
to support the request of the redundancy

1021
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,440
uh pass computation and protection

1022
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,480
method

1023
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,400
and another utrv to distribute the

1024
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,880
the flag attribute of the redundancy

1025
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,359
policy from pce to pcc

1026
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,560
and the first sub tlv of these rp object

1027
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,680
is called redundancy detection trv and

1028
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,319
uh actually there are two fields um in

1029
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,480
this uh two uh two fields in this uh trv

1030
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,440
the first is the flag that we use eight

1031
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,400
bit uh bitmap to indicate the

1032
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,839
the constraint of the past computation

1033
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,720
and one flag is used um

1034
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,920
to indicate it is the redundancy

1035
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,800
computation requirement

1036
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,599
and the the second is the number

1037
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,400
is the number two to indicate how many

1038
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,599
redundancy forwarding pass

1039
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
in pcc requires

1040
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,119
and this message is and this tlb is

1041
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,839
carried from uh by the

1042
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,480
um the request and respond to

1043
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,359
um

1044
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,560
between the

1045
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,680
between the pcc and pce

1046
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,359
uh the second subtly is called the

1047
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,760
protection type trv

1048
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
we use to protect we use four bit value

1049
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,079
to indicate the protection type of the

1050
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,319
protection type of this

1051
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,520
past computation because the redundancy

1052
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
protection actually it is a protection

1053
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,960
mechanism so we think

1054
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,680
based on the previous um protection

1055
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,560
mechanisms um we actually introduced a

1056
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,520
new

1057
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,520
mechanism for the protection so it might

1058
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,599
need some um some modification to the

1059
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,400
to the

1060
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,079
2d and to define the protection type

1061
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,000
so here we introduce a new uh dlv um we

1062
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,520
i also see the

1063
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,000
there are there is uh there is there are

1064
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,040
requirements

1065
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
there are there are comments from uh

1066
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,200
from to roofie on the mainly list

1067
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
and to discuss that

1068
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,119
if we need to define a new

1069
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,640
treat or uh we need to

1070
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,760
do some research uh to the to

1071
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,119
to backwards compatible um

1072
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
to the existing implementations

1073
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,119
um i think we will discuss it uh among

1074
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,839
the coursers but right now we propose a

1075
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,079
new tsatri to

1076
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,400
to enhance the

1077
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
protection type

1078
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,280
uh the last tier we see is this um it is

1079
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,480
defined it is encoded in the

1080
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,520
uh in the sr policy association group

1081
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,160
it is called the the the candidate pass

1082
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,520
flag tlb um because as we as we just

1083
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,359
introduced in the redundancy um policy

1084
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,599
uh to one attribute one optional

1085
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,240
attribute flag is introduced to the

1086
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
candidate pass

1087
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,440
so um

1088
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,520
so in pcp that we introduce a new um

1089
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,400
kind of past black trv to carry the

1090
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,040
uh the the flag uh

1091
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,960
the flag of the of the canteen pass

1092
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
and in the

1093
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,760
in the in the current uh design of the

1094
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,040
redundancy policy only one bit of the

1095
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,040
of the flag is defined uh so that is the

1096
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
the redundancy flag so and

1097
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,960
similarly here that we use one flag one

1098
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,839
bit of the flat to differ to indicate

1099
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,040
the

1100
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,160
redundancy flag

1101
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,960
and

1102
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
here is some

1103
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,760
considerations

1104
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,200
uh so this is a zero zero elevation of

1105
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,400
the of the draft so we we are we seek

1106
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
for the uh discussions on many lists

1107
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,359
from working group and

1108
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,760
we will also keep aligned with progress

1109
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
in spring um

1110
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,839
the progress of the relentless policy

1111
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,279
discussion and thank you for listening

1112
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,760
thank you fan are there any questions

1113
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,640
uh i have couple uh maybe we can uh

1114
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,119
discuss uh the first one that i have

1115
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,040
would be uh

1116
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,280
the document that we have in the spring

1117
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,599
about the redundancy protection

1118
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,359
this one is very srv6 specific so the

1119
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,680
first thing that we would have to do is

1120
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,280
since all the other documents are saying

1121
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,760
that they will work for both sr mpls and

1122
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,560
srv6 we have to make sure that we have a

1123
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,839
mechanism for sr mpls for basic

1124
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,800
redundancy protection said

1125
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
is there any thoughts on this am i

1126
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,160
missing something is there any

1127
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,480
discussion in the spring that the pc

1128
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,240
working group is not aware of so you can

1129
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,040
maybe enlighten

1130
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,559
um initially that we would like to

1131
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,440
to

1132
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,000
to define this redundancy protection for

1133
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,359
the sr npr's and srp6

1134
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,079
um but later will be this when we

1135
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,480
discuss with because this uh this

1136
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,400
redundancy protection is triggered by

1137
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,200
the that net prey off functions

1138
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,040
so um but in that net there is already

1139
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
uh rfc discussed the

1140
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,720
uh the npr's uh data plane um at this

1141
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
the similar functions in ikea state

1142
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,040
plane so we we didn't think uh we

1143
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,079
um

1144
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,200
we haven't we haven't dabbing too into

1145
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,880
this um

1146
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,760
into the space specifications of the of

1147
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,240
the npr's data plane

1148
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,040
so

1149
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,760
i think it it it is some

1150
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,359
kind of missing

1151
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,240
there

1152
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,559
um but we will

1153
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,040
i think we'll discuss and find a better

1154
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,240
way to

1155
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,520
uh to

1156
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
to fill in the gap here

1157
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,079
and i i see

1158
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,440
thank you uh

1159
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,200
uh

1160
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,119
in the queue i think

1161
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,359
yeah yeah thank you

1162
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,240
uh

1163
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,880
ericsson i just also wanted to bring up

1164
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,599
that it's basically coming from that net

1165
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,400
the

1166
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,640
computer application elimination

1167
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,559
functions and maybe a coordination with

1168
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,520
that net might be good as well

1169
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,480
that's it thank you

1170
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,119
i think they have a document in that net

1171
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,040
is this on the agenda this time

1172
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,880
the enhanced

1173
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,720
oh this document is not oh sorry this

1174
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,359
was only in spring and bgp sorry my back

1175
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,880
anthony go ahead

1176
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,040
yeah

1177
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,200
hi anthony somerset liquid um can you

1178
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,960
just go back to the tlv slide i think

1179
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,319
the second one

1180
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,880
um is there a maps issue because it says

1181
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,280
reserves 24 bits but the diagram says

1182
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,160
there's

1183
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,680
uh the next one

1184
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,079
um the diagram's saying that there's 28

1185
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,720
bits reserved

1186
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,559
just to knit for the maps

1187
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,839
oh

1188
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,040
i think just

1189
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,800
i think it's a temple sorry

1190
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,440
so

1191
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,160
some other points that we also want to

1192
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,839
discuss something that we started on the

1193
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,079
mailing list as well which is further

1194
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,480
discussion on whether we should use rp

1195
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,520
object

1196
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,800
or try to put this inside sr policy i

1197
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,359
think let's continue that discussion

1198
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,920
and of course with protection you use

1199
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,760
the wood that

1200
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,160
this is little different protection than

1201
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,480
what is already defined in psep so it

1202
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,839
would be good to

1203
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,839
tell what do you really mean by that

1204
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,280
what what is the difference between

1205
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,200
redundancy protection and maybe the

1206
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,760
diversity work or protection type that

1207
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,400
we already have in psep so if you need

1208
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,319
to define something new just be very

1209
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,960
clear on how it is different from what

1210
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,200
is already there and how it will work

1211
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,079
with

1212
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,920
what is already defined that if somebody

1213
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,640
encodes both of these how would how

1214
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,559
would how would it interact with each

1215
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,800
other so you need to be more careful uh

1216
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,640
at the time of introducing especially

1217
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,359
for the protection

1218
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,359
okay thank you for uh for the

1219
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,000
suggestions um yeah we'll have some

1220
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,160
internal discussions with the coursers

1221
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
and come back with uh

1222
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,680
uh with the

1223
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
yeah with the answers yeah thank you

1224
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,279
perfect thank you

1225
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,280
let me give you slight control

1226
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,520
you should have enough

1227
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,800
okay hello everyone

1228
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,160
uh i would like to do the meditation

1229
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,160
about pcep extensive state verification

1230
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,200
for srps on behalf of all authors

1231
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,680
what's about the latest versions

1232
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,119
uh we update our draft based on the

1233
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,480
comments from adobe and join thank you

1234
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,680
very much

1235
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,680
and we use reflect instead of attended

1236
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,319
with like and remove equal one the

1237
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,920
format of the siero sub object

1238
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,359
and i'd say the verification process and

1239
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,160
i use a two 2pd

1240
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,800
code point for repeat

1241
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,280
section

1242
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,599
this page is for

1243
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,440
motor business uh draft itf's principal

1244
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,640
road policy describes the state

1245
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,599
verification build usage uh seed

1246
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,839
verification is performed

1247
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,640
when the hard end is explicitly

1248
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,920
requested to verify state by the

1249
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,440
controllers while the signaling protocol

1250
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,640
used and

1251
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,760
fc8664 specifies extensions to the pcep

1252
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,200
that allow a stateful pce to compute and

1253
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,359
initiate t pass as well as a pcc to

1254
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,240
request a past subject to slaughtering

1255
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,359
constraints and optimization criteria in

1256
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,359
isr networks

1257
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,960
and this draft defines a new flag for

1258
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,119
indicating the height and

1259
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,960
is explicitly requested to verify seat

1260
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,680
by the pce

1261
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,640
and this is for seed verification flying

1262
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,079
in this document we defined with like in

1263
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,280
sr ero subject for indicating the pcc is

1264
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,440
explicitly requested to verify state by

1265
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,920
the pc's e and we also defined with like

1266
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,839
a

1267
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,480
sro sub object and the format of the sr

1268
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,280
sub object is the same as that of the

1269
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,720
sro sub object but without

1270
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,680
flag

1271
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,520
as defined in fc86

1272
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,880
the reflect has no meaning in the srro

1273
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,440
and is ignored as we see it and the pce

1274
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,720
next is

1275
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,680
the state verification process

1276
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,960
process

1277
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,319
i was receiving i i saw yeah i saw v6

1278
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,880
yahoo with the flag inside

1279
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,040
uh

1280
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,680
sorry this is uh

1281
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,440
on receiving i saw yao with the reflect

1282
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,680
inside a pcc must verify seat if a pcc

1283
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,480
uh verification fails forward seat it

1284
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,079
must report this arrow by including the

1285
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,480
srp iron code tlv without spiro value

1286
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,520
state

1287
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,640
verification fields in the iosp object

1288
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,160
in the pc report mouse message to the

1289
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,799
pce

1290
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
and under the uh

1291
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,200
and the uh under the i uh comments we

1292
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,480
occur and uh and the ieti

1293
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,200
one was there was meetings

1294
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,799
we discussed uh why the uh the policeman

1295
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,880
of the rebate uh is appropriate

1296
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,960
pro 88 and

1297
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,680
this draft aligned with the extension of

1298
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,160
draft pc e srv6 and dropped bdps are

1299
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,119
polls

1300
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,160
so

1301
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,480
we extend a new flag as a young object

1302
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,920
and we have accepted all the comments

1303
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,599
from

1304
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,400
from

1305
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,520
the mail list and how updated the draft

1306
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,680
this draft is very simple but i think

1307
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,839
it's very useful

1308
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,280
so

1309
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,880
we all think our draft is ready for call

1310
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,240
of a

1311
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,040
call for adoption so we always request

1312
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,839
that the tears to consider to call for

1313
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:26,880
adopts

1314
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,599
that's how i think

1315
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,240
are there any comments

1316
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,558
samuel go ahead

1317
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,160
i just wanted to support that adoption

1318
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,559
basically the drought is introducing or

1319
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,839
useful stuff

1320
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,520
which which is already covered in the

1321
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,079
drought so if there were no further

1322
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,480
changing of other comments from the

1323
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,160
working group

1324
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,640
for any major modifications so

1325
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,920
um

1326
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,160
yeah

1327
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,520
i i just wanted to support it

1328
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,160
thank you samuel

1329
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,079
anyone else

1330
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,359
uh i just wanted to plug in uh this new

1331
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,920
wiki page that i have created uh it is

1332
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,040
still work in progress but uh like this

1333
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,520
document was something that got missed

1334
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,400
uh in pce one fun flag and now we have

1335
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,319
to update the document to add that flag

1336
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,440
in psep similarly we have algo confusion

1337
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,599
so we need to do a little better job

1338
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
with coordinating between our documents

1339
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,680
so we have started this page that can

1340
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,799
help

1341
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,960
i put the link in the chat

1342
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,040
where we would request the authors when

1343
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,960
they are working on multiple documents

1344
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,160
in bgp in spring in it they can update

1345
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,559
this wiki and we can like you know as a

1346
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,640
working group track all of this in a

1347
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,359
much better way so that we can avoid uh

1348
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,559
these issues like one bit uh not being

1349
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,559
present in psep etc so let's try to do

1350
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,400
better job as a working group all of us

1351
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,720
together

1352
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
i still don't see

1353
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,440
i still don't see anyone in the queue

1354
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,119
uh

1355
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,200
okay working group is there any other

1356
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,280
business that one somebody would big up

1357
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,440
