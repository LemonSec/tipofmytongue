1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
that's why i wear sandals

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
that's why i wear sandals

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
and a skirt but i guess that's not

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
really an option but um

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,880
could be

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,920
as if i don't

7
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,919
so we need a volunteer note taker

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
my normal suspect is probably running

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,079
his own meeting

10
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
who was that

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
that was me aaron gable

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,400
oh there you go

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,799
we'll take it

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
um i've

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
put the agenda in it you can just plop

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
the notes wherever you want in that mess

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,040
we'll fix it

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,759
all right you think we can go y'all

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
every time we try to

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
unmute myself

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,880
the

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
mitako warns me that i'm local and that

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
it might be causing the feedback

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
okay

25
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
welcome all to the acme meeting at ipf

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
114

27
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,040
see that only i'm wearing an acme shirt

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
right

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
but let's get on with it so this is a

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
notewheel

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
i'm sure you've all seen it plenty of

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
times

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
so we'll not

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
dwell on that too much

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
specifically for itf 114

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
in-person participants make sure to sign

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,959
the session using the meet echo you take

38
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,239
a light that's

39
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
easy to do by scanning the qr code at

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
the

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
door

42
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,560
and use mitecho to join the my

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
microphone queue

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,239
and keep audio and video off if you're

45
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
not using on-site version

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
and wear masks unless you're actively

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
splitting at the microphone

48
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
and this is something regardless of how

49
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,400
we feel about it this is something we

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
all agreed when we signed up for this

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
meeting so

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,959
wear your masks

53
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,959
and make sure audio and video are off

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
unless you're sharing or presenting and

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,400
use the headset is strongly recommended

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
for remote participants yeah like i am

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
okay

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
so

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,518
agenda got the metacall

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
so this is our own specific agenda we'll

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,360
do the note well already done

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
technical difficulties we so far haven't

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
needed to

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
do that and then you miss trivia

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
we already got to note taker

66
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
and we'll do the document status then

67
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
we'll talk about uh current work items

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
which are

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,560
um detailing node id and

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
ari which is not really a current torque

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
item because we haven't adopted it yet

72
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,120
but we'll talk about that as well

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
and then

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
there's potential new work from brandon

75
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
weeks

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
and the agenda bashing before we

77
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,799
continue

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
good

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
so

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
document status we don't have any new

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
rfcs since vienna

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
um acme authority token

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
has a discuss from ben k deck since

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
november of

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
2021

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
new version zero eight from this month

87
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
and what do we do then kadak is no

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,760
longer an ad

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,399
do you want to do that one and the one

90
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,120
on the next slide at the same time

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
john's here

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,599
all right

93
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
so

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,240
okay acme client we have a new version

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
zero five from april

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
very light discussion on the mailing

97
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
list and that's

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
kind of par for the course

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
and then we have um

100
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
tnothlist current version is from

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
26th of march 2021 which i think is

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
right from vienna

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
there are three outstanding discusses

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
and revised id needed

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
and

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
so sorry

107
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
march 2021 which is over a year before

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
vienna

109
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
and

110
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
then dtn node id is current version is

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
from just before itf 113

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,199
waiting for write-up external parties

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,000
since march of 2022 and we have a

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
presentation today

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
yes so we have john we have john at the

116
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
mic

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
how's it going yeah so we did try at

118
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,039
least to deal with the discuss on the

119
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
first of these documents on the the

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,639
original authority token doc i know we

121
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
have not gotten to the token t not list

122
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,479
i'm not actually the editor of that one

123
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
but like hopefully with this new zero

124
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,199
eight version it's like better um

125
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,960
i tried to fix what seemed to be the

126
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
major discusses that were out there and

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
even to address the majority of ben's

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
comments

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
so we still have work to do obviously on

130
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,880
tnoth list and you know ben it's a very

131
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
thorough reader we have like a ton to

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
say about that doc that we need to get

133
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
to and i will help the editors uh the

134
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
editor of that to get that done

135
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
so can i ask you who the editor of that

136
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
is i think it's either chris or mary i'm

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
not actually sure who last had the xml

138
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,720
for it but yeah chris or mary all right

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
so we know who to chase now for that one

140
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
yeah um because it's not you

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
well i mean i can obviously do some work

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
but i need like the source yeah yeah you

143
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
know it was i mean it's really uh

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
honestly it's probably more responding

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,840
to ben's mail in particular that is the

146
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,039
long pole in that tent because there's

147
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,560
just a ton

148
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
there's a ton of comments honestly when

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
i looked at it some of it does spill

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
over between the documents even a bit so

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,080
like yeah there's there's actual work

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
that needs to be done it's hard to get

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
people to do actual work is it worth

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
bringing this the document that you or

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
the editor for back into the working

156
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
group to get it reviewed because we

157
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
don't have ben anymore

158
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,639
um i mean i think the authority token

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
document should be cool like in terms of

160
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,080
what the

161
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
it's the other ones the tnothlest one

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
right you know if if we're in trouble

163
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,680
i don't know if we need to bring it back

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
to the working group and honestly it

165
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
just is a matter of getting the cycles

166
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,360
to do it

167
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
and like definitely a revised idea is

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
needed there's there's no no but

169
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
somebody needs to review the updated 08

170
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
version right

171
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,319
it's true i mean i assume the isg would

172
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
review it at this point

173
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
or

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
yeah like in theory paul hoffman

175
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,280
inherited these discusses but um

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
yeah so

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
a couple of observations first i think

178
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,319
that

179
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
i would be reticent to bring

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
to do a different progression on the

181
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
documents separately they're clearly you

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
know intertwined and if something comes

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
up and we advance one too far forward

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,319
we're going to be in a pickle so i want

185
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
to move them in in lockstep so even if

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
we clear on the other one and we haven't

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
cleared on this one like i'd want to

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
hold it so i think part of it is i would

189
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
need to revisit where we are but it

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
looked like substantial changes were

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
needed on the tf office based on based

192
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
on the feedback so typically what we do

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
when we have substantial changes we want

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
to reconfirm consensus on the solution

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
so what we don't want to do is reiterate

196
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
in the isg because we still need to

197
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
check with the working group that

198
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
they're good with the big changes and

199
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
then there's a judgment call there

200
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
whether we got to go back to the

201
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,800
community so my recommendation would be

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
given that we're anticipating big

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,919
changes on that the easiest way to do

204
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,680
the consensus check and have a formal

205
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
process to know where we are where we

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
are instead of you know doing this kind

207
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
of side consultation would be to bring

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,240
it back to the working

209
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
i mean sure obviously the working group

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,479
should read it i think we want to bring

211
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,679
the attention working group to the

212
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,958
changes that have already been made to

213
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
the authority token document and ask if

214
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
everyone here is cool with what's in the

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
zero eight of that

216
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,640
i think that is something that's

217
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
probably worth doing at this point

218
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
i i definitely agree we should move

219
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,839
these together that it doesn't make

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,279
sense to advance the authority token

221
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,839
document without tnothlist or vice versa

222
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,000
and so i guess

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
you know the question is do we want to

224
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
start that process of just sending the

225
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
list and saying like hey is everybody's

226
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
still cool with what's an authority

227
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
token now as of zero eight

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
like or do we want to wait until

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,120
tenochlis is also iterated and then ask

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,399
the working group are both of those

231
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,200
documents jointly cool but we i think

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
that kind of can occur in parallel with

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
the ihg's ongoing review that's right i

234
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
what i don't want is for these things to

235
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
literally be like you know go through a

236
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,800
new pub wrath and a new like you know

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
gen art and everything when they've

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
already been to the isg

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
well we actually do that all the time uh

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
and i stare at it i guess um i i just

241
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
don't know where the energy is so we're

242
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,839
15 months from the last version of that

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,839
document

244
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,880
so that gives me great applause i guess

245
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
and given that i didn't hear kind of

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
firm dates we're gonna we're committed

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
to

248
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
to hammering it kind of here you know at

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
a particular time we are we sure about

250
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
the editors we're not like maybe we'll

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
track them down i'm concerned that we

252
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,320
can close it it's been 15 months

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
and that's the consensus check on

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
primarily after i mean when it's been 15

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
months since we did it we have big kind

256
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,560
of problems uh i i mean i'm kind of

257
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
what i was hoping here is a lot of

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,279
energy to kind of move forward because

259
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
my gut is i'm not sure and that's why i

260
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,480
want to bring it back

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
so why don't i take an action to go back

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
to the tnoth list authors and find out

263
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
who the editor is who has the pen who

264
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,200
has the pen and and give them and make

265
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
them tell me how long it's going to take

266
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,760
them for them to

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
update the document once they update the

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
document and reissue right then we drop

269
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
them back down to the working group for

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
a short period of time just to review

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
them both in parallel

272
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,519
and at that point we pop them if they're

273
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
fine we just ship them up and and we're

274
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
done right

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,200
because we should clear the discussions

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
on tn off and there are no there's

277
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,920
nothing to clear on the other document

278
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
the one that has all the ben comments on

279
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
it yeah and so there's like one

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,079
francesca thing or something that there

281
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
is something from francesca but i don't

282
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
remember what document that's on yeah on

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,839
the token authority well she's not

284
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
reviewing anything

285
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
because

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
yeah in terms of process

287
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
just to make sure we have the names

288
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
right uh the others are comments uh

289
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
these are the blocking discusses and

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
paul did uh take up ben's position so

291
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
paul can help us

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
right

293
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,720
this results yeah uh mister

294
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
well you know yeah right uh former chair

295
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,959
uh sorry deb um president

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
the tn stuff was

297
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
def came to you know

298
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,839
hope john correct me if i got a

299
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,760
character if my memory is faulty but it

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
came from the stir stuff and it wasn't

301
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
really

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
i mean the domain expertise is for the

303
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
most part over there right so if it

304
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,959
landed for more than a year um it was

305
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,120
probably not

306
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
purely the working acme working groups

307
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
issue or concern and they might have

308
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
fallen through the cracks because some

309
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
of the people got

310
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
busy and other stuff in stir i mean i'm

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
happy to involve stir if we need to

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,839
involve stir like i don't think that's a

313
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
problem right

314
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
john again i won't put myself back in

315
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
the queue but yeah i mean part of the

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
issue is right that we ended up using

317
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
some of this but not all of it in the

318
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
way that we practically do certificate

319
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
issuing here in the united states right

320
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
first or shaken and like so yes and

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
searching has become this whole thing

322
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,399
it's like really huge and we're all

323
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
super busy with it and so this this was

324
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
is not front burner because we we need

325
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
the token format and that's already

326
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,279
written into some like addis documents

327
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
under standards bodies things like it

328
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
but we haven't seen a lot of uptake on

329
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,120
actually using acne for this bluntly no

330
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
i i'm not thrilled about that in the

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
sense of we have like a short lived

332
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
certificate story that we're building

333
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
for stir that really should rely on acme

334
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
for it to work and it would be a shame

335
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,600
if we can't get that to work because

336
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
it's one of the best solutions that you

337
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
know we could really have to some of the

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
more difficult

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
um non-carrier stir shaken cases

340
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,920
so it's like yeah because that the

341
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
energy around it is sporadic right like

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
i mean i'm not gonna you know try to

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
sweep that under the rug it hasn't been

344
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
critical path for us to get this done

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
but

346
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
you know in light of some more recent

347
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
things that has injected some energy

348
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
back into it especially because of the

349
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
potential for doing short-lived which we

350
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
need for something that i know chris

351
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
feels pretty strongly about and i mean

352
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,160
if you put me on the spot i'm pretty

353
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,079
sure chris is the one that is supposed

354
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
to or at least has the latest version of

355
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,920
the source for this tnothless document

356
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
so like i believe the energy exists to

357
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,639
do it

358
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
um again i can't i don't think i can

359
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,920
make promises for when but like

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
you know that's the situation so i mean

361
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,279
we're happy to do the right thing for

362
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,320
the

363
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
for the situation right we just need to

364
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
we need to get it going

365
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
we need to get it going and that that's

366
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
how i summoned the energy to do the

367
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
document that i did right because i see

368
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,279
this coming down the pike and i'm like

369
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
okay this gotta get done and i had

370
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
cycles to do that but not to intervene

371
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
on this and do this one too

372
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,720
and like if necessary i'll do this one

373
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
too right at the end of the day

374
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
um

375
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
we could share the load to somebody else

376
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,959
i mean there's like four authors on all

377
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,639
these things and there's like no reason

378
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
for one person to be doing all the work

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
i know

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
so all right so let's let's stick with

381
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
unless sean's got a comment because

382
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,680
sean's at the mic

383
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
hello sean turner i will volunteer to

384
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,399
review these drafts when you rest the

385
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
xml from chris's hands and get it fixed

386
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
oh you're the best

387
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
so i think the plan is to to contact the

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,440
authors of tnoth and find out or

389
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
whatever we're calling that thing

390
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
um figure out when we can get an update

391
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
to that we'll bring them all both of

392
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
them back to the working group for a

393
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
two-week last call

394
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
and we'll review it

395
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
with the

396
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
number of reviewers that we normally get

397
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
in this working group

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
um

399
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
which is

400
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
three

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
possibly more than the number of authors

402
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,959
of the document but i wouldn't count on

403
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
that there's like four or five of those

404
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,040
and then um push it back up again

405
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
do you agree

406
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,560
i'm looking at you off he doesn't know

407
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,439
i'm looking at him though

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,079
what do you think yeah that sounds good

409
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,199
enough i mean one outcome is that the

410
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
group has lost interest interest and we

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
buried the documents i mean that's also

412
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,760
a possible outcome if really there's no

413
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
energy to write them i mean

414
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
if this was really important for people

415
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,959
then

416
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
the original office not having energy

417
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,120
would mean that somebody else takes the

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,079
pen

419
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,839
i don't see anybody else rushing to take

420
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
the pen either so

421
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,959
um well

422
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
i guess it all depends on the current

423
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
authors getting uh

424
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,160
getting the energy to

425
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
uh revise when we make that

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,680
when we make that working glute last

427
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
call we'll cc stir too

428
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,759
while we're at it because that might get

429
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,759
us a few more reviews

430
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,120
right okay

431
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
does that sound like a plan

432
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
yeah okay

433
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,279
good because we'd like to get this done

434
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
right it needs to be

435
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,160
yeah right it doesn't you don't need

436
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,279
hanging over your head for the rest of

437
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,759
your life right

438
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,880
just saying

439
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
okay

440
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
so um

441
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
two more things uh integrations went

442
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
through working group last call not a

443
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
lot of discussion uh question is are we

444
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
ready to go ahead and sub domains just

445
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
finished uh working with last call

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,800
i think integration's had a handful of

447
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,320
reviews

448
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,880
um it's got some tie-ups with lamps

449
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
in that there's a

450
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,720
is my purchase in here no

451
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,600
oh look at that um

452
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,759
he's got a draft in lamps that needs to

453
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,160
get adopted

454
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,839
but i mean i guess that's

455
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,959
not our problem right

456
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
right

457
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
okay so i say we push both of those

458
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
okay

459
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
and okay and then there was ari which we

460
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
um

461
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
had a

462
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
adoption call

463
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,160
and well when it was presented in vienna

464
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,720
and uh the previous uh

465
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
meeting uh there was a lot of enthusiasm

466
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
in the room a virtual room at least

467
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,720
and

468
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
then we called for adoption and uh

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
heard pretty much nothing from on the

470
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,119
mailing list

471
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
so

472
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
yeah how do we deal with that well

473
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
anyway we do have a presentation so

474
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,959
we might uh want to

475
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,720
delay the

476
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,520
that discussion until

477
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,559
today's presentation

478
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,640
okay and

479
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
with that

480
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,320
it's time for acme detail nowadays

481
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
right

482
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
so there's brian

483
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
yes hello oh you get this already

484
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
we can hear you i mean you're just going

485
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
to drive your sleds for you

486
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,039
okay

487
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
all two of them

488
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
very short yes

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
uh so go ahead to the

490
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,120
next the real slide yeah yeah

491
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,000
uh

492
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
so

493
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
the good news is that there has not been

494
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
any further changes

495
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
since the last ietf these are really the

496
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
same notes as before summarizing the

497
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,039
last changes in the document

498
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
the bad

499
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
news is that there hasn't been any

500
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
feedback or real

501
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
progress so far on this

502
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,280
um

503
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,000
the

504
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,039
uh

505
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,080
the cose document is still in in off 48

506
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,480
which isn't a huge hold up um and the i

507
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
don't have it on this slide but the the

508
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
corresponding

509
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
dtn document to add a missing iana

510
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
registry that's needed here

511
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
um

512
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
is still

513
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
being requested for working group

514
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
adoption but it's also not a

515
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
controversial thing

516
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,919
uh any other working group

517
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,760
so if you go to the next slide

518
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,919
there is no next slide oh i'm sorry

519
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,640
well

520
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
uh

521
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
the

522
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,520
the last uh ietf uh ended up with this

523
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
uh requesting

524
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
uh a last call since

525
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,960
there were

526
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,039
changes in function changes in on the

527
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
wire encoding on

528
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,080
on this behavior

529
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
for the uh

530
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,640
the um algorithm agility

531
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
uh

532
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
but i have not seen anything since then

533
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
so we asked for a last call right

534
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,559
are we asked for a review what are we

535
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
doing here

536
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
roman

537
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,559
yeah i'm just pulling up the way i

538
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
yeah so we went to itf last call a bunch

539
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,520
of

540
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
things were kind of requested we made

541
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
breaking changes in the protocol and i

542
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,679
think the call on the list was can we

543
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,160
confirm that people put eyes on those

544
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
changes and we're good to go it's i

545
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
think it's like a consensus recheck

546
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
question because adam last call we did

547
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
to make breaking changes like separating

548
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
separating the bundle

549
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
so i think what would help us here is a

550
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
couple eyes on it and say

551
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
we're all okay with it and i will give

552
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
it another look and then we can ship it

553
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
and the main actual benefit of these

554
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
last changes was to bring this behavior

555
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
more into conformance

556
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
with the rfc 8823 behavior so so this

557
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,679
behavior

558
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,880
logically

559
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
um is

560
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
that same workflow

561
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
for those that don't the roman did it

562
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
for those that don't track

563
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,799
rfc numbers it's the email challenge to

564
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
make it more consistent

565
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
okay

566
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,679
any comments

567
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
in person we need reviewers

568
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,360
we always need reviewers

569
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
okay yes aaron

570
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,679
i know that i'm one of the commenters

571
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,360
who requested

572
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
the changes to bring it more in line

573
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
with the email validation and i'm 99

574
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,159
sure that i've looked at it again since

575
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
then and it looked good but i will make

576
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,000
sure that i take another look at it and

577
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
send an email to the list as

578
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
thank you thank you

579
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
okay i don't have anything further then

580
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
okay so we'll reiterate the request for

581
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,640
review

582
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,919
and

583
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,200
look and see how many reviews you

584
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
already had i think you had a couple

585
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,840
right

586
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
um

587
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
and we'll see if we can't push this

588
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
along

589
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,840
great thank

590
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,360
you thank you

591
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
okay aaron

592
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
uh

593
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,520
yeah next slide

594
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
um not a

595
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,159
yeah hi aaron gable uh

596
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,919
this is the re ari uh acme revocation

597
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,039
information draft uh it is currently at

598
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,880
version zero three

599
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
uh so one new version since last acme uh

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,559
next slide

601
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,320
um

602
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,919
most of the changes here are pretty

603
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,159
small a few people spotted some minor

604
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
typos and we got those cleaned up uh

605
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,760
there's some good discussion on the

606
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
mailing list about

607
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,000
why other solutions aren't

608
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
viable solutions to the set of problems

609
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,480
that this draft solves and so i updated

610
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,559
some of the text in the introduction to

611
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,720
better address those questions

612
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,960
uh and

613
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
clarified the suggested renewal

614
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,600
algorithm uh next slide

615
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
so this is just the one thing that is

616
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,880
like actually slightly substantive uh

617
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,720
the there's text in the draft that

618
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
describes

619
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,400
what a client should do with the

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,159
information about its requested renewal

621
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
window uh and previously it was phrased

622
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
that the client

623
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
must perform a specific set of

624
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,720
calculations and then simply

625
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,760
should renew at the time resulting from

626
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
that set of calculations and some people

627
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
i think rightfully pointed out that

628
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
that's a kind of weird way to phrase it

629
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,840
and so instead i've changed it to

630
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,960
exactly the text that is on this slide

631
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
which is that they

632
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,919
must attempt renewal at a time based on

633
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,080
the suggested window

634
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
and we really recommend a specific

635
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,440
algorithm for determining a time within

636
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
that window

637
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
um

638
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,520
obviously i would like people to take a

639
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
look at this slightly changed text

640
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
provide feedback about it uh let me know

641
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,799
if it makes sense if it seems like a

642
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,720
reasonable way to standardize this etc

643
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,640
but i think all of that will be part of

644
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
just the the current round of document

645
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,559
review

646
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,520
um next slide

647
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,279
um yeah so next steps uh

648
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
i just slightly updated the draft so i

649
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
need to go back and update the current

650
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
implementation uh to match the the very

651
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
latest version but that's

652
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,039
not hard at this point

653
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,080
um

654
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
and

655
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,279
after the last ietf

656
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,080
deb sent out an email

657
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
asking for

658
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,400
a call for adoption review and feedback

659
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
and support for call for adoption there

660
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
was

661
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,279
a small amount of discussion on the list

662
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
uh and i have addressed all of the

663
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
feedback received from that discussion

664
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
so far uh but i think the next big step

665
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
is

666
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
whatever the chairs want to do with the

667
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
discussion that's happened so far

668
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,120
that's all i've got

669
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
so i think we need more review on this

670
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
right when it does need when we ask for

671
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,400
the call for adoption we need people to

672
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,679
pop up and say whether they think it

673
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,919
should be adoption adopted or not

674
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
um so i think we're going to redo the

675
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
call for adoption again and hopefully

676
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
we'll get more people popping up and

677
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,320
saying yeah we want this um

678
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,240
um

679
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
we had a bunch of people saying they

680
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,679
thought this was worthy of adoption and

681
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,200
when we made the call on the list there

682
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
was like crickets

683
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,400
yeah i think there was made one of the

684
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,679
polls here i'm sure we would get uh like

685
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,480
uh

686
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
10 people or

687
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
20 people saying yeah we should adopt

688
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,440
this but then when you ask them the list

689
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,120
nothing

690
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
right

691
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,320
i mean to be frank

692
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840
20 people on anything on this working

693
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,520
group so

694
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
i would be happy for five

695
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,000
honestly and there's 30 people in the

696
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
room

697
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,720
i

698
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
really

699
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,080
yeah

700
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,480
there is currently uh support for

701
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
adoption from two people uh melinda

702
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,760
shore and peter thomason

703
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,640
um and that's that's it on the list so

704
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,520
far

705
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
yeah

706
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,039
all right

707
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,559
all right so we'll remake that call for

708
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
adoption hopefully we'll

709
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,679
get a little more pick up this time

710
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,039
since all the people in the room have

711
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,400
heard now that we're going to ask for

712
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
adoption mr saltz

713
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
saying what we're saying is that uh

714
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
don't assume that just because you said

715
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
uh yeah let's adapt it to the meeting

716
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
that it applies to the formal call for

717
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,520
adoption

718
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,120
yes rich

719
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,039
yeah you could call for adoption here in

720
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
the room and then post on the list if

721
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
anyone objects

722
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,600
can we do it that way yeah

723
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
yeah

724
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
that way

725
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
so do you think we should adopt this

726
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
draft well

727
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,480
yes

728
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
do we raise hands or do we do a fancy

729
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
little vote thing you do the fancy thing

730
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
yeah i found

731
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
a show off hands too

732
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,360
let me

733
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
did you say to do a fancy tool a fancy

734
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,799
little thing oh look at that

735
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,440
okay because these polls don't appear in

736
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,840
the youtube recording uh

737
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
we're running a poll now that says

738
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
should we adopt ari

739
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,960
and so far we've had well

740
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
i'll wait for the final results which

741
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
declare i guess there's nobody voting

742
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
against it

743
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
yeah

744
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
okay so we have more voting for it than

745
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
we've had emails

746
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,440
yeah so you've had 17 people raise their

747
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,159
hand indicating that we should adopt ari

748
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,880
and

749
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,399
zero

750
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,240
not raising their hand

751
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
actively not raising their head which

752
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
means that we should not trace so it's

753
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,840
17-0 for adopting

754
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,760
ari right so as rich said i mean just go

755
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,679
to the mailing list and say are there

756
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,440
any objections given what looked like

757
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
consensus from this meeting and i can

758
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
give them a week or two weeks and let it

759
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,559
roll okay cool that's

760
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
easier because apparently it's easier to

761
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,559
do it in the room than it is to do it on

762
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,000
the left

763
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,960
cool

764
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,320
all right there is a reason why we're

765
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,120
having these meetings

766
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
well yeah okay

767
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,440
yeah

768
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,399
okay so thank you aaron

769
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,440
any other comment

770
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
okay so

771
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
let's go on to

772
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,640
the new proposed stuff

773
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
yes brandon

774
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,760
so you can come up and stand on the

775
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,240
little pink

776
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,679
and you if you want to take off your

777
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
mask

778
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
so it's up to you whatever you want to

779
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
do

780
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
you probably have to be near the

781
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,039
microphone though well everyone i'm

782
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,840
brandon weeks i'm from google uh just to

783
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,960
clarify

784
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
uh i'm on our security team and

785
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,799
specifically our corporate security team

786
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
so i do not represent any products

787
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,120
whatsoever i have no influence over

788
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,360
product direction

789
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,720
next slide please

790
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,200
uh tldr why am i here um

791
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,880
this is a specification and it's

792
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
relatively simple that combines the web

793
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,399
authentication statement format which is

794
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,960
effectively a key value pair where the

795
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,399
key is

796
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
a attestation format that it exists in a

797
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,039
registry and

798
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,159
the value is a

799
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,960
format specific uh series of bytes

800
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,399
with acme

801
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,760
um

802
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
the reason i care about this is this

803
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
seems like an ideal way to issue client

804
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
certificates

805
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,799
for

806
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
primarily things like laptops

807
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
workstations and servers but i don't

808
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
think there's any reason

809
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
that the specifications necessarily be

810
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,840
restricted to that

811
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,080
i can someone could come up with a use

812
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,600
case where you want to connect to the

813
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,879
same server every time

814
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,760
and for reasons that become clear in a

815
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
later slide i'd like to call for

816
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,960
adoption at this meeting if possible

817
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,360
next slide please

818
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,640
so

819
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,159
why acme

820
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,559
uh there's numerous uh certificate

821
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,679
enrollment pro uh protocols um most of

822
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,120
them are ietf specs however skep remains

823
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,919
the standard for

824
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
operating system vendors

825
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
device management vendors

826
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
cmp est

827
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
cmc all of those specifications haven't

828
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
really seen any adoption

829
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
from operating system vendors while they

830
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
might be adopted in networking gear

831
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,799
um

832
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,600
i don't know exactly why but

833
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
they're most of them predate my

834
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,600
professional career and we've seen no

835
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,959
real adoption of them

836
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
acme is incredibly well designed i'd

837
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,159
like to say thank you to the authors

838
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,480
this draft doesn't even really extend it

839
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,200
that much because all of the

840
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
extension hooks were pre-envisioned by

841
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
the authors so it was relatively simple

842
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,679
to combine these

843
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
and acme has is really well supported

844
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
across languages across platforms

845
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
i don't believe that to be true for

846
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
cmp est et cetera it's kind of hard to

847
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,559
implement those in newer languages

848
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,679
or

849
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,440
depending on the libraries that you're

850
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
allowed to use at your uh

851
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
in your environment

852
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,600
next slide please

853
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,600
so

854
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,440
what makes this a good time to do this

855
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
um

856
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,399
this is

857
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
probably the first time we can say that

858
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
most of the devices that are purchased

859
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
and deployed at least in enterprise

860
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,799
environments actually have a way to do

861
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
a device identity at the station and the

862
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,559
device can

863
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,080
identify itself and speak for itself

864
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,559
without users so

865
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,440
on android we've had android kia station

866
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,840
since

867
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,799
7.0 which is i think over five years old

868
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
um apple introduced managed device out

869
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,480
to station um this wwdc so

870
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,279
on ios so that's kind of

871
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
the major platform that has been

872
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
blocking this from being ubiquitous

873
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
it's not available on macos yet but

874
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,760
hopefully it is some day

875
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,279
someday soon

876
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
chrome os has this

877
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,440
the rats eat specification

878
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
is attempting to

879
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,880
build a standardized way of doing

880
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,159
attestation uh statements that doesn't

881
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
involve having uh four different five

882
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,440
different uh specifications um

883
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
and i would one day like to include that

884
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
but

885
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,399
today we have the formats that we have

886
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,960
um and tpms is probably the most well

887
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,720
known um

888
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,039
and this is uh what's mostly used on

889
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,480
linux windows and

890
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
other operating systems that don't have

891
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,120
proprietary attestation schemes

892
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,840
next slide please

893
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:20,799
um

894
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,600
so

895
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,840
web authent is already got mindshare as

896
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
seemingly the de facto format for

897
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,919
encapsulating and abstracting

898
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,919
uh different attestation formats across

899
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,120
vendors

900
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,840
apple already adopted it in their

901
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,000
uh apotest which is their anonymous

902
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,519
attestation that is provided to app

903
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,559
developers

904
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,360
um

905
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
and they've since adopted for their

906
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
managed device at a station feature that

907
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,080
is their non-anonymous feature for

908
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,880
managed enterprise devices

909
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,039
i've discovered this week that there's

910
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,799
two other ietf drafts that were

911
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,360
presented at 114 that also made

912
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,279
independent decisions to use the same

913
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,000
format um there's one for including

914
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,640
attestation formats in tls

915
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,399
and there was another four

916
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,480
uh essentially back porting this to cmp

917
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
and est and existing

918
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,440
uh

919
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,399
like

920
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,719
older certificate protocols

921
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,839
um

922
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,480
and like acme web authent enjoys fairly

923
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
ubiquitous library support across

924
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,679
languages and across platforms um

925
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
almost like every vendor already had to

926
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,719
build this for their browser

927
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
so it should be pretty easy to integrate

928
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
um into other parts of their platform

929
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,359
next slide please

930
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
hi everyone before we jump off that uh

931
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,839
for anyone that was in lamps maybe

932
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,960
shauna rich

933
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
didn't we learn that after some

934
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,399
discussion

935
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,918
with the uh the designated experts for

936
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,320
the web authent registry that the

937
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
approach wasn't what we thought it was

938
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,320
going to be for that lamps document you

939
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
yeah

940
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,560
got it

941
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
you can't put what was intended in that

942
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,040
registry

943
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,880
yeah

944
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,040
i believe the outcome was there are the

945
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,640
attestation formats that are already

946
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
defined in web offend there's an

947
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,720
extensible registry for that exists

948
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,079
already for formats that would make

949
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,640
sense for the primary use case of web

950
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,320
authent and we'll likely need to create

951
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,079
an additional registry for formats that

952
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,040
don't

953
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
fit into like the actual web off and

954
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,839
fido

955
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
scheme

956
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,640
i think there's another question

957
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,880
hank where's hank hank's not here

958
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
am

959
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,839
um

960
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,440
he's gone okay

961
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
um so what is the the draft uh proposed

962
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,320
changing um it adds a new challenge and

963
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,440
that challenge encapsulates a web authen

964
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,079
uh attestation statement format yeah we

965
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599
also have kathleen in the queue if you

966
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,920
want her yeah uh go ahead

967
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,640
kathleen

968
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,400
can you hear me now okay yes

969
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,880
i had asked on the list

970
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
and i'm hearing a bad echo i hope nobody

971
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,160
else is

972
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,800
nope just you

973
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,760
i'll power through it

974
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,119
i had asked on the list and

975
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,520
in the comments here

976
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
for the working group to

977
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,040
decide whether this should if adopted

978
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
be combined

979
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,839
with my client draft that already is

980
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
adopted

981
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
or if it should be separate

982
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
it already adds

983
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,000
web often as an authentication type

984
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,240
to be able to or a challenge rather

985
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,200
to

986
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,520
be able to get

987
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,040
a certificate so this is a little

988
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,480
different

989
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,680
but there could be a good bit

990
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,880
i'm not sure what if this

991
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,400
if the correct answer is a separate

992
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
draft or being included i will say that

993
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
the draft i'm proposing is fairly narrow

994
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,040
it only works it's for devices it's not

995
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,119
it doesn't touch certificates issued to

996
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
users or authenticating users uh it

997
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,160
doesn't touch code signing

998
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,280
and it

999
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,720
doesn't

1000
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,119
touch devices that lack the ability to

1001
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,599
attest their own identity

1002
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,839
so this is a

1003
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,520
fairly narrow focus

1004
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,960
and

1005
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,440
the the web offend usage in the client

1006
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
certificate draft is around actually

1007
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,880
using the full web offense spec this is

1008
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
narrowly tailored to only using

1009
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
datastation statement format as an

1010
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,040
encapsulation for attestations the rest

1011
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,680
of web authent has is has nothing to do

1012
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,640
with this proposal

1013
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,119
but i leave that up to the working group

1014
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,680
chairs i think

1015
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,920
okay hank are you back

1016
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,599
i'm trying again is this working

1017
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,200
yes

1018
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,119
wonderful okay

1019
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
yet another device hi

1020
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,560
um so um i've been asked to come here so

1021
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
i'm swinging by

1022
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,160
um the lamps id says that they use

1023
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
cryptographic attestation

1024
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
in order to establish the provenance of

1025
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,440
a key

1026
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
that's fine

1027
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,560
but that is not what a tpm does in

1028
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,839
general

1029
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,520
that's just one of the tiny things that

1030
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,560
tpm does the gpm creates evidence about

1031
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
the system characteristics that can

1032
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
prove its trustworthiness

1033
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,079
which has nothing to do with the web off

1034
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,760
and also

1035
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
it does not do that

1036
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,960
but they're also not it's true that's

1037
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
not entirely true and two

1038
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
can do that optionally

1039
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,599
um which makes me happy to hear when you

1040
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,000
say that it's just about framing i'm

1041
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,839
putting the evidence inside and i think

1042
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,920
that's the term i want to hear here if

1043
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,040
you're talking about the authenticity

1044
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,160
of a device that's phosphory meaning it

1045
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,000
is doing exactly what is intended to do

1046
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,640
and nothing else um then i think you are

1047
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,520
absolutely go okay with saying um

1048
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,560
attestation evidence but uh please uh

1049
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
differentiate between the uh

1050
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,280
the web off and capabilities

1051
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
the fact that they say over 500 times at

1052
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,640
the station and only mean it like four

1053
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,800
times i think between the tpm capability

1054
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
and uh and the other ones so just define

1055
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,800
are you creating assertions that are

1056
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,319
actually believable about the

1057
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,920
trustworthiness or are you really

1058
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
talking about key provenance which are

1059
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,040
which is part of the first but it's

1060
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,760
absolutely not the first but it said

1061
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,640
just highlighting that

1062
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,480
thank you that's helpful um

1063
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,079
tpms have

1064
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,599
many many things it can do in lots of

1065
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,520
options but

1066
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,319
what the rest of the attestation schemes

1067
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,240
actually do in reality is relatively

1068
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
simple they

1069
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
provide evidence that the key was

1070
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,880
generated in hardware and they

1071
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,920
provide

1072
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,760
uh an identity of the device that's

1073
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
associated with that um so for tpms to

1074
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,040
kind of exist side by side of these

1075
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,280
other attestation schemes we're really

1076
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,200
just using key certification

1077
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,760
um along with either the endorsement key

1078
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,040
or the platform

1079
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
or the endorsement certificate or the

1080
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,240
platform certificate to establish the

1081
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,118
identity of the device

1082
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,480
i think

1083
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,040
broader state attestation is kind of out

1084
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,280
of scope

1085
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,599
sorry for interrupting just state that

1086
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,680
up so don't use the term like at the

1087
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,960
station

1088
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,800
just state what you're doing like you

1089
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,920
just did and then mint the term in the

1090
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
context of your work

1091
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,839
that's fine you can call it grab it

1092
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,040
doesn't matter

1093
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
um the important thing is people

1094
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,480
understand what you're actually talking

1095
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,640
about and and think that's a big problem

1096
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
with throwing the term attestation

1097
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,880
around because it means nothing anymore

1098
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,960
if it you don't can't even say it's a if

1099
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,200
it's a procedure or a message

1100
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
so um if you're at that level i think uh

1101
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,000
really talking about the exact thing

1102
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
and defining it and then naming it is a

1103
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,079
better way around and then everybody

1104
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,680
would be happy and then you can

1105
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,400
tie android key to station and gpms and

1106
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,480
apple here to take whatever i do there

1107
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,680
and then that will make sense

1108
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
thanks

1109
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,400
how many thanks thank you for the

1110
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,599
feedback

1111
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,720
um

1112
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
so uh

1113
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,839
what is the actually contained in the

1114
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,640
extension uh it specifies a new

1115
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,960
challenge type um when this challenge

1116
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,280
type is presented to a client the client

1117
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,240
returns a web authentication statement

1118
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,200
format uh in the

1119
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
response payload the challenge response

1120
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,960
payload which is

1121
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
not done by any other

1122
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,040
challenge types anymore of today but

1123
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,079
the

1124
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,480
high level acme specification does

1125
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,319
have language around future

1126
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,599
specifications may do this um

1127
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,200
another way this could be done is

1128
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,680
involving an external verifier um where

1129
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,200
the acme server actually reaches out to

1130
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,079
the verifier um but based on discussions

1131
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,920
i've had most people seem to prefer the

1132
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,839
simpler method of passing data station

1133
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,800
directly to the acme server

1134
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,040
it also uses the acme specified key

1135
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,240
authorization

1136
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,720
as the nonce that's passed into

1137
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,319
the key generation methods of the

1138
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,240
various formats um

1139
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,000
and definitely open to feedback if this

1140
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
is the

1141
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,400
like the intended use of key

1142
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,119
authorization um

1143
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,319
ident i specify two identifiers um

1144
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,359
one uses the rfc 4043 permanent

1145
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,400
identifier

1146
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,560
to identify the platform

1147
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
um i also included

1148
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,200
uh a hardware module uh

1149
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
identifier that was specified in rfc

1150
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
4108 however i've gotten feedback this

1151
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,160
week that this may not be the best idea

1152
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
uh the reason i put that there in the

1153
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,359
first place was

1154
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,200
if you imagine a

1155
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,960
tpm device

1156
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,800
uh tpm included in a device that doesn't

1157
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
have an issued platform certificate

1158
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
the that device is actually unable to

1159
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,560
prove the identity of the device it's

1160
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,839
only able to prove the identity of the

1161
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,200
tpm which is a different assertion than

1162
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
would be made if a platform shift exists

1163
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,880
or with the other attestation schemes

1164
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,280
which do attempt to prove the actual

1165
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,119
identity of the entire device not just

1166
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,079
the security chip included in it

1167
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,119
i also added informative text around

1168
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,760
using external account binding for

1169
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
pre-authenticating requests to the ca

1170
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
in my experience most enterprise

1171
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,800
environments don't want to have

1172
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
uh except unauthenticated requests on

1173
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,880
the open internet so they're

1174
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
likely would want to include this in

1175
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,920
some form of configuration management um

1176
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,440
that's pushed down to the device before

1177
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,640
it um is able to

1178
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
prove its identity um

1179
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,319
next slide please do you want to take

1180
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,640
the question yeah

1181
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
ron

1182
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,440
was just going to comment that

1183
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,599
i did something similar in a proprietary

1184
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,200
implementation of

1185
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,920
a

1186
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,440
new challenge type with a challenge

1187
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
response that contained

1188
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,920
a um

1189
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,920
a jwt authentication token using

1190
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,310
the

1191
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,440
[Music]

1192
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,160
the d-pop work

1193
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,400
and that seemed to work quite well so

1194
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,160
that seems like quite a sensible thing

1195
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,440
to me

1196
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,040
so

1197
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
thank you good to hear it thank you

1198
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,520
so existing implementation um

1199
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,040
i created a fork of small step which is

1200
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,480
a uh not a fork per se uh patch series

1201
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,640
of patches a small step it's a open

1202
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,480
source golang ca

1203
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,560
um that

1204
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,880
along with a client that implements this

1205
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,839
for tpm at a station um

1206
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,760
and he also includes a tpm simulator in

1207
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,119
case you want to run this on a regular

1208
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,960
laptop

1209
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,000
the demonstration ca also later added

1210
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,800
support for apple's managed device

1211
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
at a station feature that they launched

1212
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,040
wwc

1213
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,119
the other major implementation of this

1214
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,680
is apple's ios

1215
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,599
16 betas

1216
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,680
that uses this uses

1217
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,839
uh encoding including an acme uh web

1218
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:13,440
authentication statement in acme

1219
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,119
as the basis of requesting a certificate

1220
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,079
alongside skep and sending the private

1221
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,319
key plus certificate in a p12 payload or

1222
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,599
the other two

1223
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,319
methods they spot on older versions

1224
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,319
and not included on this version of the

1225
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,440
slides

1226
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,359
android has also

1227
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,920
put this on their roadmap to include

1228
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,720
alongside apple

1229
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
next slide

1230
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,920
please and uh now i have some questions

1231
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,520
uh for everyone

1232
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,839
um

1233
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,599
there's been some discussions i've had

1234
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,200
this week around

1235
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,880
um

1236
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,720
the the types of information that can be

1237
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,319
reflected into the client certificate

1238
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,640
that the ca has validated

1239
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,640
these would include things like the

1240
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,400
identity of the device the identity of

1241
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,520
the

1242
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,800
security chip

1243
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,119
the key generation properties

1244
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,720
key generation properties seem like a

1245
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,839
specifically controversial

1246
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,440
thing to identify that

1247
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,839
has a lot of complexity about what does

1248
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
harder backed mean

1249
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,760
what are the relative trust levels of a

1250
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,440
trust trust zone versus discrete

1251
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,160
hardware versus hardware on diverse

1252
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,520
hardware on a bus

1253
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,079
um and

1254
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
is this draft the place should be or is

1255
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,880
that somewhere else because that's a

1256
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,720
pretty hard problem it sounds like

1257
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,559
and

1258
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,400
the verification procedures this came up

1259
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,559
on the mailing list someone asked okay

1260
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,240
why would my enterprise ca trust any of

1261
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,200
this

1262
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,119
um each of the different attestation

1263
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,359
formats has various levels of quality of

1264
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,839
documentation

1265
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,920
the documentation where it does exist

1266
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,839
there's often

1267
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,680
asterisks and foot guns that if

1268
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,599
implemented improperly caused the system

1269
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,320
not to be secure

1270
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,960
[Music]

1271
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,839
and

1272
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,839
i don't believe there's any place this

1273
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,079
is really specified i think web authent

1274
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,400
has done the best cross attestation

1275
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,359
scheme attempt at documenting but

1276
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,359
i know there's issues with

1277
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,559
um

1278
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,960
like it's not complete with all of the

1279
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,240
the foot guns and asterisks

1280
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,000
does this belong in the the rats uh

1281
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
working group does it belong in this

1282
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,599
document does this document have any

1283
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,440
does this document stand alone without

1284
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,640
attempting to specify how you implement

1285
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,559
verifiers for each of these schemes in a

1286
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,839
secure and correct manner

1287
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,240
sean

1288
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,480
sean turner um so in full disclosure i

1289
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,920
am writing a draft and lamps about this

1290
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,760
kid station stuff over there so i'm

1291
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,680
basically supportive of this approach

1292
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,440
for the first one it seems like that is

1293
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,720
a

1294
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,640
hole that you could be buried in for a

1295
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,720
long long time did we just set up a

1296
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
registry and leave it alone make it

1297
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,359
first come first serve and knock

1298
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,960
yourself out so the mechanism is there

1299
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,400
to be able to specify what those things

1300
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,839
are and just

1301
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,640
punt

1302
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,079
completely because that would be an

1303
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,280
option to do that because if you're

1304
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,359
going to try to document all of them

1305
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,559
good luck you'll come back and you'll

1306
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,200
have a long gray beard like i do yeah um

1307
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,119
the verification procedures you have to

1308
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,280
put something in there right but

1309
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,319
if it's

1310
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,000
if it's really that complicated but

1311
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,200
again there's a bunch of different

1312
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,680
options i don't know how you write that

1313
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,200
right so then you end up in this hole of

1314
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,960
like if you do this and then you do this

1315
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,000
and if you did this then you're gonna

1316
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,079
use 12 other things so i'm not quite

1317
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,520
sure how to

1318
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,119
how to solve that one but the first one

1319
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,960
i think just maybe make a registry and

1320
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,359
call it a day

1321
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
yeah i think it's it's fairly tractable

1322
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,599
to document verification procedures

1323
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,520
until you try to do it correctly and

1324
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,200
then it

1325
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,240
gets very complex from there

1326
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,760
sorry

1327
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,359
q is mine

1328
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,400
um

1329
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,280
so

1330
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,640
i have a couple of comments on this um

1331
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,359
[Music]

1332
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,839
one

1333
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,079
is we need to make sure that this is

1334
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,800
actually all verifiable

1335
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,839
if

1336
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,520
um

1337
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,920
the acme or the ca that's issuing the

1338
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,200
acme certs

1339
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,520
or the relying party that then gets the

1340
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,480
certs

1341
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,920
can't

1342
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,079
be assured that the data in the cert is

1343
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,520
correct

1344
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,559
then

1345
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,280
we're going the wrong way

1346
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,160
if the ca can't tell

1347
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,480
whether the device

1348
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,280
i mean the device can't just say hi

1349
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,880
i'm a tpm

1350
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,200
without proof that he is actually a tpm

1351
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,079
right so you have to be able to validate

1352
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,559
that now it appears i've spent like 15

1353
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,880
minutes reading this stuff it appears

1354
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,040
that android and

1355
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,119
a bunch of places have basically root

1356
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,200
cas that

1357
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,319
assert that these are devices that they

1358
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,559
have built

1359
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,070
so that's fine um

1360
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,119
[Music]

1361
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,760
within the realm of how trustworthy that

1362
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,160
is seeing that's another rabbit hole

1363
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,400
um

1364
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,599
[Music]

1365
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,680
so that was my my main when i first saw

1366
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,000
this my main concern was

1367
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,400
who's this who who gets to decide

1368
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
whether this is what it really is and i

1369
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
can't self-assert like self-assertion

1370
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
should not be possible

1371
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,520
oh my opinion um

1372
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,520
so that's that's part of it there was

1373
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,559
had another point what was it

1374
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,800
um i think you can't when you talk about

1375
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,280
key generation and the quality of key

1376
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,839
generation there's no way for a ca or of

1377
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,359
a lying party to know how well you've

1378
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,520
done key generation and you're back to

1379
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,839
basically self-assertion at that point

1380
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,880
there's no way for an acme ca to know

1381
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,440
that this tpm over there did it this way

1382
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,240
for real right i believe there is

1383
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,520
it's

1384
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,599
fairly key certification is not simple

1385
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,040
with tpms and there's again many ways to

1386
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,599
do it incorrectly but it is possible

1387
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,119
and can the ca tell it's been done

1388
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,880
incorrectly yes

1389
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,079
how

1390
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,720
um when you generate a key the the

1391
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,839
policy is encoded um in a string that is

1392
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,520
signed and verifiable

1393
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,240
so

1394
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,160
if the key is not generated in the

1395
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,640
expected manner so for example tpms

1396
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,319
allow key importation and they also

1397
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,359
allow key generation and you can

1398
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,480
actually tell the difference whether a

1399
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,760
key was imported or generated um it can

1400
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,760
it provides evidence whether it was rsi

1401
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,160
or ecdsa

1402
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,200
and

1403
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,800
if you if you're in an environment that

1404
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,599
has a attestation ca or a private cca

1405
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,599
that is willing to de-anonymize clients

1406
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,400
as

1407
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,960
is in an enterprise environment um

1408
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,280
the privacy ca can pass along the

1409
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,040
identifiers included either in the

1410
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,319
endorsement key certificate which

1411
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,040
identifies the gpm chip itself or the

1412
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
platform certificate which identifies

1413
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,240
the the combination of a tpm and a

1414
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,280
platform

1415
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,240
how do i know the tpm hasn't lied

1416
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,000
uh the the t like the tpm has an

1417
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,440
endorsement key certificate which is

1418
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,520
included um you do what's called

1419
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,839
credential activation and tcg terms to

1420
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,200
turn a

1421
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,760
decrypt only ek into a signing ak

1422
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,839
attestation key and the attestation key

1423
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,480
going forward signs

1424
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,559
actually signs the key certification

1425
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,119
data that is sent to acme ca so if you

1426
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,119
trust the tpm vendor

1427
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,800
you can trust

1428
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,680
yeah okay so there's

1429
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,839
um

1430
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,440
pitfalls here i think

1431
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,280
is probably the best way to say that i

1432
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
am generally untrustworthy of these

1433
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,760
things um so maybe i'm a little um and

1434
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,440
this is no hats by the way

1435
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,319
um this is just me

1436
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,200
um

1437
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,559
since monty is staying right behind i

1438
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,559
will pick on the trusted computing group

1439
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,319
a little bit um

1440
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,040
android chrome os and apple have

1441
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,960
implemented their attestation schemes in

1442
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
a way so for example apple's managed

1443
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,680
device attestation if it generates a key

1444
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,440
at all and it produces an agitation

1445
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,119
certificate that was generated in their

1446
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,880
secure enclave processor there's no

1447
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,800
other way to get so right so as long as

1448
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,160
the enclave processor is working

1449
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,760
correctly you're good

1450
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,280
if it's failed

1451
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,400
you're screwed right

1452
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,599
the trust in the

1453
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,880
the tpm

1454
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,559
monty wiseman by the way

1455
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,880
um the trust of the tpm is

1456
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,160
anchored in whoever signs the ek

1457
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,119
certificate which says who made the tpm

1458
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,440
that's really not any different

1459
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,640
than trusting apple to say the key and

1460
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,960
the t2s the same is good

1461
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,880
just in android that's really not any

1462
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,119
different than trusting infineon to make

1463
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,680
the tpm the only real difference is it's

1464
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,839
portable across platforms

1465
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,880
um

1466
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
so anyway i'm gonna

1467
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,599
go on the other

1468
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,280
the other topic the reason i came up

1469
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,559
here is

1470
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,880
i think a document like this is a really

1471
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,640
good place to put

1472
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,000
values

1473
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,760
you know maybe hardware i don't i'll

1474
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,160
make the same comment i made in lamps i

1475
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,760
think it's going to be hard with a

1476
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,839
binary assertion of hardware versus not

1477
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:20,960
hardware

1478
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,079
um

1479
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,520
but

1480
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,280
the distinction

1481
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,760
any distinctions we made about we make

1482
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,359
about quality

1483
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,040
should not go in here needs to go

1484
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,520
somewhere else otherwise it becomes

1485
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,760
exactly the same comment labs

1486
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,280
so we're gonna have to find a way to

1487
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,400
enumerate these somehow right to make

1488
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,880
any value assertion between a software

1489
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,280
tpm that's running in my process

1490
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,440
that i have happen to have an ek signed

1491
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,920
by something on my platform and an

1492
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,920
affinian tpm or

1493
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,680
something else we have to find some way

1494
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,160
to make a distinction between those

1495
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,599
something like this doesn't need to

1496
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,920
worry about that we just need to

1497
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,640
have some value that somebody else

1498
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,200
decides not this one

1499
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,520
yeah i tend to agree given that

1500
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,720
there's going to be three different

1501
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,319
documents that specify for for tls for

1502
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,040
uh the right three at least three

1503
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,520
documents i think i heard a fourth

1504
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,880
that's gonna need it so yeah

1505
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,839
yes um

1506
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,520
aaron

1507
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,319
yeah

1508
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,240
uh

1509
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,000
having having read the stock when it

1510
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,119
first went out on the mailing list i

1511
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,119
i think it's completely appropriate for

1512
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,920
this document to not specify

1513
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,400
exactly what the ca is supposed to do in

1514
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,559
order to determine whether it trusts the

1515
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,240
attestation that it receives because

1516
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,559
that's a matter for like five different

1517
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,880
documents because it is

1518
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,119
very difficult the thing that surprised

1519
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,200
me was that this document didn't talk

1520
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,920
about that at all i was expecting a

1521
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,400
paragraph that was like and when you

1522
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,799
receive the key attestation

1523
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:01,680
you

1524
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,280
should make sure that you trust it via

1525
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,680
informative reference to some other set

1526
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,280
of things that might be useful instead

1527
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,359
it was just like the ca gets the

1528
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,440
attestation back and is good to go and i

1529
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,000
was like i am very confused now

1530
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,240
um so so some sort of reference to the

1531
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,680
fact that this is a hard problem and

1532
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,200
ca's need to do it correctly would be

1533
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,720
very appropriate but i don't think it

1534
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,280
should be fully specified

1535
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,760
yeah here

1536
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,280
totally agree i appreciate the feedback

1537
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,200
and i'll definitely add that um i think

1538
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,280
i ended up basically writing the

1539
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,880
informative text out on the mailing list

1540
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,280
anyways so i think i can just

1541
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,240
put that in the document

1542
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,599
hi

1543
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,359
yeah i agree that there's a lot missing

1544
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,480
in the document like there's no um

1545
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,520
um

1546
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,599
no example of the uh

1547
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,559
um posters get with the new identifiers

1548
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,160
but that's fine and

1549
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,760
it's really a zero zero um version

1550
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,559
so yes carl

1551
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,558
carl are you still with us

1552
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,640
i was just going to say on the second

1553
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,078
question here um

1554
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,480
um well i thought so maybe you don't

1555
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,839
hear me

1556
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,680
no we'll see you we hear you too so

1557
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,000
you're good

1558
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,680
there's a terrible lag so i'm just i'm

1559
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,839
just going to speak okay um

1560
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,680
the verification procedures have to be

1561
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,319
in a separate document

1562
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,000
that's all i was going to say over

1563
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,520
okay thank you so um

1564
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,319
so you have some open questions for us

1565
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,400
we have an obvious question for you are

1566
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,200
you seeking adoption

1567
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,960
yes i am um in consideration of vendors

1568
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,599
already beginning to support this um

1569
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,200
i would love to get as much feedback

1570
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,960
about bachelor encoding

1571
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,920
of the requests as soon as possible um

1572
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,440
i think there's been

1573
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,400
broad interest on the mailing list for

1574
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,319
someone to write something whether it be

1575
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,839
an existing draft or a new draft um

1576
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,359
it does seem like people are attempting

1577
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,319
to use kieva station and acme and cmp

1578
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,079
and est and tls and seems to be a very

1579
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,680
prominent topic this year

1580
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,440
okay so that of course we'll go on the

1581
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,359
mailing list um

1582
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,240
so uh thank you

1583
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
so we're out of time how did we do that

1584
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,480
it was supposed to be short yeah

1585
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
we used the time exactly i mean we even

1586
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,720
have 30 seconds for any other business

1587
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,880
which i guess

1588
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,359
we're all getting back okay

1589
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,720
thank you all

1590
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,480
right enjoy the rest of your eye

1591
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,319
more physically in

1592
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,680

1594
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,839
thank you

1595
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,799
