so i see the slides

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
and you see them too i guess right

177
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
yep take it away maximilian

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
cool thank you good evening to

179
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,080
philadelphia

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
so

181
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
i put it forward or we freddie is also

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
present in the audience um put a draft

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
forward to define a well-known bgp

184
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,480
community to denate the dote prefixes

185
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
are used for any cast

186
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
and we want to say what we saw or what

187
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
is the reason behind it

188
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
so short motivation

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
who am i

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
networker open source hacker work by

191
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,839
work for cloudflare who also sponsoring

192
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
this

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
you can find me on twitter or reach out

194
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
by mail

195
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
so why did we do that so assume a swiss

196
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,240
isp

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
who has international network

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
intercontinental network and for example

199
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
wants to transform

200
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
transport packets to the us

201
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,519
directly so would like to

202
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
prefer the own path where own equipment

203
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
over the pond

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,680
but would also like to

205
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
route any cast prefixes locally because

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
of the nature of any cast for a lot of

207
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
providers having different pops around

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
the world usually the hot potato path

209
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
would be best and

210
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
given many providers also use dns

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,959
anycast and then point customers or

212
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,399
clients to

213
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
the preferred servers this might

214
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
influence some

215
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
user

216
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,079
latency and experience in general

217
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,120
so

218
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,839
then we came up with the idea okay if we

219
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,560
could denote prefixes i used for anycast

220
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
that would help people to do more

221
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
better informed routing decisions

222
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,320
so the idea is to specify a well-known

223
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,120
bgp community to do that

224
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
so not everyone um or every provider has

225
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
to define a different one and t gets

226
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,480
messy

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
that's basically the idea and

228
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
the proposed solution is as i said

229
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
define a well-known pgp community

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
we will ask operators who want to denote

231
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,760
their prefixes are used for anycast to

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,200
either specify it on all places or in

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
none

234
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,040
so it does not make total sense to only

235
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
specify it in a few places

236
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
um and the idea is if this is specified

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,959
we ask people to use hot potato routing

238
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
for it but that's in everyone's best

239
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
judgment

240
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
as was pointed out on the mailing list

241
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
this might have influences on route

242
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,920
server operators which may introduce an

243
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,240
option to filter for any cast prefixes

244
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
to take that into consideration when

245
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,480
doing te and this also what also brought

246
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
up on the mailing list

247
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
this might influence

248
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,120
your network when doing route reflection

249
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
optimal route reflection was brought

250
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,440
into the mix as well as at paths

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
um

252
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,360
i

253
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
say we led it to operators to define the

254
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
best path forward there i think it would

255
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
not be good to prescribe a solution

256
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
and that's basically the idea the draft

257
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,519
has been put forward it's in version

258
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
01 it's all out there on the list

259
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
and we are open to your feedback

260
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,200
that's basically it thank you

261
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
and with that we open up the floor for

262
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,880
uh discussion and i hope there will be

263
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,040
some some uh

264
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
sharing of perspectives on this topic

265
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,439
because

266
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,560
the implications must be

267
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
thoroughly understood

268
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
i see somebody at the mic

269
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,000
hey keir patel arcus

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
nice draft

271
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
quick question

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
do you think it makes sense to use

273
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
large community and append ess also

274
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
to talk about

275
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
what anycast

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
uh community if any you're doing or you

277
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
rather prefer this to be on a generic

278
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
community

279
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,639
just

280
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
broke okay audio seems to be back

281
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
i think i got most of the question

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
we thought about using large communities

283
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
but

284
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
i guess people in this audience can't

285
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,440
answer the question if it's a good idea

286
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
to use them today better i was afraid

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,320
that there still might be systems out

288
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
there which do not implement large

289
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,600
communities i don't know about that

290
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
that's why the idea was to go for

291
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
classical communities

292
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,480
and i believe part of the question was

293
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
to imp to

294
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,880
entail the as which is sending this into

295
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,399
the community

296
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,040
which somehow would defeat the point of

297
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,519
only having one community to filter

298
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
against

299
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
ben madison work online um

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
thanks for the draft i think it's i i

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
think it's an interesting problem space

302
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,639
um

303
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
i think that there's a

304
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
i think there's a kind of a tension

305
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
between

306
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,680
the engineering problem you're trying to

307
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
solve

308
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,839
and the social reality that it exists in

309
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,000
um speaking for you know for myself and

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
the network that i operate

311
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
i wouldn't allow

312
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
any third-party network that

313
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
to send me

314
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,920
hints

315
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
that alters my local routing policy

316
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
without a substantial degree of trust

317
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
in

318
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
the person who is sending it

319
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,720
and it seems to me that

320
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
because that mechanism requires some

321
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
degree of social interaction whether

322
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,639
it's kind of like remotely over email or

323
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
forums like this or nogs or peering

324
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,920
forums or whatever

325
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
it kind the fact that that trust needs

326
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,560
to be established anyway

327
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,279
means that there's plenty of opportunity

328
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,839
to to

329
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,079
exchange operator specific communities

330
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,839
during those conversations and those

331
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,079
relationships anyway so i think that you

332
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
end up kind of losing the benefits of

333
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
having a single well-known community

334
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
with universal semantics because you've

335
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
got to do all of that social networking

336
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
work to make it useful anyway to make it

337
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
trustworthy

338
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
um and so i wonder how

339
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,240
useful this end up ends up being in

340
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,720
practice

341
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
fair point um the security side of this

342
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
or the aspect has been brought up on the

343
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
mailing list also

344
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
um

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
i'd say in combination with rpki it

346
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
should be okay to filter on community

347
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
and is our community and prefix list

348
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
potentially

349
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,160
but i still see the point so you should

350
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,839
think about what you are doing when you

351
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,399
implement that

352
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
i would like to live in a world in which

353
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
rpk could help with this but that's not

354
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,320
a world that we live in currently um

355
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
trying to make secu trying to secure

356
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,800
communities is a hard problem

357
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
uh hi there tom hill from bt

358
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
um

359
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
the all or nothing

360
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
solution as a proposal is interesting

361
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,839
even as a should rather than a

362
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,279
must i can see that going very wrong

363
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,720
on the basis that either there are

364
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
transient issues or

365
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
perhaps even

366
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
folks who aren't paying enough attention

367
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,160
maybe

368
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
so is there a way in which you envision

369
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
we may track hygiene

370
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
of prefixes announced with this

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
particular community and

372
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
you know make make make the owners of

373
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
the prefix aware that they've perhaps

374
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
not done this in a all or nothing

375
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
fashion

376
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
otherwise we we

377
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,359
i feel like we stand to be in a

378
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
situation where that's very easily going

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,679
to become quite a mess

380
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,760
if past experience is anything to go by

381
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
i see your point

382
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,839
given

383
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
that i got shamed on twitter a while

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
back for doing a route leak um i know

385
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,840
these

386
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
solutions exist

387
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,559
and can be built so i guess going on

388
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
route information services etc this

389
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
should be possible

390
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
so you suggest that the current routing

391
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
leak detection services or

392
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,880
apparatus be extended to point out when

393
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
the anycast community is not in an all

394
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,520
or nothing fashion

395
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
advertised in all or nothing fashion

396
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
i guess suggest would be a strong word

397
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,720
for my taste

398
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
but

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
what i guess would be a good idea for

400
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
operators who want to go down this path

401
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,160
and announce their prefixes with this we

402
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,120
could ask them to monitor it given

403
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
route views risks or etc

404
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,400
does that make sense

405
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
it makes sense to ask them yes

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
definitely

407
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,799
you don't seem convinced

408
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,600
jeff i'm mostly here to remind this

409
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,679
working group and my esteemed co-chair

410
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,240
of idr there is no such thing as a

411
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
well-known large community

412
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,600
stop trying to do that

413
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
well

414
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
arc is here again one

415
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,760
for one more time

416
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,559
i that was precisely what i was trying

417
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,200
to indicate that while there is not one

418
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
you could probably define one and get

419
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,240
away i i have a feeling

420
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,360
that you do want to tell your neighbor

421
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
asses even when you are sending out the

422
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
well-known communities to tag at least

423
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
and say which is that

424
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,039
these are propagating from or

425
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
originating from and you are appending

426
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
it and so forth and so on

427
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
but don't we know that by looking at the

428
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,480
as path

429
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
to to interject here

430
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
from the as path you don't

431
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
know which of the asm's in the as path

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
attached the

433
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
well-known

434
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,320
1997 community

435
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,679
but there is no large communities

436
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,559
registry for

437
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
this type of functionality

438
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
so it would be

439
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,559
good to have a discussion on the mailing

440
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,919
list whether a uh extended community

441
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,600
that has room for the

442
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
sender asn or setter of the community

443
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,360
but

444
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
uh opinions differ on on whether

445
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
extended communities are uh useful in

446
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
this type of work environment so that's

447
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
why i would

448
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,039
discuss it on the mailing list

449
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,720
to to see

450
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,080
what comes out of the woodworks

451
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
um

452
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
rudiger you're actually last in line uh

453
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
first we're going to go to linda

454
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,799
dunbar

455
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,120
linda

456
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
uh yes um

457
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
maybe this question is for the group so

458
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
i'm wondering like since then anik has

459
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
used so widely can any cast being

460
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
treated like a multicast like all the

461
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
ports belong to that anycast register

462
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
for that so that the network know how to

463
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
forward instead of

464
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
putting to the extended community just

465
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
the question

466
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
i i'm sorry i didn't think i i heard

467
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
your question would you mind typing down

468
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,520
the question in the chat to overcome

469
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,760
potential audio issues

470
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,919
okay

471
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
thank you um

472
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
okay

473
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,919
uh in the meantime we'll jump to david's

474
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
dominant

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,840
as an implementer with a little clue um

476
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,360
i have a question about the trust

477
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
relationship brought up earlier

478
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,280
isn't this really two separate things

479
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
one being

480
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
the advertisement in a permissive way

481
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
and informative way about tagging

482
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,919
something as an anycast prefix

483
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,039
versus

484
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
having an expectation of something

485
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
happening due to that like i understand

486
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
that the latter is something that will

487
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,720
rely on relationships like that but

488
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,360
i don't need a relationship to

489
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
make use of this to just flag things

490
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
that i'm advertising

491
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,960
sorry

492
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
um yeah that's that's totally true um

493
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
and

494
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
from reading the draft it doesn't sound

495
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
like there was an expectation that this

496
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,840
would be useful just as an fyi

497
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
but if it is useful just as an fyi then

498
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
sure there's that then it's then it's

499
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
absolutely fine um my my concern was

500
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
that

501
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,440
if there's an expectation that people

502
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
will actually

503
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
you know blindly or semi-blindly act on

504
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
this in the routine policies i think

505
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
that's a mistaken assumption

506
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,080
agreed

507
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
next up mr falk

508
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
thank you

509
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
uh

510
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
just

511
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
comment

512
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
yes

513
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,559
large community space

514
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
has not yet assigned

515
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,159
any

516
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,440
parts of the of the name space for

517
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
special purposes but the space is large

518
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,559
and interesting things could be done

519
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,000
and

520
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
in my not so humble opinion probably

521
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
should

522
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
the

523
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,600
yeah well okay it is quite clear that uh

524
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
the attachment

525
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
uh of

526
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
um

527
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,480
communities can be manipulated by any as

528
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,840
on the path

529
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,480
um

530
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
no question

531
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
about that

532
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,039
but uh

533
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,640
my guess is that uh the assumption for

534
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
any caste

535
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,880
tagging

536
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
would be that

537
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,960
every time uh exactly the originating as

538
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
would would do the tagging

539
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,720
um kind of that some intermediate as

540
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,600
uh has the knowledge that yes well okay

541
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
this transiting

542
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
announcement

543
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,919
is anycast and

544
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
not getting the signal from the first

545
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
place

546
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,720
looks a little bit strange

547
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
so

548
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,400
one second can the people using the

549
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
floor microphone

550
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,919
not only speak into the microphone but

551
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,760
also speak a little bit louder because

552
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,600
remote participants are telling us that

553
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,240
the signal is a bit low

554
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
and if there meet echo people

555
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
on the link

556
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
chris is wandering around and poking at

557
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
stuff so i'll carry on talking until

558
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,840
how's

559
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,320
that far okay perfect is this better rob

560
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,440
austin

561
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,200
hello rob austin how is this

562
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,360
[Laughter]

563
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,080
excellent

564
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
so

565
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,039
warren so warren kumari with no hats

566
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,840
so

567
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
i mean networks kind of generally decide

568
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
if they want to do hot potato or not and

569
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
that's the decision that they make

570
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,240
there's nothing here that actually stops

571
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,880
me from just applying this to any old

572
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,559
route that i feel like

573
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,799
so if i send you 500 routes i can tag

574
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,120
499 of them with this or i could tag one

575
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,360
and it seems like i can choose whatever

576
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
routing policy i would like with this

577
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
if instead of this being called sort of

578
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,120
the any cost bgp community it was like i

579
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,880
wish you to use a different routing

580
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
policy community

581
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
it feels like that might

582
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,120
be a better sales pitch right like this

583
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
isn't specifically for any cost this is

584
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,640
please use your non-standard policy for

585
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,880
this prefix

586
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,919
hmm the intention was to use it for any

587
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,919
car so people can but make better

588
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,480
informed decisions on what approach to

589
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
take

590
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
ben madison again um just on the subject

591
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
of whether it's helpful

592
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,480
for there to be a

593
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
um for the for the

594
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,919
sort the

595
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,200
the attack the

596
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
the as that's attaching the community to

597
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,200
the prefix which is probably the origin

598
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
being encoded in the community i think

599
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
that

600
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
that kind of assumes that this is useful

601
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
more than one hop away

602
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,919
and

603
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
my already

604
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,520
limited

605
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
inclination to change routing policy

606
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
based on this kind of a community would

607
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,279
fall off an exponential cliff with every

608
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,760
additional as hop in the path

609
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,080
so i think that

610
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
if this is useful at all i'd be amazed

611
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
if it's useful more than a single hop

612
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,360
away personally

613
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,159
so i think that rather loses its utility

614
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
again if it's not just you being used

615
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,679
for informational purposes if it's

616
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
purely informational then sure that's

617
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,719
additional signal and signal is good

618
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,240
thank you

619
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,679
next up a

620
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
remote participant freddie

621
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
kunsler if i'm pronouncing your last

622
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
name correctly

623
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,600
well sort of

624
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
it's actually clear but that's okay

625
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
uh

626
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
good afternoon good evening good morning

627
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,279
um

628
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,039
i'm one of the uh proposal and actually

629
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,720
um maximilian wrote everything but i

630
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,520
could probably give and i the idea why

631
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,799
it came up

632
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
we

633
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
being the swiss isp maximilian was

634
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
talking about

635
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,679
and

636
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,960
some years back we were selling transit

637
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
i think it was in frankfurt

638
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,919
to a network which was selling transits

639
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,320
uh somewhere to network somewhere in the

640
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,440
middle east i think it was iran

641
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,640
and they were transiting quite a lot of

642
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
um

643
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,159
announcing quite a lot of prefixes and

644
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,760
one was actually

645
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
one of these

646
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
dns

647
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
anycast

648
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
servers i've got which one but uh

649
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,799
what happened then when you when you

650
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
sell transit you usually

651
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
uh do them higher local craft and then

652
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,080
peering or or um

653
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
for upstream

654
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
so

655
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
our users our uh broadband customers in

656
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
switzerland they were actually then

657
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
using the

658
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,679
uh um dns anycast server in the middle

659
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,200
east somewhere with high latency etc etc

660
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
if we would have known that that

661
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
specific prefix

662
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
is actually

663
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,360
in any cost prefix we would have

664
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,240
filtered that away from the transit

665
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,200
and

666
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
um so we we learned it the hard way but

667
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
if uh those any cost operators would

668
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,799
actually denote their any cost prefixes

669
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,640
it just would make my life a lot easier

670
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
and the quality of of the service we

671
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
provide to the end customer would

672
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,640
increase

673
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
of course

674
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
it could be abused

675
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,600
but usually um the any card operators

676
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,919
they know what they're doing so we could

677
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,000
expect some more clue

678
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
of any cast operators than

679
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
sort of normal operators and

680
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,080
that is basically why i ask everyone to

681
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,840
support this proposal

682
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,840
okay any more questions or comments

683
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
i think there's still some discussion

684
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
have you had about this on the list oh

685
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,640
go are you getting up to ask no no okay

686
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
i think the next presenter is trying to

687
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,200
move to the to the mic okay so

688
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,520
i think

689
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
um

690
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
i guess a valid question at this point

691
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,279
in time is do we want to work on the

692
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
anycast community as a working group

693
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,000
documents

694
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
i think that's a question for the list

695
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
that's what i meant

696
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,159
um and a final comment uh i think the

697
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,640
current draft doesn't really define what

698
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
any cast means in this context so it

699
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,279
would be good to add a paragraph

700
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,640
clarifying

701
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,600
uh

702
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,159
a term that amongst network operators is

703
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,039
uh

704
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,440
pretty well understood but

705
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
for the purpose of the

706
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,520
itf internet draft it would be helpful

707
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
to to explain what anycast means in this

708
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,159
context

709
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,360
um

710
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,399
okay and with that we jump to bmp and

711
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,719
yang

712
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,080
thank you

713
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,399
thank you so much maximilian

714
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,600
so hello i'm camilo cardona for ntt

715
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
he has actually pointed kind of directly

716
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,799
to your mouth

717
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,320
yeah

718
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
that's right you can do that just hold

719
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,120
it okay

720
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,159
so camilo cardona from ntt and i'm going

721
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,120
to give

722
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,320
update into the bmp gen module draft so

723
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,799
next please

724
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,039
[Music]

725
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
so we added a few things to the

726
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,159
connection to the station

727
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,279
one of them was um we specifically had a

728
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
choice now to connect to the station be

729
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,799
active or passive

730
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,399
so i do not know how many people use

731
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,760
passive in

732
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
real life but but it's included in the

733
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,799
bmp specifications so we added that it

734
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,039
does add to the complexity of the model

735
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,720
but it is what it is

736
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
we are at maximum segment size keep a

737
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,360
lives and session security session

738
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,039
security we basically copy it from the

739
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,559
bgp draft

740
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,879
model

741
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
jeff pointed us out uh some hits so we

742
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,640
will probably take a look at that again

743
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,039
and see if it fits on the vmp one and

744
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,440
how to do it i keep allies we copied it

745
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,919
from the tcpm module too i don't know if

746
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,279
it's going to fit perfectly so we'll

747
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,440
take a look at that again

748
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,919
and there it is so we also added network

749
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
instance to the bmp sources so jeff jeff

750
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,320
always points out these things so he

751
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
pointed out that we were missing that

752
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,880
and

753
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,799
now we added them and i'll talk about

754
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,799
that in a second

755
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,559
again

756
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,039
in the draft per se we basically change

757
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,760
a few sentences and add an example uh we

758
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,279
probably need to add more examples in

759
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,760
the future i i really like examples in

760
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
when when you're reading models but

761
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,120
that's for the future

762
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
okay so i wanted to explain this again

763
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,320
um

764
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,880
so it would be nice i'm

765
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,559
awesome that we could get all the

766
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,640
information in the world from from these

767
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
routers but it is bad for the wire

768
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,679
it is bad for the collection and for

769
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,080
analyzing we don't have process for that

770
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
so the idea that we have on this draft

771
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
is that

772
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,519
you as an operator can specify clearly

773
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,279
what information you want and that we do

774
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,880
it flexibly

775
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
but also

776
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,640
with no ambiguity and

777
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
i mean in a

778
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
precise way

779
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,919
so right now we have four

780
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,320
sorry four areas that we we use to

781
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
specify the data one of them is network

782
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,799
instances that we didn't have previously

783
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,320
so the idea here is that you specify

784
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
which network is from which network

785
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,240
instance you want to get data from

786
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,279
and we added an uh an identity called

787
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,720
vmpn and types on the idti that allows

788
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
you to specify that you want the data

789
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,000
from all network instances

790
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,519
remotes

791
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,919
well the typical remotes from bmp has

792
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,240
been in pre and post has been out pre

793
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,679
and post and local

794
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,640
rip

795
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,480
here there are no shortcuts you have to

796
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
be explicit on what you want the same

797
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,399
for address families we take the adverse

798
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
families values from the bgp um jan

799
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,640
module so

800
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
we'll see how the two interplay but

801
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,360
we're taking it from there annum peers

802
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,918
which is um

803
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,079
well this one is a bit more complicated

804
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,399
uh so you can specify of course prc

805
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,399
individually when you're based on their

806
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,079
ip address and using the bgp module

807
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
but you can also specify the type of

808
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
peers that you want your data from and

809
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
we are we are doing it right now with

810
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,639
the vtp module we might change that

811
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,320
later so you can say for instance give

812
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
me all the data from our external peers

813
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,599
which is something that we see very

814
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
often

815
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,560
that you don't want to specify you don't

816
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,000
want to get internal peers you want

817
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,599
their external but you want to take them

818
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,359
one by one so

819
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,280
we added that uh of course if you want

820
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,879
all peers and we also have an identity

821
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,000
for that we change that from the

822
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,839
previous draft

823
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
and jeff mentioned

824
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
that oh

825
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,480
okay um next one please

826
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,119
so here's a brief example of how you can

827
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,200
you configure these bmp sources so for

828
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,839
instance here we want the data from the

829
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,000
global network instance as repeating pre

830
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,560
from the ipv4 address family and we want

831
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,880
that for all external peers so

832
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,599
in red is those points i apologize for

833
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,880
the xml this is what it is

834
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,040
okay

835
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,119
so some gaps we have we haven't we

836
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
haven't introduced initial initiation

837
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,359
delay and back of times which was um

838
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,400
an observation from from team evans

839
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
uh

840
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,119
we just haven't done it but we are not

841
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,520
we haven't forgotten it yet

842
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,760
and i'd first like to thank jimmy chen

843
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,599
i'm sorry i mispronounced his name we

844
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,720
had a very nice discussion about how to

845
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
uh about all of this that we just

846
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,079
discussed about bmp sources and being

847
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,160
able to filter the information the data

848
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,440
they really want to send to the

849
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,720
collector

850
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,400
he actually went a bit further and he

851
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,800
he told us that he actually needed to

852
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
filter prefixes per prefixes and he

853
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
actually told us we could use a specific

854
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,400
model

855
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,359
that allows you to basically

856
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,880
specify a a simple router routing policy

857
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,839
for that

858
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,920
so we we still we're still processing

859
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,079
that but it was an amazing conversation

860
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,839
and but right now we can just thank him

861
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,119
um

862
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,040
we better we were a bit ambiguous last

863
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
time uh we had some discussion in the

864
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,280
mailing list and it was not clear so now

865
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,599
i mean we'll just like to make it clear

866
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,280
is this good for work working group

867
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
adoption

868
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
we can take it to the mailing list but

869
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
we can also discuss it here a bit

870
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,040
and that's it any more feedback please

871
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,440
let me know

872
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
what tool chain do you use to compile

873
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,720
the yang

874
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,440
to compile it or to validate it or to

875
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,359
validate it but by yank

876
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,800
by yank and

877
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
some cisco tool that

878
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
for the example for validating the

879
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
example i use some cisco tool that is

880
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,079
free i don't remember the name sdnss

881
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,880
stuff

882
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,480
yeah

883
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,079
i'm asking because i believe this would

884
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,480
be the first young work in the grow

885
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
working group and they're

886
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,839
at least speaking for myself is a bit of

887
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,640
a lack of familiarity with the various

888
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,400
tools to interact with

889
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,079
young models in internet drafts

890
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
are there any questions from the working

891
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
group

892
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,200
um

893
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
ben madison thank you for doing this i

894
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
think this is really useful um

895
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,520
i think this is one of those areas where

896
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
interacting via a mailing list or

897
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,920
providing useful comments in a meeting

898
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
like this is is is difficult um

899
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,839
is this work available somewhere like

900
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,040
github or a similar service and if so is

901
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,480
that all kind of linked together from

902
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,400
data tracker so that it's easy to find

903
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
because i think that's going to be where

904
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,480
useful contributions happen

905
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
yeah we don't have it uh we have the

906
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
public but

907
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,079
we will do it and and of course there as

908
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,880
us

909
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,119
other itf uh models have been discussed

910
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,800
we can we can make them we can make them

911
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,240
public yet thank you that's the idea

912
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
more of a comment than a than a question

913
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,839
there is also the ietf young doctors who

914
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,119
are available to help with sort of

915
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
consulting and things like that on this

916
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
so if the working group has wants to

917
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
sort of get more experience or you know

918
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,640
understand how it works i think they'd

919
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,279
be happy to help

920
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,560
hello tom hill um i

921
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,079
believe

922
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,760
that there has been a suggestion within

923
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480
netmod to collate

924
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,520
um

925
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,280
to try and group together and bring

926
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
together all of the

927
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
distributed young models that are

928
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
developed in different working groups

929
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
into the same

930
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,599
netmod working group github repository

931
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,560
it's worth having a chat with um the

932
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,680
chairs of netmod slash

933
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,359
the ad for netmod rob wilton about that

934
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
that makes a lot of sense

935
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
and we will be also very happy to do it

936
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
after it gets working group adoption

937
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
because i guess that officializes the

938
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,480
whole thing right um more than just make

939
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,079
it like personal contribution

940
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,160
all right

941
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
we'll uh

942
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
launch a

943
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
mill thread to discuss working group

944
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,119
adoption of this work

945
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,000
and then assess consensus on how to

946
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
proceed

947
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,839
um

948
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,960
i see the queue is empty

949
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,680
both virtually and

950
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,079
physically so i think

951
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,040
you are

952
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,960
done thank you for your presentation

953
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,200
much appreciative

954
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,720
and i think with that we can wrap up

955
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,560
this ietf meetings grow session we are

956
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,520
giving you back 20 minutes of your life

957
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,520
and i hope to see all of you at ietf 115

958
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
in london

959
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,160
london is on a different continent than

960
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,680
the londons that are available

961
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,400
all right thank you all for attending

962
