I don't know

115
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,020
asking for a show of hands is the right

116
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,259
thing to do on who has read the draft

117
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,400
Dash 11

118

127
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,580
cool

128
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,600
um so just in case you've forgotten uh

129
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,080
where we've been since uh dash 10 went

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,280
to ITF last call uh so we had uh

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,060
21 GitHub issues created most were from

132
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,120
area review team reviewers

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
um

134
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,759
and uh very soon after that

135
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,199
we were on an isg ballot like the next

136
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,900
telechat

137
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,500
and we got two yes ballots which is and

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,720
10 no objection ballots which is not

139
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
surprising and uh one discuss ballot

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
which uh we can talk about in more

141
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,380
detail

142
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,539
um

143
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,160
that created nine GitHub issues

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,979
basically one per ad with comments or

145
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,699
discuss uh positions and um so actually

146
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,080
most of the comments that we've been

147
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,500
getting have been from the review teams

148
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,240
comments that uh we were still working

149
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
on when we hit the isg

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,220
uh total chat and a number of the

151
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,199
ballots on the ISD tells that were

152
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,259
please address the comments from my area

153
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,039
team reviewer so no surprise there so we

154
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,220
got Dash 11 uh submitted the last day

155
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
well basically as of the uh internet

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,039
draft cutoff so that's basically where

157
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
we've gotten on GitHub comment

158
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,940
resolution

159
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,900
we have

160
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,840
a few more a small number of issues that

161
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,039
have been addressed in GitHub dash 12 is

162
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,900
not submit been submitted yet because we

163
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,060
you know we submitted Dash 11 at the

164
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,759
beginning of the week and we have two

165
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,099
issues that remain open just from lack

166
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,440
of time to work on them I I don't think

167
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
either one of them are particularly big

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,020
and the editor's plan is to address the

169
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,360
two the last two issues and submit Dash

170
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,900
12.

171
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
I could stop for objections oh yeah you

172
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,419
didn't want me to Advance live

173
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,720
well I mean anything is fine you know

174
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,620
uh yeah go ahead and please yeah uh so

175
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,320
this is a high level description of what

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,620
changed between dash 10 and 11 and if

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,240
you bring up the

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,019
uh drafting the data tracker and look at

179
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,060
the diff from

180
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,839
H uh dashed into a dash 11.

181
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
um you'll see you'll see this

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,839
um

183
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,839
the two things that I think are worth

184
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,260
um mentioning are well the three things

185
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,080
are highlighted here either in what

186
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,100
started out as yellow or in uh purple

187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,260
text

188
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,300
so we synchronize the abstract and

189
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,180
introduction sections because our

190
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,459
intention was to keep these uh

191
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,380
keep these synchronized but we did have

192
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,540
a couple of changes that were made in

193
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,720
one place and not the other so that got

194
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,959
significantly better

195
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,640
we added a lot of definitions and

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,300
scoping text and honestly uh a

197
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,820
significant number of the the comments

198
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,839
that we got

199
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,120
uh familiar review teams and things like

200
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
that were I don't understand if this is

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
in scope for whatever the definition of

202
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,260
this is and part of that is because

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,880
um

204
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,860
they were asking about specific use

205
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,040
cases and so we were trying to make that

206
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,080
clearer

207
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,420
and you know one of the other things is

208
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,720
that we did have some text that seemed

209
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,600
helpful to say about RTP

210
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,320
but that took us a little bit out of the

211
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,579
general purpose streaming uh video and

212
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,360
media that we were talking about in most

213
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,279
of the document

214
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,339
um so that

215
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,399
we added some notes about video bit

216
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,620
rates and explaining what was going on

217
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,240
there or maybe a little bit better in

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
the section that talked about video bit

219
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,680
rates

220
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,200
um we had some questions we had some

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,079
comments about uh the definition of

222
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,120
Baseline for people who are monitoring

223
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,880
because our advice was to say notice

224
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,640
when things change from what you expect

225
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,899
to see

226
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,519
and

227
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
try to make it clear that we're not

228
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,680
thinking oh this is uh

229
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,959
constantly you know uh constant bitrate

230
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
video or anything like that you know so

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,980
you know we're expecting fluctuations

232
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,220
but if there's three times as much

233
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,320
traffic there today as you thought there

234
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,600
was yesterday uh that might be worth

235
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
knowing noticing

236
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,540
we cut a lot of the details about

237
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,079
unpredictable usage profiles to be

238
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
honest that this was something that God

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,380
added early in the draft and grew as

240
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,779
things went along

241
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,980
um we were you know we started out

242
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,480
talking I started out talking about uh

243
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,579
issues with sudden growth of

244
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,459
peer-to-peer networking in certain uh

245
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,579
access networks and things like that

246
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,839
um it grew to include observations about

247
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,060
the pandemic and things like that and

248
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,820
then it referenced the IAB Workshop

249
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,980
that was talking about the impact of

250
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,100
covet and things like that on networks

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,480
so we cut a lot at the early details out

252
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,100
and I think it's

253
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,740
I should say here and I should probably

254
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,100
say several times during the discussion

255
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,839
that uh the draft is better for these

256
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
comments

257
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,420
um

258
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,680
so that

259
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,959
we added some background about adaptive

260
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,240
bitrate streaming

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
um which

262
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
um

263
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,300
if you

264
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,880
if you're not coming at this from the

265
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,139
streaming streaming media Community

266
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,060
you may not have that background and we

267
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,579
were like I say we're just trying to

268
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,139
describe at a high level what adaptive

269
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,480
bitrite streaming is before we start

270
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,120
talking about its effects

271
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
we added uh competing goals text for

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,139
personalized ad insertion and this is

273
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:55,800
um

274
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,680
this was in response to Romans uh

275
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,779
discuss the only discussed belt that we

276
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,160
had

277
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,360
um and this the topic of personalized ad

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,139
insertion came up during the

279
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,579
sector review which was actually

280
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,940
submitted after the

281
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,220
isg telechat where this was valid and

282
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,440
that's fine

283
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,540
so like I say we were working on that

284
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,399
and we'll

285
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,300
um

286
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,579
I think I well I'll wait to give an

287
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:27,899
update on that until we get to the last

288
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,339
slide I think

289
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,639
I basically re so I basically rewrote

290
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,820
section six uh which was talking about

291
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,060
the effect of uh transport protocols and

292
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,579
I added the idea of media transport

293
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,680
protocols at the beginning at the

294
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,760
beginning of section six

295
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,779
um

296
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,860
we can talk about that but uh it seemed

297
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,480
like it seemed like a helpful thing to

298
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,300
me because we had protocols that might

299
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,860
be

300
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,240
um right underneath the media or it

301
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,220
might be underneath another protocol

302
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,339
that was right underneath media all the

303
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,459
way down so

304
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:14,100
trying to be clear about what the first

305
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,579
protocol was that was right underneath

306
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,160
media and a protocol stack and

307
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,980
everything else is what that's trying to

308
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,240
get at

309
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,940
we provided a number of clarifications

310
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,019
about media encryption about tunneling

311
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,839
and about vpns and about several other

312
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,880
things

313
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,459
and I think that's section seven

314
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,199
um

315
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,920
and uh we made so so so so many

316
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,560
additions in the acknowledgment session

317
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
uh the next slide is uh would would show

318
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,480
you what that looked like

319
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,440
so yeah

320
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,899
um we got comments and the you know if

321
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,220
the point was to get comments we got

322
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,199
comments and

323
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,040
um

324
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,800
these are the people who commented

325
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,060
um next slide please

326
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,740
so the editors take on the path forward

327
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,660
is to ask the working group to object to

328
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,939
any problematic changes soon

329
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
please pay special attention to the

330
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,759
changes that are in color on slide three

331
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,300
uh they are the they are the ones that

332
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,620
um

333
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,040
probably have the most likelihood of

334
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,440
surprising people in the working group

335
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,139
and then to address the last two issues

336
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,600
and submit-12

337
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
to ask Roman if we have addressed his

338
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,259
discussed comments

339
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,660
this is yeah Jake you want to say a word

340
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,079
about this

341
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,740
sure Jay Colin

342
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,519
uh yeah uh cornered Roman on his way out

343
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,380
uh the plenary yesterday or day before I

344
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,699
guess

345
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,560
uh he said that uh uh he's you know very

346
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,740
busy guy uh has had trouble uh wrapping

347
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,360
this up he got a little hung up because

348
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,060
he is trying to propose text

349
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,940
um there's like uh some subtle he wasn't

350
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,680
able to

351
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,019
uh cover he had lost contacts with some

352
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,579
of his other responsibilities at the

353
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,740
moment but he's uh working on some texts

354
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,120
that he wants to suggest for uh for

355
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,740
finishing up his discuss comments

356
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,100
so uh but he said

357
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,920
uh he thinks it's addressable and and is

358
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,660
uh trying to get there he said Eric's

359
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,759
been poking him every few days and doing

360
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,800
the right thing and he just hasn't quite

361
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
got to it yet so I'm anticipating

362
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,079
eagerly uh getting that wrap up

363
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
could we give a Short Round of Applause

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,679
for Eric uh cornering Robin

365
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,380
and uh one of the advantages of coming

366
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,079
to the ietf in person is that you can

367
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,619
actually Corner area directors between

368
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,299
uh the stage on West United and the

369
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,240
restrooms and bars

370
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
um

371
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,240
then asking Eric to approve dash 12 ish

372
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,360
and forward to the RFC editor

373
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
asking for your thoughts

374
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,980
um

375
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,260
I would ask the

376
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,120
chairs how you guys want to handle

377
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,100
discussion on this because this could be

378
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,919
really short or really long

379
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,620
in the rooming or are yeah I mean I mean

380
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,000
now yeah

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
so I would say that if there are any

382
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,080
comments or questions that in the room

383
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,400
it'd be good to at least surface them

384
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,020
now and we can see how long that will

385
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,559
actually take

386
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,419
it doesn't look like the caffeine has

387
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,520
hit the bloodstream yet

388
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,740
um I did make a note to send to the

389
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
mailing list to say to follow up your

390
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,000
particular points about checking the

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,919
document especially the

392
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,740
highlighted items in this slide deck

393
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,720
um

394
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,460
so if there aren't any other comments in

395
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,720
the room there will be another bite at

396
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,039
the Apple

397
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
on the mailing list to which I'm sure

398
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,780
you're all subscribed

399
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,400
because that would be the right thing to

400
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,660
do

401
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,500
um

402
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,520
actually so Kyle is presenting uh just

403
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,340
like I said the deaf between Dash 2 and

404
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,380
dash 11. and if you want to just kind of

405
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,080
fly through that at a relatively slow

406
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,320
rate uh we give up people ideas about

407
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
what changed and what didn't

408
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
so

409
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,460
um and like I said I because you can

410
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,679
just kind of slide through but there's a

411
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,880
there's a lot of text that did not

412
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,679
change it's not what he's showing right

413
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,860
now

414
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,120
um yeah see there's a lot of stuff that

415
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
didn't change

416
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,059
and there's there's some say there's a

417
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,100
lot of stuff that was deleted uh

418
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,320
especially the stuff in section six and

419
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,059
the stuff in

420
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:18,960
um

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,660
is that section three or four on uh

422
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
unpredictable usage profiles uh a lot of

423
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
deletions in both of those so like I

424
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
said there's there's

425
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,580
a significant number of words that

426
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,559
changed

427
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,240
um

428
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,179
almost all of these were done

429
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,160
in conjunction with

430
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,140
reviewers that I think there is I think

431
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,240
there's one isg member that I did not

432
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,840
have a GitHub uh

433
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,539
id4 and uh everybody else is tagged in

434
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,980
the conversation so uh it's not like uh

435
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,559
Jake and Ali and I went off in a corner

436
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,200
and just started typing but so this is

437
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,240
actually had eyes on it just maybe not

438
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,340
the working groups

439
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,980
Eric yeah Eric wink

440
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,679
as an Ade so thank you for all the

441
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,520
change

442
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,400
as you have seen on the diff yeah they

443
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,799
are not small change I've read to them

444
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,440
it's mostly editorial clarification so

445
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,179
that's not really deserve another last

446
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,520
call because you change nothing

447
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,080
substantial techniques to extension but

448
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,460
I would really encourage this working

449
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,919
group to review the document while we

450
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,840
still can change it to revert some

451
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,179
change sure sure yeah and like I said

452
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,539
we've still got two issues to resolve uh

453
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,179
better that are in GitHub

454
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,900
um Jake has started uh reminding me that

455
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,240
um at this point with the document

456
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,220
having left the working group we should

457
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,360
be trying to respond to comments uh

458
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,059
rather than trying to continue to evolve

459
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,799
the document so

460
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,440
um that is all he has also encouraged me

461
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,919
to behave and uh I'm doing my best to do

462
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,780
that as well

463
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,840
great thank you and thank all of your

464
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,580
co-authors as well

465
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,260
kind of thing that we've

466
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,880
gotten as far as we're going to this

467
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,059
morning in this room on this topic

468
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,880
looking around for disagreement

469
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
and and if we if we are bike shedding

470
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,380
word uh text in the document that may be

471
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,679
a Fine Place to to stop

472
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,080
yeah no I think as Eric said I think

473
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,419
it's been all Improvement so far so now

474
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,039
it's just to make sure that everybody's

475
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,140
had their opportunity to nod and then

476
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,080
we'll move on and declare victory

477
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,320
all right yeah thank you and uh thank

495

feedback in particular asking for

498
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,820
clarifications in the abstract and

499
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,559
introduction on the mailing list

500
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,480
yesterday

501
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,280
in the abstract we have added a couple

502
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,400
of lines the first line specifies that

503
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,280
we would want to discuss the expected

504
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,580
behavior of XR applications in terms of

505
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,799
the workload that a network operator can

506
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,700
expect in a use case such as ours

507
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,620
the next line specifies the service

508
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,840
requirements that the Exxon application

509
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
have in terms of the expected response

510
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,179
times throughput resource utilization

511
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,539
reliability and availability next slide

512
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,720
please

513
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,720
the updates in the abstract are further

514
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,419
elaborated in the introduction

515
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,260
sorry Leslie the previous slide for

516
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,559
slide four yeah

517
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,940
so the updates in the abstract are

518
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,500
further elaborated in the introduction

519
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,260
we point out that the XR traffics

520
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,960
workload on The Operators network will

521
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,059
have parameters that are heavy tailed

522
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,580
making it hard to predict the resources

523
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,760
that should be operationalized examples

524
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,039
of such parameters include the amount of

525
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,240
data carried in the connection

526
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
connection duration burst length idle

527
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
time Etc

528
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,240
secondly we point out that service

529
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,340
requirements of Exon applications will

530
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,159
have qoe factors such as the need to

531
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,080
avoid motion sickness that will be

532
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,360
unique to them next slide please

533
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,960
so uh Section 5 is where we propose to

534
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
elaborate on the abstract and

535
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,220
introduction if the working group agrees

536
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,039
section 5.1 will elaborate on the

537
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,320
problem of what the network operator can

538
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,919
expect in terms of arvr or XR traffic

539
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,860
workload to be able to make informed

540
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,200
decisions on resource deployment

541
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,900
section 5.2 will elaborate on the

542
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,240
problems of XR specific service

543
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,720
requirements such that QA factors like

544
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,240
motion sickness can be met by

545
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
appropriate provisioning of operational

546
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,720
resources

547
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,679
next slide please

548
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,260
so uh picking up the discussion from

549
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,360
itf113

550
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,900
we are trying to identify issues in XR

551
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,539
media delivery in an operational sense

552
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,760
that would be within the scope of the

553
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
mops working group and it would be great

554
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,960
to get some pointers from the working

555
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,039
group

556
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,740
so for example the first issue is

557
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,900
is offloading to the edge the only

558
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,059
solution to deal with the problems of

559
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,600
heat dissipation of the XR devices and

560
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,820
The Limited battery power as they run

561
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,220
computationally intensive tasks in our

562
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,539
use case

563
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,240
now our draft focuses on leveraging the

564
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,580
edge devices but we welcome inputs from

565
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,620
the working group that discuss other

566
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,140
pertinent operational ways that could be

567
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,640
Solutions

568
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,620
secondly for the edge Computing solution

569
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,059
for our use case what kinds of

570
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,640
underlying technology

571
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,179
do we envisage for example 5G or Wi-Fi

572
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,720
how will the XR media delivery scale if

573
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,539
we increase the number of users

574
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,360
how to ensure that the edge servers are

575
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,580
adequately provisioned for example how

576
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,559
many servers what topology to connect

577
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,840
them where to place them what capacity

578
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,299
to assign to the links Etc

579
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,960
uh how to migrate users XR media State

580
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,820
as they move

581
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,520
how to operationally respond to changes

582
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,980
in bandwidth creation and destruction of

583
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,020
logical associations between software

584
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,059
components Etc

585
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,279
this of course is not an exhaustive list

586
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,740
but we wish to prioritize the most

587
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,020
important issues that the working group

588
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,419
fields are appropriate for inclusion in

589
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,760
the draft and it would be great to have

590
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,740
everyone's feedback please

591
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,539
so with the chairs permission we'd like

592
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,919
to open the floor for a discussion

593
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,960
yes please I think uh I'll I'll give

594
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,140
people the opportunity to get in queue

595
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,000
um and appreciative people will use the

596
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,159
media Coq

597
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,320
um we had some good discussion around

598
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,039
this document uh at the last ietf

599
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,659
um and then we sort of foundered in

600
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,279
terms of follow-up on the list so I'd

601
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,840
like to make sure that we

602
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,659
that we take things in real time so go

603
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,020
ahead please

604
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,600
yeah you're good harina nice to meet you

605
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,459
again hi York how are you

606
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,080
um two two quick things

607
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,620
um on the one on on the one hand I would

608
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,720
have um I was I was reading through the

609
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,159
dot and I would have loved to see some

610
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,399
numbers

611
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,740
um we all know on ranges or typical

612
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,960
characteristics of

613
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,840
of AR traffic we all know that there's

614
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,580
many different flavors and resolutions

615
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,740
and whatnot but I think it would be

616
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,659
helpful to be more specific in these

617
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,760
cases because that ultimately also

618
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,640
governs what you can do

619
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,440
the other comment I wanted to make is

620
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
when is to the second to last bullet on

621
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,220
this slide here migrating state so we

622
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,299
probably want to have a careful

623
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,659
differentiation between systems aspects

624
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,580
um and the related protocol aspects I

625
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,000
would expect that's just a thought just

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,320
just food for thought thanks

627
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,600
yeah I agree with them they're really

628
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,059
good points in particular we are looking

629
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,220
for uh numbers for sure

630
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,120
Colin so uh Colin Jennings uh I'm with

631
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,760
Cisco and I don't normally talk about uh

632
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,559
Cisco products but we talk about just

633
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,299
briefly here in the context of providing

634
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,620
you some numbers to try and answer that

635
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,299
question so it's a product called WebEx

636
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,899
hologram it records me as a or records a

637
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:32,580
user with a set of light field cameras

638
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,320
as a light field transmits it up to the

639
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,440
cloud transmits it down to an AR headset

640
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,779
and then uh you see the person sitting

641
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,880
across the table from you as an AR

642
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,740
hologram and it's a it's a very

643
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,299
photorealistic system if you want to see

644
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,860
videos of it you know Google WebEx

645
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,600
hologram it's it's shipping to customers

646
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,039
now so uh in the context of that uh

647
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,899
there are you know I have specific

648
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,460
numbers of what of what we're doing on

649
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,720
that we can share some of those now I'll

650
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,279
share some of those in a minute

651
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,640
um but there are uh you know we've we've

652
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,380
watched and followed what a lot of

653
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,720
different uh vendors are doing in this

654
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,820
space and I think this draft would

655
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,320
benefit by

656
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
talking about a little like I I think

657
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,279
that now the industry's evolved enough

658
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,840
that you can start talking about more

659
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,700
details on how this works

660
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,880
um so there are three major ways that we

661
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,320
see this type of uh a XR based

662
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,419
images and data coming across the

663
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,340
network uh and different vendors have

664
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,440
taken very different approaches to it I

665
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,700
would say a bunch of vendors have gone

666
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,860
down the texture mapped polygon approach

667
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,360
so what they're sending is you know a

668
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,919
bunch of polygons in the texture maps

669
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,000
for them and the texture maps are

670
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,320
updating with the video stream and the

671
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
polygons are updating with some mesh

672
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,179
data uh and that's a that's that's one

673
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,340
representation we see widely used

674
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,980
we see a representation widely used as

675
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,299
Point clouds where you're basically

676
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,460
sending a bunch of teeny points a huge

677
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,620
cloud of them each point has a color you

678
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,880
can think of it as a little teeny

679
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,279
colored sphere when you render it and it

680
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,860
results up that has a different data

681
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,539
characteristic so both of those have

682
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,740
very different bandwidth and data

683
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,240
cursors and then the third one that we

684
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,460
use that's very popular magically Cisco

685
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,679
some others uh is this light field

686
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,020
approach where uh with the light field

687
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,820
you can think of it as almost sort of

688
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,380
You Know five-dimensional video or

689
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,720
something like that but it is um we're

690
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,600
trying to send the color of every ray of

691
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,039
light going through every point in the

692
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,899
room in every different direction and

693
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,640
you might be like that's and so it's

694
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
that's the field is this

695
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,580
five-dimensional field and you compress

696
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,080
it very much like you compress video

697
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,120
everybody takes an existing video

698
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,240
standard and extends it to do the

699
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,480
multi-dimensional slicing approach uh so

700
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,980
the

701
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,539
um so I think the interesting thing on

702
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,100
these numbers is so since we're talking

703
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,240
using the light Fields I'm going to talk

704
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,919
about numbers in that space

705
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,539
you might think that that's a huge

706
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,799
amount of data this five-dimensional

707
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,640
space

708
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,380
it actually has an incredible amount of

709
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,419
redundancy in it so it compresses

710
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,940
incredibly well we're seeing it use

711
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,399
about 10x more than the standard video

712
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,799
so as a very specific number of what our

713
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,600
system is using today we're using about

714
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,200
30 megabits per second uh Upstream of

715
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360
recording the light field of a whole uh

716
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,980
the whole image of the scene and setting

717
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,559
it up that's a very specific metric

718
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,200
um now on the downstream you don't need

719
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
to send anywhere near as much data that

720
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,100
you're sending to the headset because

721
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,779
you can you the headset has a very

722
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,580
localized point of view and you only

723
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,260
need a small portion of the light field

724
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,299
to make to cover everywhere that the

725
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,919
person can move that you need to display

726
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,960
in any reasonable amount of time of

727
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,220
course you've got to be able to keep

728
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,260
updating where the user's head is so you

729
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,360
can change where that is but that

730
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,519
reduced light field

731
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,620
um it where we're seeing it at about 2x

732
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,720
what the typical video of a relative

733
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,519
thing is so there we're using about six

734
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,559
megabits per second is is what we use on

735
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,380
a download there now on the latencies of

736
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,940
these things I think the draft gets

737
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,860
really a lot of the latencies and power

738
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,779
and you know those types of things uh

739
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,140
very right uh however I think that it

740
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,480
sort of occasionally confuses the issue

741
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,019
of what the update rate is like hey the

742
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,220
screen's going to update every 15

743
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,340
milliseconds or um with we need that

744
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,960
much time to update the screen you don't

745
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,880
you just need to time your other updates

746
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
with that so a lot of the latencies

747
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,320
aren't actually as bad as they sound in

748
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,179
the draft because you can overlap things

749
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,059
in certain ways that make this easier

750
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,220
um the system that we're doing has a you

751
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,659
know end-to-end latencies that are

752
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,340
comparable to video conferencing systems

753
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,380
because it's very similar it goes you

754
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,740
know up to a cloud running on AWS and

755
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,960
then back down to an end user it will

756
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,059
run today over uh you know we'll run it

757
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,559
over LTE actually you don't actually

758
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,600
really need 5G to make this work which

759
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,279
is you know that's our experience anyway

760
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
uh now some of the latencies uh the the

761
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,679
latency is about the motion sickness and

762
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,480
everything is very real you have to keep

763
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
that well under you know the sort of 12

764
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,559
milliseconds that you you expressed in

765
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,600
there but that's why people are doing

766
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,519
all the compute on the head and the

767
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,260
compute and battery power was a real

768
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,179
issue to start with

769
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,000
but as each evolution of headset and

770
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,919
processors come out it's way less of a

771
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,899
problem on any of the the latest

772
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,600
generation of headsets uh so if you look

773
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,600
at a magically two headset uh it is just

774
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,279
it's a phenomenally better situation

775
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,260
than it was now of course everybody

776
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,880
wants to make the headset smaller and

777
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,380
lighter and less battery so I'm not

778
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,700
saying that that isn't a constant

779
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,100
problem it always is but they won't be

780
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,740
sort of uh changing up so I hope that

781
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,360
helps with numbers a little bit

782
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,340
I and I'm glad to discuss any more with

783
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,559
those with anybody who's interested uh

784
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,419
one bit of detail in the draft that

785
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,980
seemed wrong to me and I sorry I didn't

786
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,440
send an email on this but it mentions

787
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,200
this zero point that that three that the

788
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,539
five some of the three gpp specs are are

789
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,179
it's reliability one and reliability two

790
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,679
references say that they're going to do

791
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,919
like five nines over 0.5 milliseconds

792
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,779
I mean that's only 150 meters at the

793
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,940
speed of light I find that very hard to

794
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,320
believe and when I went and read those

795
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,179
specs I couldn't find any reference to

796
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,880
those so I suspect that those may have

797
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,260
been there at one point in time but the

798
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,399
latest version of the specs may have

799
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,200
moved them out so I think that we should

800
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
I I think there's a lot of things in

801
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,520
this draft that come from things

802
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,339
5G might have hoped could be true but

803
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,839
not things that they were promising and

804
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,918
the draft might confuse them a little

805
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,300
bit we might just need to like really

806
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,859
scan through all the numbers in the

807
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,119
draft and make sure they actually check

808
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,440
with the references I think some of them

809
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,300
are maybe have become a little dated or

810
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,859
a little bit off

811
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,139
um yeah let me stop there thank you

812
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,139
so and uh kicker points regarding the

813
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,820
3gpp reference I'll check the numbers

814
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,440
again

815
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,000
um and you've made fantastic points

816
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,760
about the various devices that are

817
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,119
available one question I had was uh have

818
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,918
these devices been tested in outdoor

819
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,839
environments where let's say there are

820
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,359
clouds and and the the light is changing

821
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,739
and those kinds of scenarios

822
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,739
um

823
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:55,440
they uh so they have not been so I was

824
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,180
speaking only for the work I've done is

825
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,339
and not been tested in in super outdoor

826
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,320
environments but it has been done in

827
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,480
classic video con like in in office

828
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,400
rooms with like Windows All Along The

829
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Far Side where you have changing Cloud

830
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
lighting and lots of stuff like that you

831
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
can have very flexible you know very

832
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,940
diverse lighting and it still works

833
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,800
quite well but that's an advantage of

834
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,660
the light field approach I think as you

835
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,940
move to the

836
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,740
um the polygon and the texture mapping

837
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,839
approaches it's really all about your

838
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,700
ability and look I've done a lot of work

839
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,900
on both of those we've tried all three

840
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,220
of these brooches before we went forward

841
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,700
whether we did uh I I think that you end

842
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,740
up with uh how good your depth map

843
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,440
recovery is and obviously depth map

844
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,180
recovery I've seen people obviously

845
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,040
people are doing good depth map recovery

846
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,680
on outdoor scenes but it's a lot harder

847
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,240
than doing on a controlled lighting type

848
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,060
environment uh so I think I I think it's

849
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,500
one of those still you know your mileage

850
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,180
varies widely and you get better depth

851
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,380
and apps with more controlled lighting

852
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,640
if you go down that approach the light

853
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,960
field approach you're just capturing the

854
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,220
color of the light in the room and it's

855
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,800
like you know it's it's less dependent

856
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,220
on uh clouds or fans spinning lights or

857
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,540
those types of things in some other

858
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,160
systems

859
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,460
okay great thanks

860
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,020
Colin and and I guess

861
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,839
um one observation is that probably

862
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,280
um renan you're gonna have to go through

863
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,540
the recording of this session if you

864
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,740
didn't catch all that real time because

865
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,119
I get the sense that there is an awful

866
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,220
lot of depth of comment and what Colin

867
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,780
had to say one specific question to

868
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,359
Cullen are you suggesting that the

869
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
document tees out the separate types of

870
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,220
XR the I mean

871
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,740
the polygons versus raster versus

872
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,200
streaming yeah yeah I would and I'd be

873
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,900
I'd be happy to help review as it goes

874
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,579
along but I think that that is the

875
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,440
reality of what's happening in the

876
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,660
marketplace now and that people like

877
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,280
maybe there's some other techniques out

878
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,920
of those three but I would say that 95

879
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
of the companies work in this space and

880
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,800
there are a credible number of companies

881
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,000
working in this space particularly given

882
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,740
the number of people in this room

883
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,780
um are using one of those three I mean

884
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,940
it's certainly you know the the vast

885
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,079
majority

886
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,640
um and I think that talking about that

887
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,740
makes it easier to understand why you're

888
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,660
seeing such different numbers from

889
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,280
different people and it has to do with

890
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,599
those techniques

891
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,400
great thanks Spencer

892
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,359
um

893
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,359
so I'm getting up here to agree with uh

894
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,460
everything Cohen said

895
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,000
um

896
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,839
but I I did want to to uh thank the

897
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,200
authors for uh their continued sense of

898
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,099
humor

899
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,300
um

900
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,460
hanging with this draft I think uh

901
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,760
Leslie was exactly right that we had

902
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,160
um

903
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,680
you know the the what we're trying to

904
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,140
describe is getting to closer to the

905
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,320
maturity level that we actually could

906
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,140
describe it and uh so I think that I

907
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,060
think that this is a good time for us to

908
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,940
push a bit further

909
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,940
um I would say you know you'd notice

910
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,619
that in the uh opscom draft the uh one

911
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,119
of the uh

912
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,000
one of the bigger changes that was there

913
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
was our description of uh video bit

914
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,980
rights and and things like you know and

915
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,800
character characterizing those I think

916
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,720
that that's a really good model to

917
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,680
include in uh the in the uh in your

918
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,000
draft as well

919
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,460
and uh I'm sorry

920
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,320
okay and uh the the last thing the last

921
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,500
thing I would say uh

922
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,140
the there is nothing that will help

923
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,420
people

924
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,540
contribute numbers as much as putting in

925
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,579
one set of numbers

926
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,079
and letting and letting Leslie and Kyle

927
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,180
shop those numbers around and say is

928
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,060
this what is this what you're seeing and

929
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,560
if that you know if you've got that in

930
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,079
the draft it really makes it easier for

931
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,599
the chairs to make progress in my

932
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,800
opinion thank you

933
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,220
great points Spencer I agree with them

934
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,579
great thanks so

935
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,740
um yeah Kyle has taken himself out of

936
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,599
queue and he's also locked the queue

937
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,220
because we're targeting terminating this

938
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,520
this section around quarter two but

939
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,240
go ahead MO uh mosinati one one thing

940
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,880
that um uh confused me when reading the

941
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,520
draft was uh the the use case that was

942
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,560
presented uh seemed like it was trying

943
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,500
to be representative of of most

944
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,839
um you know most popular use cases and

945
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,900
then derived some requirements and and

946
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,839
and and and conclusions from that and I

947
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,040
don't think it really is very

948
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,480
representative as what Colin just

949
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,520
described very very different that what

950
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
the way that the draft describes the

951
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,780
rendering of of uh scenes and images is

952
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,980
very very different than the system that

953
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,780
Cohen described which I'm I'm familiar

954
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,660
with and even even that system has

955
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,480
morphed many times and will morph many

956
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,160
more times that I don't think the draft

957
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,500
could accurately capture all those

958
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,240
permutations a better starting point

959
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,300
would be to look at how game developers

960
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,560
the most popular game developers

961
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,480
actually render things because that's

962
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,420
more likely how most XR applications are

963
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,099
going to be architecting their their

964
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,079
entire solution from what's being done

965
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,180
locally on device to what's being done

966
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,160
Cloud processing and what's trying to

967
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,920
offload somewhere in Edge in between and

968
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,240
if you look at the things that really

969
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,579
matter you should look at what matters

970
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,800
to the local devices should look at what

971
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,000
what the trends are on the local device

972
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,319
and how that's dictating Network

973
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,260
requirements and the the typical Trends

974
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,660
are increased frame rates you're getting

975
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,640
refresh rates of around 120 hertz on all

976
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,619
new devices so that's eight millisecond

977
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,440
refresh and it's unlikely that a lot of

978
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,920
edge cases are going to allow eight

979
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,660
millisecond round trip with processing

980
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,319
involved in everything so you need to be

981
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
cognizant of what the real Trends here

982
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,560
are and that would be more useful to

983
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,839
document than this um this I think kind

984
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,240
of contrived use case that is deriving

985
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,980
the other things that that the draft

986
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,780
thinks are relevant

987
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,420
are you basically arguing that

988
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,400
um that there's sort of a minimum viable

989
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,319
amount of computing required locally

990
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,400
um to you know in order to make XR

991
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,960
viable against motion sickness Etc

992
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm arguing that the draft should look

993
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,400
at what the trends are in the industry

994
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,220
and what matters to the XR experience

995
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,900
and then look at the leading

996
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,760
applications that are that are driving

997
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,800
this and it's it's mostly gaming so

998
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,819
sorry I guess I didn't mean if that was

999
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,500
what you were arguing I mean is that

1000
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,240
kind of an example of the sort of thing

1001
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,220
that you're okay that that is driving

1002
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,078
those concerns yes yes

1003
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,800
okay thanks now Colin was in queue his

1004
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,839
left cue we still have a few minutes

1005
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,240
left if anybody else wants to

1006
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,740
uh

1007
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,480
add anything

1008
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
today

1009
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,939
I'm not seeing anybody rush to the queue

1010
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,480
okay thank you very much Serena

1011
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,180
um and so I'd ask you also to note that

1012
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,220
Sanjay Mishra did send some comments on

1013
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,579
the mailing list recently so

1014
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,079
um I think that gives plenty to follow

1015
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,240
up

1016
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,700
thanks everyone

1017
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,980
thanks

1018
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,040
okay so then next up

1019
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,099
um

1020
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,140
we are switching over to related ietf

1021
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,700
work and we have a report from the

1022
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,920
hackathon which I believe Jake is going

1023
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,160
to do

1024
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,220
foreign

1025
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,859
so we were working on uh a uh so we have

1026
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,800
a a multicast quick draft uh we

1027
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,500
presented it that in about that in the

1028
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,940
quick working group

1029
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,800
um hopefully we'll get some discussion

1030
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,700
there

1031
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,560
uh we were working on an implementation

1032
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,720
at the hackathon uh that is still in

1033
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,579
progress I think we're uh we're making

1034
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,680
good progress we believe it to be

1035
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,200
possible and we've learned some some

1036
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,579
good things that have gone into updates

1037
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,200
uh to the draft that we've made so far

1038
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,140
uh we've been looking toward

1039
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,920
um

1040
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,920
thanks to Luke uh I think he's here

1041
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,260
about the uh warp server he's posted I

1042
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,880
think that would be

1043
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,460
a really good place for us to to go with

1044
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,160
that because it's the the quick

1045
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,079
multicaster after relies on server

1046
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,060
initiated data and warp uses the

1047
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,680
server-initiated data in such a way that

1048
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,359
we think we might be able to apply it

1049
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,380
and

1050
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,660
uh that will be way better than writing

1051
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,660
our own uh player also

1052
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,260
um so we're uh we're hoping to have

1053
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,720
you know some some useful demo running

1054
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,700
at some point we've been working on it

1055
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,440
in the uh

1056
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,440
uh w3c multicast community group that

1057
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,500
meets uh well the working team for

1058
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,660
that's been waking meeting weekly if

1059
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,180
anybody wants to join in uh but we we

1060
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,460
also meet monthly uh just online so you

1061
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,079
can check the uh

1062
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,880
check that out anybody that wants to get

1063
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,579
in involved in that

1064
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,700
um and uh

1065
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,040
is there anything else like it's I I

1066
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
would say it's not done yet I wish it

1067
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,619
was further along of course uh but uh uh

1068
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,380
it's coming along we're

1069
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,359
hopeful that this is actually a

1070
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,520
plausible thing to do

1071
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,260
um we just don't have it actually run

1072
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,180
again

1073
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,300
uh any questions anybody wanted yeah I

1074
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,319
would ask if there were any questions

1075
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,900
and I would ask you if this is something

1076
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,819
that you anticipate working on for

1077
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,819
instance at the hackathon in November or

1078
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,800
or is it all gonna be done by then

1079
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,380
uh yeah it depends where it is I don't

1080
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,900
imagine everything will be done by then

1081
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,720
um like in my perfect world we'll be

1082
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,000
like debugging ABR issues at that point

1083
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,980
or something uh rather than trying to

1084
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,900
get the basic functionality running

1085
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,260
uh but yeah we so we got the draft

1086
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,540
up in maybe uh

1087
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,940
May or so I think

1088
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,760
and then uh and then we've been like uh

1089
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,619
hammering out you know bits and pieces

1090
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,839
of that kind of as time permits I think

1091
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,839
none of us are are uh

1092
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,540
this is our main project but um we would

1093
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,160
all like to see it work that I've been

1094
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,819
working on so uh we've been hacking on

1095
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,440
it when we can and uh

1096
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,060
it's not primarily a you know a media

1097
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,680
thing necessarily

1098
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,960
uh but I mean that's the use case that I

1099
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,119
have mostly so

1100
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,880
uh so that's what I'm I'm trying to hit

1101
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,740
a demo that will that will be able to do

1102
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,000
that right

1103
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
great so with that by way of Eric cover

1104
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,900
any any questions

1105
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,440
thank you Jake

1106
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,140
all right uh other ietf work going on

1107
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,660
there is a media over quick buff this

1108
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,240
week which I'm sure many of you are also

1109
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,380
at

1110
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,180
um but Ted Hardy is here to give us a

1111
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,220
brief overview of how that went down Ted

1112
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,220
uh Howdy Folks uh thanks very much for

1113
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,980
uh the time today uh so the this was

1114
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,420
actually the second buff there was a

1115
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,040
previous off

1116
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,260
um that discussed the idea of forming

1117
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,940
this and the on the mailing list has

1118
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,460
been around for a while uh so as a

1119
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,319
second boss that was very much focused

1120
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,380
on the the chartering aspect of the

1121
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,319
discussion uh so almost all of the time

1122
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,260
was taken uh going through uh the

1123
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,940
charter and getting various improvements

1124
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,579
made into it I've just put a link to the

1125
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,579
uh the GitHub uh repo where the charter

1126
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,500
is with the current state of the charter

1127
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,079
um one of the changes uh suggested in

1128
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,300
the room and adopted in the room uh was

1129
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,960
to make sure that moq

1130
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,079
did a liaison with mops and so that and

1131
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,420
a couple of other

1132
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,300
um kind of key changes went in uh as a

1133
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,300
result of the interventions in the room

1134
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,000
if you go and look at the history for

1135
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,280
July 27th you'll see all the ones that

1136
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,740
kind of went in at that at that date are

1137
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,960
the ones that came as a result of the of

1138
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,160
the discussion

1139
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,380
uh we then went through uh the buff

1140
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,180
questions and there was uh generally

1141
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,579
speaking uh

1142
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,440
uh quite strong

1143
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,059
um agreement that forming a working

1144
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:46,200
group based on the the recently changed

1145
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,059
Charter uh was a good idea there are

1146
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:49,440
still a couple of

1147
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,480
uh issues that were unresolved in the

1148
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,740
discussion and that will need to be

1149
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,020
resolved as it goes through the iasg

1150
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,640
process

1151
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,980
um but uh I think we're anticipating

1152
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,020
that the iesg will will take it to the

1153
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,280
broader Community for commentary

1154
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,180
relatively soon

1155
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,740
and I do see quite a few people in the

1156
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,660
room there that were also in that room

1157
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,579
if they want to uh to give their own

1158
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:12,780
Impressions or if they want to make

1159
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,319
Corrections

1160
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,579
well people are thinking about that I

1161
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:21,980
see that glendine is in the queue Glenn

1162
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,500
hey hey on here I'm clicking buttons and

1163
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,559
like hey so I'm going up here for live

1164
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,380
video for like at one moment for the

1165
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,099
entire ITF this week so hello everybody

1166
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,619
um Ted hey I'm I'm glad we got that

1167
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,079
connection established between Mock and

1168
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,420
uh mops and I think that's a really good

1169
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,559
thing

1170
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,500
sort of any thoughts on how we make that

1171
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,020
sort of move Beyond like into reality

1172
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,700
versus like hey let's put this in the in

1173
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,859
a charter any thoughts about how

1174
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,359
operationally we might make that really

1175
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:01,800
working well

1176
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,720
because a big part of mops as you know

1177
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,720
is to bring in Industry engagement

1178
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,059
um one of the things I see in the mock

1179
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:12,660
work that worries me a little bit is

1180
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,280
that there's some industry engagement

1181
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,079
but I like to see more industry

1182
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,700
engagements especially from professional

1183
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,940
media delivery and creation

1184
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,220
um and so how do we do it even better

1185
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,180
any thoughts

1186
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,720
um I think it's it's always a little bit

1187
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,059
easier one so uh group has been formed

1188
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,559
to convince people that it's worth their

1189
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:32,819
time

1190
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,260
um well something's still in the mailing

1191
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,880
list stage I think it's it's always a

1192
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,380
little bit harder to say hey you should

1193
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,900
be watching this as it as it comes into

1194
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,859
Focus

1195
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,619
um so I'm hopeful that we will get some

1196
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,020
increased engagement simply from having

1197
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,660
a charter uh approved and people knowing

1198
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,040
that we're working on

1199
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,839
uh the protocol mechanics and state

1200
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,240
machine and all of that I do agree with

1201
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,180
you that a lot of what we have right now

1202
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,940
are people who are very familiar uh with

1203
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,920
the networking side and maybe not as

1204
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,540
familiar

1205
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,680
um with

1206
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,619
um the operation side or with uh the

1207
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,059
aspects of the

1208
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,280
media creation

1209
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
um for those those parts of the charter

1210
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,099
which are focused on on streaming so I

1211
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,099
do hope that some of the folks who do

1212
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,740
have those connections can help them

1213
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,839
bring a friend so to speak

1214
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,359
um and and go there I also anticipate

1215
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,880
that um now that we we've established

1216
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,440
that there needs to be a connection here

1217
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,079
uh that a regular Cadence of making sure

1218
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,079
that uh mops is invited to any moq

1219
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,319
interims or uh knows about uh kind of

1220
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,300
the Milestones uh that we're hitting

1221
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,640
that are maybe not the big level of

1222
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,859
Milestones of

1223
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,599
um you know sending something to the

1224
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,579
iesg but oh by the way there is an

1225
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,319
update to this document if you're not on

1226
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,319
the list uh you might want to take a um

1227
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,359
take a squint at it as it does change

1228
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,160
some things that may may be of interest

1229
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,720
so

1230
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,000
um that that's really

1231
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,920
um

1232
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,079
the usual mechanics that you get in the

1233
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,500
ITF when there's a fair amount of shared

1234
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,160
membership

1235
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,680
um and I'm I'm not really

1236
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,400
um thinking at this point that would

1237
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,160
make a big push out into

1238
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,500
um into the into the broader industry

1239
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,480
but if you think that's valuable and

1240
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,579
have ideas of how to do that please do

1241
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,740
at this point let the area directors

1242
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,559
know uh because it's still in their

1243
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,520
hands

1244
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,740
well I think you know part of and this

1245
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,059
is where the link is between Mock and

1246
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,559
mops really could work really well for

1247
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,540
everybody because part of the mission of

1248
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,880
mops is that industry linkage right

1249
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,880
trying to draw people in and so I mean

1250
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,440
the first place I sort of see a real

1251
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,960
opportunity here is when uh mock hits

1252
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,180
use case

1253
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,859
use cases are what really drives

1254
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,200
comments from the broader audience and

1255
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,640
so maybe you know us in here over here

1256
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,800
at mobs getting stuff from the mock

1257
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,480
flowing in when that happens and then be

1258
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,339
able to amplify that message out and

1259
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,260
follow it back over would be something

1260
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,000
we can do together but I'm looking

1261
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,920
forward to working together

1262
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,619
great uh thanks very much I I I'm glad

1263
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:14,880
to hear that

1264
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,440
um and I guess one of the things we

1265
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,240
mentioned in the room just because we

1266
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,980
didn't get to any technical uh

1267
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,839
presentations or conversation

1268
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,079
uh is that we may in fact try and hold

1269
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,900
um uh some sort of interim

1270
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,319
um between now and itf-115 just to make

1271
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:34,319
sure that people who have who have been

1272
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,839
working on the technical aspects of moq

1273
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,000
for a while uh get a chance to share

1274
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,859
their thoughts and of course uh we'll

1275
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,800
make sure that when that gets discussed

1276
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,839
it uh that mops is is involved in

1277
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:50,400
um understands when it's going to happen

1278
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,319
or or

1279
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,380
the the logistics there too

1280
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,660
about just before I go is the thought

1281
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,839
Ted to make that interim hybrid or in

1282
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:02,040
person

1283
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,740
a lot of it depends on how fast the isg

1284
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,720
goes through the rest of the processing

1285
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,920
and what the comments are from the

1286
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,400
broader community so if if the isg and

1287
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,020
the broader Community say yeah this all

1288
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,440
looks good and we're we're ready to

1289
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,440
um to hold something that could be

1290
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,760
hybrid in let's say uh September uh then

1291
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,520
I think uh hybrid would be the right way

1292
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,380
to go because there's there's obviously

1293
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,359
a lot of energy you get when people can

1294
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,220
share

1295
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,099
um can share their ideas in real time in

1296
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,040
in a space

1297
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,599
the current reality is any any such

1298
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,400
meeting will obviously also have a

1299
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,300
remote uh uh component I mean just we're

1300
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,480
we're not at as at a situation uh either

1301
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,700
for travel for a variety of reasons or

1302
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,140
for um

1303
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,619
uh for covet to really rule that out

1304
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:56,760
um but I think

1305
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,619
um if it if it takes a little bit longer

1306
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,400
you know if August turns into kind of

1307
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,260
um a time when very little goes on and

1308
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,900
it re the the ASG processing and Etc

1309
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,359
goes on mostly in September then we

1310
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,220
definitely be looking at uh at remote

1311
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,200
just to make sure that we would be able

1312
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,819
to um get the uh the advantage of the

1313
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,980
quicker Logistics

1314
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,020
um so that that turns into time zone

1315
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,520
math more than any other kind of

1316
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,800
logistics and that's a little it's never

1317
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,540
easy but it's a little bit easier than

1318
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,700
adding time zone math to

1319
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,920
you know finding a hotel and and making

1320
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,839
venue arrangements and doing all of that

1321
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,220
other stuff

1322
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,040
if I can put one idea out there

1323
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,880
um

1324
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,720
in order to help connect with industry

1325
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,920
um one of the things that might be good

1326
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,900
also is to be sensitive to Industry

1327
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,420
events we say September I'll point out

1328
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,240
that IBC happens in September it's a

1329
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,099
very big industry event and basically

1330
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:54,720
people disappear for about a week and a

1331
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,819
half during it so if they if there was

1332
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,500
overlap the ability to get industry

1333
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,020
engagement might be very difficult

1334
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,839
um during that window just FYI

1335
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,180
okay is is it something where people do

1336
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,740
things at the front and back of it

1337
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,559
though

1338
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,819
it might be useful

1339
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:14,880
sometimes I mean it starts just after

1340
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,500
Labor Day so like I think it's like

1341
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,119
September

1342
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:20,400
10th or 11th because Labor Day is late

1343
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,440
this year and then runs over the weekend

1344
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,720
typically into into the next week so

1345
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,880
typically people do run things back on

1346
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,000
either side it depends upon the year uh

1347
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
and other events that are taking place

1348
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,339
and sometimes hallways so it gets very

1349
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:36,660
complicated sometimes a complicated

1350
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,420
month okay and and obviously it would be

1351
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,460
very quick work to try and get a uh

1352
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,420
something

1353
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,640
uh pulled together for an interim right

1354
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,160
right around Labor Day if if it was

1355
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,660
September it's more likely to be later

1356
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,819
but if you wouldn't mind sending the uh

1357
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:54,480
the details on CC Allen uh I will make

1358
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,720
sure that uh the the area directors get

1359
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,579
a get a hold of those

1360
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,339
um if we do ask them for an inter

1361
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,980
meeting because we we can obviously also

1362
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,220
just hold a meeting without it being a

1363
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,799
full ITF meeting uh if if they haven't

1364
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,119
gone through the whole process but I'd

1365
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,619
much prefer to do everything under note

1366
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,359
well from the beginning and get all that

1367
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,680
settled

1368
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,140
um so uh that would be the intent if we

1369
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,299
can do it

1370
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:24,059
great thank you

1371
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:25,200
um I think it's time to move along on

1372
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,839
the Queue and uh Spencer

1373
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,920
yeah

1374
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,900
um

1375
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,059
so Spencer Dawkins and I just wanted to

1376
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,640
do a couple of things one was to say

1377
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,000
very clearly uh at a microphone that I

1378
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,599
thought the mock off went very well and

1379
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,119
uh appreciated very much Ted and Allen

1380
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,540
and the mock Community for that

1381
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,760
um a thing I would mention I was just

1382
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,480
following up for uh Glenn uh as he's

1383
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,099
thinking about

1384
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:58,200
how to talk

1385
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,540
through the uh

1386
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,700
through you know through the through the

1387
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,660
pathway to other uh operator forums and

1388
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,299
things like that is to say is to say

1389
00:57:09,299 --> 00:57:10,859
that the

1390
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:12,599
Charter the last time I looked at it

1391
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,079
does have a requirements draft listed

1392
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,280
there and uh at any point the that might

1393
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,520
be very interesting for the uh operator

1394
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,680
Community to take a look at at the

1395
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,299
appropriate time

1396
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:30,079
thank you

1397
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,099
thank you Ted you might want to respond

1398
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:40,559
uh no it was actually gonna see if I

1399
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,299
could look at the Milestones quickly so

1400
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:44,160
I just flipped to the other window uh

1401
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,700
just to see if I could look at the set

1402
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,619
of deliverables to make sure

1403
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:53,160
uh that I could give the name to that

1404
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,020
um there's an architecture specification

1405
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,640
and a working group adoption of use

1406
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,099
cases and requirements uh for media

1407
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:00,720
delivery over quick and I think that's

1408
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,680
the the one that would uh map to what uh

1409
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,420
yeah Spencer is agreeing with that

1410
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,059
Spencer Spencer was looking at so um

1411
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,119
that's definitely in in the um in the

1412
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,520
charter now I I would be a bit surprised

1413
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,660
to see the uh isg cut it in their um in

1414
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,640
their analysis of the charter but uh

1415
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,220
we'll have to see I've been surprised so

1416
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,020
many times over the past few years I

1417
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,960
just don't rule it out anymore

1418
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,520
great thanks Helen

1419
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,140
Collins I just wanted to respond to a

1420
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,859
little bit more uh data to Glenn uh I I

1421
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,480
mean it would it would definitely be

1422
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,880
great to see uh I I think there are some

1423
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,140
people I want to talk about them in a

1424
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,000
second that are operating large video

1425
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,280
networks um that are very involved with

1426
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,960
with the mock stuff I'll talk about that

1427
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,940
in a sec but it would be obviously great

1428
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,740
to have more and it would have great to

1429
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,200
have somebody like BBC or that class of

1430
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,760
development system involved though I'm

1431
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,380
not sure it's very relevant to that

1432
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,960
stuff which is why we haven't seen that

1433
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,460
group they already have good solutions

1434
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,619
to most of their problems so but still

1435
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,240
it'd be good to hear more from that sort

1436
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,819
of classic group but I mean uh you know

1437
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:10,680
there's three proposals right now in

1438
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,920
that draft in that or being proposed

1439
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,420
into that working group right now you

1440
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,920
know one from WebEx which is doing a

1441
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,660
billion minutes a day which is a drop in

1442
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,460
the bucket compared to what meta is

1443
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,740
doing meta looks I couldn't find recent

1444
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,780
numbers for them but several years ago

1445
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,339
they were doing six billion minutes a

1446
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:27,540
day so I'm sure they're doing a crop

1447
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,299
load more than that now and that's like

1448
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,220
a drop in the bucket compared to Twitch

1449
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,780
which is the third proposal in the group

1450
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,119
that's like you know you got like 2.6

1451
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,760
million viewers live on it right now as

1452
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,079
we speak

1453
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,180
um so I think there's a fair amount of

1454
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,980
operational experience involved in that

1455
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,480
working group at some level and just

1456
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,400
wanted to pass that on thanks yeah so I

1457
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,020
don't want to put words in Glenn's mouth

1458
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,819
or anything but I think that part of the

1459
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:53,220
problem is that some of the people not

1460
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,799
necessarily represented uh in the

1461
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,780
industry there are not the ones

1462
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,460
operating the the big networks you

1463
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,380
mentioned but are the ones who are

1464
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,599
shifting data around on IP networks for

1465
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,119
other reasons and the problem the ITF

1466
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:08,460
has is they don't have their own

1467
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,559
solution and we should be very afraid if

1468
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,380
they rule their own so it's as much that

1469
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,140
we should have them so kill the next

1470
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,460
level of that I'm not sure I really

1471
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,220
understood just be a little more rise so

1472
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,420
so the the point I'm trying to make is

1473
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,240
not everybody who uses IP protocols is

1474
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,280
actually involved in the ietf Shocker

1475
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,760
hasn't has been true for 20 years but

1476
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,559
um part of the point that we raised when

1477
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,480
we formed mops and everything leading up

1478
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,280
to it was the fact that there is a lot

1479
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,880
of video being shipped over IP whether

1480
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,859
or not it's in the traditionally

1481
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:46,319
internet oriented companies and so what

1482
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,079
we're saying now is some of those

1483
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,480
companies are still shipping video over

1484
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,980
IP

1485
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,559
um should should make use of more ietf

1486
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,440
protocols mock might be one of might be

1487
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,299
creating one of them

1488
01:01:00,299 --> 01:01:02,040
um so it would be better if it was

1489
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,440
informed by their use cases rather than

1490
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,940
being yet another solution that works

1491
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,920
very well for those who are involved in

1492
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,839
the internet and we have more crap out

1493
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,040
there

1494
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,859
that uh sorry I have to remind myself to

1495
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:14,940
breathe

1496
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,400
we have more crap out there um that

1497
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,619
abuses the Internet Protocol stack as we

1498
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,780
know it so in some ways it's more our

1499
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,599
interests to make sure that we can Loop

1500
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,819
more more Industries into using the

1501
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:29,579
internet well than saying anything

1502
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:31,380
against what's going on in mock maybe

1503
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,359
that's clear yeah that's fair but can

1504
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,440
you say a little more like which class

1505
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,359
of industry or class of use cases are

1506
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,319
you thinking about I'm not asking for

1507
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,579
names of companies or anything but just

1508
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:40,740
sort of like what type of all the

1509
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,059
industries that are shipping around into

1510
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,220
shipping around IP for their own editing

1511
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,400
purposes and in their own workflows

1512
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,020
across across networks that are perhaps

1513
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,540
Geographic geographically diverse right

1514
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,920
right okay so that's why I mentioned

1515
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,660
like I'd love to see somebody like BBC's

1516
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,859
I mean they're an example of that right

1517
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:57,480
for sure they clearly do it but I work

1518
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,160
with them on a regular basis and I think

1519
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,539
that the thing is is they have a class

1520
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:03,180
of solutions that are very applicable to

1521
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,160
their stuff and it's a very standardized

1522
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,960
area it's just not standardized at ITF

1523
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,539
and I'm not sure that what we're doing

1524
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:11,880
in mock it all aligns with their needs

1525
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,240
so I saw that that Glenn had his hand up

1526
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,960
again as our Tech advisor

1527
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,579
so I think I'm going to let him jump the

1528
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:21,660
closed Q

1529
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,000
for sure

1530
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,660
yeah for you pushing buttons

1531
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,579
um so you know you know Colin I think

1532
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,859
the the the vision I'm trying to put out

1533
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:33,359
here is that

1534
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,880
while there's um use cases today I think

1535
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,099
which you're right this doesn't satisfy

1536
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,980
some media use cases absolutely

1537
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,599
on the other hand media companies are

1538
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,339
really branched down to a lot of new

1539
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:45,480
areas

1540
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,920
and

1541
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,059
um even if they're not in that business

1542
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,920
today is one of their storefront items

1543
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,900
and I think that there may be useful

1544
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,420
connections that could be made here and

1545
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,280
ultimately what I'm really I'll I'll be

1546
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,900
very honest here I have two goals here I

1547
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,520
want to get them into the ITF because

1548
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,619
that means more participation and that

1549
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,960
means better standards and I also want

1550
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,420
them to get using ITF stuff more because

1551
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,099
that means less you know in-house

1552
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,140
Solutions and more standards which is

1553
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,559
good for everybody and I see this at the

1554
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,420
early stages since it is early stages I

1555
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,619
realize you've done a lot of work on it

1556
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:18,539
but it is still early stages from the

1557
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,819
itf's perspective it's a great

1558
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:23,039
opportunity to sort of wrangle them in

1559
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,539
make those connections and get them

1560
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,339
engaged and it won't all happen

1561
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:27,960
overnight and we won't get everybody in

1562
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,180
the room all at once but you know It's a

1563
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,339
Grind right and

1564
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:35,400
you know so anyways I hope we're I think

1565
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,780
we're I think we're totally agreeing let

1566
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,380
me know how I can help Okay well I think

1567
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,339
the biggest thing is bring a friend

1568
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:43,619
right so if they're people you you see

1569
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,960
that need to be in that room uh make

1570
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,980
sure that

1571
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,500
um you you encourage them make sure we

1572
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,059
know that we need to encourage them and

1573
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:52,200
we're definitely willing to do that

1574
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,558
thanks

1575
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,640
great

1576
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,039
I'm not seeing any other questions or

1577
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,780
comments in the room

1578
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,299
so thank you very much Ted for

1579
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,940
coming along and sharing that update and

1580
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,660
engaging with us

1581
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,220
all right and next up

1582
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,920
yes next up we have Chris Lemons with an

1583
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,220
update from the CTA

1584
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,220
sbacta

1585
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,780
foreign

1586
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,099
stand up here

1587
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,660
all right

1588
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,700
all right can you hear me

1589
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,559
excellent

1590
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,740
all right I'm Chris lemons I am here on

1591
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,680
behalf at the moment of the CTA wave

1592
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,460
project and specifically the uh cmsd cat

1593
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,700
and smt working groups I just wanted to

1594
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,000
give you a general idea of some of the

1595
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,920
drafts that are coming out of that group

1596
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,720
and maybe get some cross-pollination

1597
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,618
next slide

1598
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,400
okay so first off all of these groups

1599
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,859
are all of these uh drafts are the work

1600
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:20,220
combined effort of the SVA and the CTA

1601
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,559
so the software video Alliance and the

1602
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,380
consumer technology Association

1603
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,520
specifically the web application video

1604
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,579
ecosystem group are working together to

1605
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,200
produce these standards

1606
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,480
talk about the common media server data

1607
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,819
common access token streaming media

1608
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:38,280
tracing and I'm just going to go very

1609
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,720
high level on these next slide

1610
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,240
so the common media server data is the

1611
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,339
other half of the common media client

1612
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:51,240
data which is published as CTA 5004 this

1613
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,420
draft is nearing completion and its job

1614
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,220
is to carry data from the origin down

1615
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,440
towards the clients whereas the cmcd

1616
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,539
specification carries data from the

1617
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,160
clients upwards

1618
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,180
the goal here is to carry data that cdns

1619
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,720
can use operationally

1620
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,640
um to make decisions about how they are

1621
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,619
going to handle the data more

1622
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,119
intelligently

1623
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,299
split into two headers the cmsd static

1624
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:19,980
header which is data about the media

1625
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,260
object itself and the dynamic header

1626
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,880
which is data about the connection that

1627
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,619
is transferring the object next slide

1628
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,640
I am not going to go into all of the

1629
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,200
keys but I did put them up on the screen

1630
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,339
for you

1631
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:34,740
these are the attributes of the object

1632
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,319
and the origins response

1633
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,099
next slide

1634
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,960
same story these are the key attributes

1635
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,680
that are about the specific response and

1636
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,480
all of these are added together like

1637
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,700
proxy status and cache status into an

1638
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,319
agglutinative header

1639
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,220
next slide

1640
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,020
all right moving on to the common access

1641
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:02,039
token this is uh this is very similar to

1642
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:04,799
the URI signing token work out of the

1643
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,839
cdni working group

1644
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,700
this token is focusing on the streaming

1645
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,119
media uses very similar to what some of

1646
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:16,079
the work in the cvni group was doing

1647
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,760
the goal here though is to have one

1648
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,559
token that covers all of the existing

1649
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,760
industry use cases adoption is key

1650
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,819
uh we have a lot of energy in the room

1651
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:29,220
um a lot of different players and I am

1652
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,559
hoping I'm actually very optimistic for

1653
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:34,020
implementation of this uh fairly uh

1654
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,038
widely next slide

1655
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,299
okay

1656
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,859
um again not going to go through all of

1657
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:42,780
these but these are the claims that it

1658
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,760
has we start off with the core claims

1659
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,539
that you would expect in any cwt yes the

1660
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:52,799
uh token is based on cwt format and it

1661
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,559
goes usually in the URI

1662
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:58,020
um and then we have a bunch of General

1663
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:02,160
claims that are uh details about exactly

1664
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,819
what uh uh what kinds of attributes of

1665
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:08,760
the request the token is valid for

1666
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,680
so that you can limit it to specific

1667
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,920
sorts of Uris specific methods say that

1668
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,780
this token can be used for a get but not

1669
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,699
a push and so on next slide

1670
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,279
composition claims this is somewhat new

1671
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,238
to cwts in general

1672
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:32,339
um was created for the uh cat and we

1673
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:35,460
have two kinds there the and or and nor

1674
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,560
Boolean logic claims do exactly what you

1675
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,439
expect what they say on the 10.

1676
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:42,420
um and they will have lists of claims

1677
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,819
inside them and so that you can do the

1678
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:46,859
logic on that uh we also have an

1679
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:49,319
encrypted claim because sometimes you

1680
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,698
don't want

1681
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:52,259
um certain kinds of information being

1682
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:55,859
stored easily readable in the URI and

1683
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:58,979
other information uh needs to be secret

1684
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:00,839
from the

1685
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:04,799
um uh from the holder of the URI so we

1686
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,658
have an encrypted claim as well

1687
01:09:06,658 --> 01:09:09,979
the critical claim there is there to

1688
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,658
facilitate the encrypted claim

1689
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:15,140
since we have composite claims

1690
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,500
or composition claims we have to have uh

1691
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,779
implementation limits right now we've

1692
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:23,520
got that set about four levels of

1693
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,460
nesting and 50 list elements

1694
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,439
um but we have some more maximums that

1695
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,658
are well technically these are defined

1696
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:33,600
as uh implementation minimums you have

1697
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,520
to support at least this much but we

1698
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,319
know operationally that means maximum

1699
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,020
next slide

1700
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,540
action claims these are interesting in

1701
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,000
that these are claims that do not limit

1702
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,979
the utility of the token but they affect

1703
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:51,719
the response uh response of the verifier

1704
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:53,880
the renewal claim is very similar to the

1705
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,040
renewal that you'd see in the CD and I

1706
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,800
uh working group token

1707
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,860
um and it can be renewed as either a

1708
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,800
cookie or a header and this allows you

1709
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,440
to specify uh the parameters on the

1710
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,840
cookie in case you want to have your

1711
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,340
cookie be something like same-site

1712
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,620
strict which is great

1713
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,960
um the if control response is still

1714
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,300
being worked on but the idea is that we

1715
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,760
want the issuer of the token to be able

1716
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,960
to

1717
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,560
set a location or a particular content

1718
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,140
code a status code to be returned when

1719
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,600
the token doesn't verify so it puts them

1720
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,880
in the driver's seat next slide

1721
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,739
moving right along we have the stream

1722
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:37,260
media tracing group this is a very new

1723
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,300
group of which I am one of the uh

1724
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,980
co-chairs we don't have any

1725
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,980
specification language set but we have

1726
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,719
finally settled on three major scopes

1727
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:48,540
for this work we have the uh Push Pull

1728
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,540
and Export model uh where the push is

1729
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,140
covering tracing all the way from uh for

1730
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,699
specifically streaming media all the way

1731
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:59,880
from the camera lens to the origin and

1732
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,679
keeping track of the entities that

1733
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,840
process it along the way and the latency

1734
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,420
is introduced and that sort of thing

1735
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,960
export is about taking it um off of the

1736
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,760
uh line from the uh from the camera to

1737
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,000
the viewer and sending the logs or

1738
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,239
traces to a third entity and we are

1739
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:24,120
looking heavily at the open Telemetry

1740
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,560
specification for that because it does

1741
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,620
that very well and so we want to use

1742
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,560
existing standards wherever possible uh

1743
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,060
for the poll

1744
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,440
um process

1745
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,340
that is in tracing in band for HTTP

1746
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,840
requests and responses and we're

1747
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,699
actually expecting that even though

1748
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:43,800
streaming media is our primary use case

1749
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,540
this may be something that is also

1750
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,179
fairly generalizable because HTTP is

1751
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,040
just http

1752
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,780
the goal here though is to collect and

1753
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,360
Report observational data even if it's

1754
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,940
not immediately actionable

1755
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,780
next slide

1756
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,300
a number of these use agglutinative

1757
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,900
headers so these are headers like via

1758
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,620
cache status proxy status and the idea

1759
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:15,600
is that each entity that processes

1760
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,440
um one of these requests will add their

1761
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,600
the their name whatever they decide

1762
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,600
their name is along with the parameters

1763
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,040
that are appropriate to that particular

1764
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,060
header

1765
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,159
uh this is how these existing headers

1766
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,440
work

1767
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,239
um uh we are trying to encourage uh

1768
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,860
because we're getting a fairly

1769
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,140
reasonable number of ignitive headers

1770
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,880
one of the things we're looking at is

1771
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,440
we're trying to encourage entities to

1772
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,199
make sure they use the same name for

1773
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:49,920
themselves whatever they are uh when

1774
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,719
they put values in more than one of

1775
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:53,699
these headers at a time that'll help

1776
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:56,219
when the data gets exported or needs to

1777
01:12:56,219 --> 01:12:58,260
be cross-compared for whatever reasons

1778
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,800
next slide

1779
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,900
I think I may have a few minutes left

1780
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,379
for questions

1781
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,360
indeed you do

1782
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,139
any questions

1783
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,800
you want to uh voice what you said at

1784
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,159
the mic possibly

1785
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,840
yeah

1786
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,679
sure for the common access tokens

1787
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:30,179
um hopefully you're not allowing those

1788
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:32,520
to be locked to IP addresses there's one

1789
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,080
thing that for those sorts of access

1790
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,880
tokens lots of them to IP addresses

1791
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,080
causes no

1792
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,500
end of operational pain

1793
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,260
you're right and there is a lot of text

1794
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,260
in there saying that IP addresses are uh

1795
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,679
almost useless for identifying uh people

1796
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,159
or systems and you should never use them

1797
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:56,640
and yet the goal is adoption and it is

1798
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,159
effectively an industry requirement

1799
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:02,760
so the compromise is effectively the

1800
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,560
same compromise that the cdni working

1801
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,540
group

1802
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,100
took when they did the exact set when

1803
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,840
they had were faced with the exact same

1804
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,940
problem

1805
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,780
um any IP addresses that are

1806
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:20,460
um more specific than 24 24 56 as

1807
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,400
appropriate must be in the encrypted

1808
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,540
claims

1809
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,980
the encrypted claims are a lot more

1810
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,980
difficult to use and I'm frankly kind of

1811
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,420
hoping that no one ever needs to use

1812
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:34,620
them but they do exist there and uh

1813
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,500
there is a use case for them as little

1814
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,659
as I I like that

1815
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:42,120
it's not just a specificity issue it's

1816
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,219
also one of the biggest blockers to

1817
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:47,219
getting media content on IPv6 we've seen

1818
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:48,840
so it becomes a really big operational

1819
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,239
headache because you have a broken to

1820
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,520
get set on before and then try to be

1821
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,320
redeemed on V6

1822
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,640
um similar things happen with things

1823
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,820
like um privacy proxies so

1824
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,940
the it may be worth looking at

1825
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,159
this might be even something for mops to

1826
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,739
look at is is there some way to be much

1827
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:10,560
more clear to to Industry saying no stop

1828
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,480
doing this this is this is this is a

1829
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,640
problem because I've also seen that case

1830
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,860
where some industry groups will try to

1831
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:20,280
say say well we'll say oh well our

1832
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,440
standard is you need to lock tokens to

1833
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,140
IP addresses and

1834
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,120
um I think having a some standards

1835
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,100
groups come out and say no don't do that

1836
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,100
you could also Point people at

1837
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,719
um might might be better than just

1838
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:35,100
putting them in blog post telling them

1839
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,659
not to do it

1840
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:40,380
yeah yeah and I agree the goal with this

1841
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,600
particular token is not to uh enforce

1842
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,880
anyone's particular business model even

1843
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,800
if that business model has very

1844
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,679
significant operational problems

1845
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:50,460
um

1846
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,219
we we've tried probably three or four

1847
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:56,040
times to remove the ability to lock

1848
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,080
tokens to IP addresses from the drafts

1849
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,420
and there are just too many people who

1850
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,380
have said we won't implement this or we

1851
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,260
will Implement some variation of this uh

1852
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,140
uh regardless of what the specification

1853
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,219
says uh the uh CTA is very much like the

1854
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:16,500
ietf in that we don't have a police

1855
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,000
force

1856
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,560
so is

1857
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,100
I mean not not having looked at what the

1858
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,320
industry what what what the industry is

1859
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,380
doing in this area uh very closely uh

1860
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,699
has there been an attempt to uh to

1861
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:33,540
um

1862
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,780
sort of uh reveal and document the

1863
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:40,380
reasons why industry players want to use

1864
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,440
IP addresses in their claims and what

1865
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,140
better Alternatives there are uh for

1866
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,600
achieving the same goals yeah so there's

1867
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,060
a couple of really simple uh use cases

1868
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,360
that IP addresses just make really easy

1869
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,520
and a very standard and a very standard

1870
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,500
one that keeps coming up again and again

1871
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,760
is

1872
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,159
I just want to let anyone in who comes

1873
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,440
in on a 10 dot address right

1874
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,739
I trust those addresses I I don't care

1875
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:09,480
and so

1876
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,159
um

1877
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,440
I get it that's how their things are set

1878
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,300
up and while I don't think that that's

1879
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,280
necessarily the most robust way to do

1880
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,719
things

1881
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,280
um that is how they have it set up

1882
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,179
operationally and they have a need for

1883
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:27,739
that sort of capability

1884
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,000
and yes there are multiple paragraphs of

1885
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,140
text saying why this is a bad idea

1886
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,140
yeah I was more suggesting the okay this

1887
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,659
is a bad idea and here are some

1888
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,100
Alternatives I think it's the second

1889
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,159
part that may be uh that I I don't know

1890
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,940
what the status of of that is uh not not

1891
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,340
just in your draft but also in

1892
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,140
um sort of

1893
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,440
documentation of the industry has

1894
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,780
overall in this area I just don't know

1895
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,040
if it's if it's something that's that

1896
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,080
people have spent a lot of time on given

1897
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,820
that hey we've got IP addresses we could

1898
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,280
just use those in our claims well I mean

1899
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,460
as operationally as was pointed out you

1900
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,840
mostly can't

1901
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,360
um uh dual stack devices devices

1902
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,360
changing their IP addresses devices that

1903
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,420
have IPv6 addresses

1904
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,120
um all of that is a significant

1905
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,000
operational concern uh entities that

1906
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,179
deploy this and expect IP address to

1907
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:32,460
work on the bare internet are going to

1908
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,540
disappoint their customers

1909
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,400
great

1910
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,320
not seeing any other questions or

1911
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,300
comments thank you very much Chris

1912
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,980
and if you want more information about

1913
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,820
the cdni or about the uh common access

1914
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,040
token there will be a slightly more

1915
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,440
in-depth presentation in the city of the

1916
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,099
United working group

1917
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,199
great thank you all right so next up we

1918
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:01,400
have Luis Contreras

1919
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,239
telling us about real world stuff

1920
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,360
so hello everyone I would like to share

1921
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,159
with all of you one initiative that we

1922
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,620
are running in in telefonica with the

1923
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:28,380
objective of trying to to to make the

1924
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:31,020
delivery of content a network aware so

1925
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,820
we are doing an exercise of integrating

1926
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,420
Alto uh is such a way that way with

1927
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,340
throughout or we can expose all these

1928
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,780
simple information that could fit the

1929
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,500
CDN logic and with that improve the the

1930
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,659
performance we I represent on behalf of

1931
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,460
my colleagues Patricia nice and

1932
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:50,699
Francisco as you can see this is a joint

1933
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:52,560
work between the transporter group and

1934
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,440
the video group and yeah I will provide

1935
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,659
the details so next slide please thank

1936
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,460
you so a little bit about about

1937
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,620
background of telefonica because it is

1938
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,679
important thinking on the next steps we

1939
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:07,080
are telefonica is a group of different

1940
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,260
companies different operational business

1941
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,239
present in 15 countries mostly Latin

1942
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,620
America and Europe

1943
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16,980
plus a tire one international carrier so

1944
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,080
we provide multiple Services as you can

1945
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,179
imagine residential mobile and so but

1946
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:23,100
also we have a

1947
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,320
contents that we distribute we we have

1948
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,139
contents produced by ourselves and with

1949
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:30,480
one several several brands

1950
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,520
like movie Star Plus and moisture play

1951
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,820
but also we deliver third party contents

1952
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,460
right we do we do this through an

1953
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:42,000
in-house CDN that has been developed by

1954
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,800
by the video group

1955
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,960
and this is called what I will refer to

1956
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,600
that as telephonic acidian or tcdn and

1957
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,699
this tcdn is worldwide deployed we have

1958
01:20:50,699 --> 01:20:53,159
a you can see there the the list of

1959
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:54,780
countries where we have a different

1960
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,880
streamers everybody points we have in

1961
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,760
Spain Brazil Argentina Chile Colombia

1962
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,000
Peru Ecuador Mexico and the USA and

1963
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,880
we'll start we are starting to deploy as

1964
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,739
well in Germany so trying to cover all

1965
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:09,659
the footprint of telefonica in in order

1966
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:11,699
to deliver all these content

1967
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:14,580
uh the mechanisms for delivering is is

1968
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,639
based on HTTP adaptive streaming and

1969
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,800
this is uh used for serving either

1970
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,080
internal or external customers so so how

1971
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,760
we are delivering the content over the

1972
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,440
top so external customers to telefonica

1973
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,380
can receive as well the the this content

1974
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,760
so

1975
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,100
think you know talking a little bit

1976
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,260
about the the CDN the logic that the CDN

1977
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,840
is using for the deciding what is the

1978
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,380
streamer more convenient for a given a

1979
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,600
customer so essentially the the request

1980
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,880
protein logic that is is being used take

1981
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,060
into account the number of inputs uh the

1982
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,400
streamer health status the load level

1983
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,560
the availability of the content the cash

1984
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,139
hit radio maximization and so on so far

1985
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:57,300
but also and importantly and this is the

1986
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,340
topic of Interest let's say for for this

1987
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,960
presentation it's also the network

1988
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,900
topology by now this network topology is

1989
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,560
fed into the CD analogy manually so

1990
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,020
somehow there is a group of people with

1991
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,480
taking into consideration what are the

1992
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,800
different prefixes of the different

1993
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,440
customers are located in the in existing

1994
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,420
points of presence of the telephonica

1995
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:21,840
networks and this is fed as I told you

1996
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,860
manually and and and so how this is the

1997
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,600
the the the kind of problem that we

1998
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,340
would like to to solve now this is the

1999
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,560
initial Revenue foreign

2000
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,719
for this activity in fact so how we

2001
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:35,760
could go in an automatic manner of

2002
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,699
maintaining these Maps uh yeah being

2003
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:41,760
being I mean provided in an automatic

2004
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,360
way the reason of going in in in this

2005
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,219
direction is because the different

2006
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:49,440
prefixes of the network can be can be

2007
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,880
changed because there are consideration

2008
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,860
of accesses of migrating for instance

2009
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,860
for DSL access to Fiverr and so so this

2010
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:00,360
implies that sometimes the the uh the

2011
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,460
addresses of the IP addresses are reused

2012
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,840
between different points of presence

2013
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,639
also there could be events in the

2014
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:08,699
network that could motivate the previous

2015
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,920
election based on this manual feeding

2016
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,900
could not be the optimal and so on so

2017
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,000
far so this is this was essentially the

2018
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,800
the driver and the motivation for this

2019
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,659
work so next slide please

2020
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:23,340
so the rationale of of making the tcdn

2021
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,380
transport Network aware is again to

2022
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,000
optimize the delivery so at the end what

2023
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,760
we will do is we want to do is is to

2024
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,860
have a more efficient way of uh of

2025
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,360
delivering the traffic to the customer

2026
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,239
where where this customer is

2027
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,239
so with this aesthetic view with this

2028
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:42,120
manual feeding of the topologies we we

2029
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,560
have these situations that cannot be

2030
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,020
controlled Network outages Network

2031
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,360
congestion the migration of the prefixes

2032
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,699
and so on so this requires a periodic

2033
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:53,159
and a

2034
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:56,880
a grade of the of these Network maps and

2035
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,760
well the what we push you essentially is

2036
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,080
to have this

2037
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,120
um with a timely information in an

2038
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,800
automatic way and this is why we

2039
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,500
leverage in Alto for doing that

2040
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,520
next slide please

2041
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,540
so how can the world looks like that

2042
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,520
because it's important to understand

2043
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,520
what is let's say the playground uh for

2044
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,600
for all all all these uh work you know

2045
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,360
yeah the network on telefonica well you

2046
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,760
saw before we have so many networks in

2047
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,300
very in so many countries so there is

2048
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,860
not a common pattern but somehow this

2049
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,480
would reflect a converter that we are

2050
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,639
following at the time of Designing the

2051
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:38,100
telephonical networks so we divide in a

2052
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,679
number of hierarchical levels but you

2053
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:43,679
can see there is a kind of topology or a

2054
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,420
canonical topology that we could have in

2055
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,719
a mid-sized country so we have the

2056
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:50,159
hierarchical level one that represent

2057
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,420
the interconditional level for

2058
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,159
interconnecting to other Transit

2059
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:56,219
providers or either the tire one from

2060
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,340
telefonica but also uh other

2061
01:24:59,340 --> 01:24:59,960
um

2062
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,980
uh Transit providers or ottps or whoever

2063
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,139
then we have the hierarchical ml2 that

2064
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:09,480
would be a mesh part of the network that

2065
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,739
takes essentially the traffic coming

2066
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,540
from the from the boundaries from the

2067
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,800
perineum from the transit and then

2068
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,900
distributed to the different regions and

2069
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,639
then we'll start in the topology that is

2070
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:19,739
covering the different regions that

2071
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,360
would be the the hierarchical level

2072
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,820
three which essentially is a kind of um

2073
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:27,659
a dual headings in in some regions or so

2074
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:29,880
depending on the size of the region for

2075
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,219
sure it could be more more than two and

2076
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:33,360
then we have the local level the

2077
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,460
hierarchical level four which are rep

2078
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,500
which represents basically the central

2079
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,500
offices and then hierarchical level 5 or

2080
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,900
even six that is essentially could

2081
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,880
represent the the more remote areas or

2082
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,440
the cell side routers and so connecting

2083
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,360
the the different customers so the

2084
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,920
customers are essentially

2085
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,580
as today connected in local level in the

2086
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,199
hierarchical level for hierarchical

2087
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,719
level five or could it be even connected

2088
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,880
in hierarchical level six as you can

2089
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,980
imagine not all the countries have the

2090
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,960
same the same structure it's not the

2091
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,120
same as Spain as Brazil or Germany as

2092
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,520
Argentina or Chile are very different

2093
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,380
geographies and and this implies

2094
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,639
different different kind of

2095
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:14,520
architectures just for put in an example

2096
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,280
if you put Brazil on top of the map of

2097
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,080
Europe we will be covered in an area

2098
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,800
like from Lisbon to Moscow so it's it's

2099
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,260
different sizes that can modify somehow

2100
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,020
these canonical architecture

2101
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:31,260
let's move to the next slide yes just to

2102
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,360
present what could be I mean we saw

2103
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,219
before what would be a canonical

2104
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:36,900
architecture this is an excerpt

2105
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,679
representing uh Sonic's 16 deployment in

2106
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:44,040
in in in the operation in Spain and here

2107
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,080
we just represent some few notes for a

2108
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,960
hierarchical level one two one three

2109
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,820
um hierarchical level one will be

2110
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,100
represented by the Cycles Layer Two by

2111
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,719
the squares and larger three by the

2112
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,760
triangles so these represent the the

2113
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,400
upper part so from this part

2114
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,440
um below we have had the the central

2115
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,900
offices we have the the SSI routers and

2116
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,239
the remote areas and so on so far so the

2117
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,699
idea is we we have so many streamers

2118
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:11,159
deployed in the in the network so how do

2119
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,219
we can improve how we can maintain the

2120
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:16,620
the optimal delivery of the video as

2121
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,719
long as we suffer these changes in in

2122
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,760
the network again changes in the in the

2123
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,620
movement of the prefixes in the across

2124
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,900
the different Central offices changes in

2125
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,400
the in the network itself because there

2126
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,980
could be link outages or no outages or

2127
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:32,040
so so trying to find a mechanism to

2128
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,100
optimize this delivery in real time

2129
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,460
let's say so next slide please

2130
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,000
so how tcdn could leverage on the alto

2131
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,440
information in the information I suppose

2132
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,040
by Alto Accord in relation with the

2133
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,440
topology and so so essentially the the

2134
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,199
objective here would be to always to

2135
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,860
create a network map where we can

2136
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:58,620
somehow associate different prefixes to

2137
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:02,340
different identifiers that is are called

2138
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,920
pids with us on how we can group the

2139
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,840
prefixes of the customers in the central

2140
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,620
offices the ranges the slash 24

2141
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:13,199
20 or whatever

2142
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,100
um

2143
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,100
we've done I mean we create apids for

2144
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,600
for customers identifying the the

2145
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,280
prefixes of the customers and then also

2146
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,980
we generate pids Associated to the

2147
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,080
streamers in such a way that uh through

2148
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,860
this uh through these Maps we can have a

2149
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,880
a timely view of what will be the cost

2150
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,260
and the reachability between the

2151
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,820
different pids in the network so

2152
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,739
essentially how the streamers can be

2153
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:40,020
rich or how the streamers can reach the

2154
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,739
different customers and identifying the

2155
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,020
the cost Associated to that we will

2156
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,880
detail a little bit later but this

2157
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,460
course is easily now we are playing with

2158
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,800
a number of hops that could be some more

2159
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,380
richer information in some point on time

2160
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:56,820
so we are working also in attack

2161
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,820
election so what we do uh with with

2162
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:03,120
these Maps is to determine what will be

2163
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,219
in every time the more convenient

2164
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:06,659
streamer to deliver the content

2165
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:08,400
according to the request that is coming

2166
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,739
from the from the customer you can see

2167
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:12,659
there are a very simple example that we

2168
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:13,980
use in the lab in the in the premier

2169
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:17,520
steps in this work and and you can see

2170
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,340
reflected the the idea the basic idea so

2171
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,400
the pages of the streamers can correlate

2172
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,440
it with the pids of the of the customers

2173
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,060
and with that perform the the best

2174
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:27,960
selection

2175
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,659
let's move to the next slide please so

2176
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:32,280
we represent the network map and the

2177
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,560
cost map so in the network map as I told

2178
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,780
you before it's essentially the

2179
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,340
um the grouping of the different

2180
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,739
prefixes to the pids

2181
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:42,480
um and here this is related to the

2182
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,520
sample before so you can check later on

2183
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,360
offline

2184
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,060
and then we have the cost map that shows

2185
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,440
the reachability between the different

2186
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,260
pids so in a very straightforward manner

2187
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,360
we can select we can filter and we can

2188
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,580
select what could be the most convenient

2189
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,400
streamer for the A specific group of

2190
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,320
prefixes in the network

2191
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,260
the network the network map is generated

2192
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,199
through establishing bdp session between

2193
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:10,139
Alto and and some root reflector in the

2194
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:12,960
network so with bgp we export we can

2195
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,360
advertise the preferences Associated to

2196
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,280
the to the end users in the central

2197
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,580
offices as they are being configured at

2198
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:21,900
the end the the preferences are

2199
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,000
associated to the BNG which is a element

2200
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,620
uh

2201
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:30,659
yeah and in the PPP session so the BEP

2202
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,760
is in this Central offices and the PDP

2203
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,560
is integrated with uh with the router

2204
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,840
that can the possibility of advertising

2205
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,420
these preferences so this is in one hand

2206
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,159
the the advertisement of the preferences

2207
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:43,020
Associated to the customers and to the

2208
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,360
streamers and then in the other hand we

2209
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,580
have that the topology itself for that

2210
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,440
we use bepls

2211
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,840
and with bgpls we can have the view of

2212
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,159
the nodes and the links connect the

2213
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:54,540
interconnecting the different nodes in

2214
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,000
the network inside so the final result

2215
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,820
is that we can build this cost map with

2216
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,280
essentially is the represents let's say

2217
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,679
the reachability between streamers and

2218
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,420
and users

2219
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,820
next slide please

2220
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:11,159
so the process for that we follow in in

2221
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:12,600
this integration

2222
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,239
was first to start a

2223
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:18,179
um the the feasibility phase in the lab

2224
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:21,000
so we played the with a very simplistic

2225
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,860
or a couple of very simplistic scenarios

2226
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,360
these are documented in the backup

2227
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,239
slides so you can take a look later on

2228
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,940
so uh we are starting essentially to

2229
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,620
understand the the visibility of the

2230
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,780
this mechanism for having an up-to-date

2231
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,120
view of the network so introducing

2232
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,460
outages into introducing new prefaces

2233
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:40,440
and so such a way that we verify that

2234
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:44,699
the visibility of of this exercise then

2235
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,920
we move to a pre-production lab I will

2236
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,480
provide more details later in the next

2237
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,659
slide but we move a production lab where

2238
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:53,159
we started to

2239
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:55,440
to play with real configurations in the

2240
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,480
network real situations that we could

2241
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,639
find in the network but in a more

2242
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,380
control environment so reduced number of

2243
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,320
devices but the complexities of the

2244
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,679
configuration that we would face once we

2245
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,020
move to production and we are now in the

2246
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,139
point of moving into production we we

2247
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:15,300
are working on the deployment of Alto in

2248
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,739
in the real Network we will start with

2249
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,620
telephonic Spain a PDF moving later on

2250
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,020
to other companies in the in the group

2251
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,780
and here the point now that we are doing

2252
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:27,600
is trying to introduce Alto in the

2253
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,120
specific rules and processes and

2254
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,280
procedures and so that a production

2255
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,400
level implies in terms of secure

2256
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,620
securitization uh hardening all the

2257
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,719
stuff

2258
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,880
playing with the different IP addresses

2259
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,320
for connectivity within the different

2260
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,880
elements and so on so forth I will

2261
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,580
provide now more details on all these

2262
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:50,520
engineering steps so next slide please

2263
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,340
thank you so these are these as I

2264
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,219
provide a little bit of details about

2265
01:32:55,219 --> 01:32:57,659
where the the

2266
01:32:57,659 --> 01:32:59,520
engineering impact that we follow and

2267
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,800
what we what issues we faced in this

2268
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,440
process in the technology lab test as I

2269
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,900
said we started with a auto module that

2270
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,199
is present in open daylight uh this

2271
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:12,000
um this module was working in Italy with

2272
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,699
lldp so our first task that we do was to

2273
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:17,340
integrate with the bgp module of open

2274
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,540
daylight

2275
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,940
uh in this technology lab test we

2276
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,100
started playing with a monovender router

2277
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,199
scenario these routers were built for

2278
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,880
life so we were playing its own servers

2279
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,840
and so

2280
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,760
generating the issues as I mentioned

2281
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,679
before the outages of the nodes outages

2282
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,960
of the links creating new prefixes and

2283
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,600
so on so far we play with a very

2284
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,020
simplistic network with just one single

2285
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:42,360
igp on on top of that or SPF in that

2286
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,880
case a single autonomous system and

2287
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,280
simple metrics based on the the hop

2288
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,960
count so essentially the metric that we

2289
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,900
Associated to the AAP was just one so in

2290
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,699
such a way that we could determine the

2291
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:57,420
hop count and and that was what you also

2292
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,760
before in the course but they presented

2293
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,420
before and also in this setup the the

2294
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,980
routers themselves some of the routers

2295
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,120
themselves were acting as Road

2296
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,639
reflectors so very simplistic setup in

2297
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,199
this case with Alto as well being

2298
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:11,639
beautiful eyes in that server that I

2299
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:13,920
mentioned before from this we move to

2300
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,500
the production Network test now the

2301
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,500
things started to change we migrated to

2302
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,280
xav as a open source bgp speaker for

2303
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,440
interacting with a real Rock reflectors

2304
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,960
in this preparation environment we in

2305
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,719
this exercise of migrating to xav we've

2306
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,900
found some issues for bdpls We rise a

2307
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,639
number of tickets you have data details

2308
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:37,440
you want to check these issues were

2309
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,020
basically related to bgpls at the time

2310
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:42,540
of parsing the information of bepls in

2311
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:44,699
order to build the to be able to build

2312
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:47,219
the the cost map okay the relationship

2313
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:49,619
between the pids that I mentioned before

2314
01:34:49,619 --> 01:34:51,360
display production Network environment

2315
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,659
is a multi-mender

2316
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:56,820
multivender router scenario and the

2317
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,800
router vendors that are present in this

2318
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,840
in both pre-production and production

2319
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,400
Network are different to the ones from

2320
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,820
the lab test so essentially we we have

2321
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,500
tested at the end three different

2322
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:10,080
vendors on this setup

2323
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,760
um and this multivender scenarios is the

2324
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,199
real one because well the the production

2325
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,560
Network leverages or or is supported by

2326
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,679
the different vendors in reality these

2327
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,000
routers in the pre-production

2328
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,040
environment are physical routers we also

2329
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,320
deploy a dedicated Alto server there so

2330
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,179
no no longer vitalize on the same

2331
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,340
environment so it's just a dedicated

2332
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,500
server and then

2333
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,320
we have started with with this network

2334
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,139
that well generated a number of issues

2335
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:39,179
in the sense that this is a is a complex

2336
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:41,940
mpls Network so we don't have a Contin

2337
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:44,280
an IP continuity end-to-end in the

2338
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,540
different hierarchical levels that you

2339
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,179
saw at the beginning we have a hover an

2340
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:51,900
mpls continuity and this presents on

2341
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,460
issues at the time of integrating

2342
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,920
because well you need to to deal with

2343
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,600
different autonomous systems and of them

2344
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,159
in private for sure the public

2345
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:02,580
autonomous system as well and moving all

2346
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:03,840
this information with the different

2347
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,580
vendor implementations created some

2348
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,860
let's say engineering problems that we

2349
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:11,219
had to resolve in order to be able to

2350
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:14,820
expose all the topology to I mean to

2351
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,960
the

2352
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,179
to digest let's say all the topology

2353
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:20,040
information by the alto server and then

2354
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,080
to expose to the uh to the telefonica

2355
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,540
CDN

2356
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:26,340
yeah also we started playing with more

2357
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,320
sophisticated metrics so it's dedicated

2358
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,460
in the sense that we're not just

2359
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:32,100
assigning a value of one for the AGP

2360
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,719
metric but playing with the real igp

2361
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:36,119
metrics as we could found in the in the

2362
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:38,400
production Network so having Richard

2363
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,980
let's say cost Maps richer values in the

2364
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,960
course map not only the Hops but playing

2365
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,780
actually with the IEP metrics there I'm

2366
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,540
finally also another point that was

2367
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,639
different to the technology lab test was

2368
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:51,780
the connection to different Power

2369
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,880
reflectors homegrown reflectors for vgp

2370
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,679
I mean a couple of robot inflators for

2371
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,260
vgp information uh another couple of Rob

2372
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,179
reflectors for the epls this was because

2373
01:37:00,179 --> 01:37:02,639
it's somehow mimicking what we have in

2374
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,980
the a production Network and finally as

2375
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,560
I as I mentioned before we are in the in

2376
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,179
the pace of integrating all of this in

2377
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:11,460
the in the production Network so we have

2378
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,980
a in the very hard phase of the

2379
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:16,860
administrative issues for uh adapting to

2380
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,139
the production procedures the hardening

2381
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:21,480
environment as I told you before for the

2382
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,679
hardware for sure but also for the

2383
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:25,800
software because these are most all the

2384
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,139
pieces are coming from open source so we

2385
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:30,119
need to follow the internal rules of the

2386
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:32,400
engineering teams in the operational

2387
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,060
business units right also the one one

2388
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,159
situation that we have now in the in the

2389
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,900
real language is that we don't have a

2390
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,679
broad activation of bgpls on on that so

2391
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,600
we will start with some small region in

2392
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,280
the Network that has already activated

2393
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,560
the bgpls and from that we have started

2394
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,199
we will start growing this is not about

2395
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,840
I mean this is even a good thing for us

2396
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,000
in such a way that with that we we will

2397
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,400
be able to test also the scalability of

2398
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,440
all of this we have played in in I

2399
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,880
didn't mention but in the production

2400
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,100
Network we could be start playing with

2401
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,800
30 40 routers but in production Network

2402
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,500
we this will rise to several thousand

2403
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,960
routers so we need also to to have a

2404
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,000
view of how scalable will be the

2405
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,360
solution and this will be part of the in

2406
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,820
size that we will get once we move into

2407
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,100
the production Network that's the

2408
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,679
scalability at the end and yeah for sure

2409
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,239
this will coexist with so many services

2410
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:29,699
this will be also a learning process how

2411
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:31,980
to deal with that we don't expect any

2412
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,780
uh interference with that because at the

2413
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,860
end we are connecting to the raw

2414
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:37,260
reflector so we are doing nothing in in

2415
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,639
the network they are simply taking the

2416
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,560
information from the raw reflectors but

2417
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,960
okay there is always uncertainty what

2418
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,080
could be something could happen right

2419
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,520
um we expect to complete the deployment

2420
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,980
by by the end of this year and we hope

2421
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,380
to to comment in the next mobs maybe

2422
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,540
team maybe the updates on this next

2423
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:57,060
slide please

2424
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,699
so just for for finishing us next steps

2425
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,500
we will start with integration in

2426
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,020
telefonica as pay Network for later

2427
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,820
moving into the other countries of

2428
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,040
telephonica where we have the tcdn

2429
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,739
deployed the probably the next step will

2430
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:12,540
be Brazil this is something that we need

2431
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:15,420
to decide and again Brazil is a very

2432
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:16,070
uh

2433
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:18,179
[Music]

2434
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:19,920
very large challenge in the sense that

2435
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,420
there is a very big Network so and also

2436
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,840
the the topology is not so canonical as

2437
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,060
we saw before so it's it's a very good

2438
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,040
challenge that we start to face uh

2439
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,100
starting in Nigeria hopefully so

2440
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,100
apart from that we also need to complete

2441
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,199
the the full development of the tcdn

2442
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:42,659
logic so the idea is that the tcdn logic

2443
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:44,639
consumes the information that is

2444
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,679
provided by Alto so we also need to work

2445
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:50,580
on that on that line to let's say

2446
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,960
um how to say

2447
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,119
to refine the way in which we are

2448
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:56,580
interacting today with the with Alto so

2449
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,260
making more

2450
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:58,980
um

2451
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,199
iterating better in the in the CD and

2452
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,540
logic at the end so but by now it's just

2453
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,460
a kind of proof of concept in the in

2454
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,520
this sense and yeah importantly we

2455
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,380
expect to characterize Alto performance

2456
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,940
on real environment in terms of

2457
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:15,320
scalability processing we will require

2458
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:18,119
many instances of Alpha and so this is

2459
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:20,219
also something that we will see once we

2460
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:22,440
start playing with Aldo in the in the

2461
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,080
Real Environment again because we will

2462
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:26,480
handle with

2463
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,880
thousands of routers so it's a a very

2464
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,320
huge

2465
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,600
Network at the end

2466
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,600
um one another line of work so by now we

2467
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,639
are working for for the topology in

2468
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,340
order to do this and enhance uh delivery

2469
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,260
and so on trying to guarantee the

2470
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,239
quality of experience but we already do

2471
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,699
foresee the next steps in the direction

2472
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:50,340
of integrating or enriching the the

2473
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,380
course map by introducing performance

2474
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,239
metrics for instance so understanding

2475
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:55,679
what are the congestion levels maybe

2476
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,480
understanding what is the latency that

2477
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,639
we do have between the different pids so

2478
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,500
enriching the decision at the end we

2479
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,000
will start by The Hop counts because

2480
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,580
it's a or igp metrics because it's the

2481
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,760
the basic stuff but we do foresee to do

2482
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,679
um yeah more advanced metrics Etc

2483
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:12,780
whether we couldn't reach even the the

2484
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:16,380
decision in the CDN also even we are

2485
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:17,820
considering to include Access Network

2486
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:20,400
information so to have some idea what

2487
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,739
could be the technology Associated to a

2488
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:25,560
specific prefix in in the customer side

2489
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,239
so that we could have some insight about

2490
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:29,280
if the customer is accessing by Fiverr

2491
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,280
or DSL or a mobile technology or

2492
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,540
whatever

2493
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:36,360
so next that's like this this is the the

2494
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:39,119
very final one so as conclusion the the

2495
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,040
objective of all of this is to make the

2496
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,900
CDN Network aware so to have the

2497
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,639
possibility of exposing Network

2498
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,619
information to applications that could

2499
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:49,320
leverage on that Network information to

2500
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,480
perform better and tcdn is a clear case

2501
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,580
on this respect

2502
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,980
um and yeah and we also apart from this

2503
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:58,739
uh integration work that we are doing we

2504
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:00,840
are foreseeing this next step that will

2505
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,119
be to enrich the decisions incorporating

2506
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:06,000
these metrics that adds an additional

2507
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,659
complexity that we we we hope to report

2508
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:12,239
in on in some point in time and also

2509
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,159
here for for the media operational

2510
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,639
Community uh as well we would like also

2511
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:19,920
to ask for feedback from from mobs it

2512
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,360
will be very welcome to understand if

2513
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,219
this is useful if this is a good

2514
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:26,040
direction to to consider I don't know to

2515
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,080
get your your views on on this respect

2516
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,199
so you can approach directly us or even

2517
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:33,000
build them even more interestingly you

2518
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,580
could also use the auto working group

2519
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:38,460
list for for this so so how that we

2520
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,560
could discuss in a

2521
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,619
in in in in in the mailing list of

2522
01:42:43,619 --> 01:42:45,900
Ronaldo that probably would enrich also

2523
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,840
an inference of the the guys working in

2524
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,940
in Alto as well and just let me finish

2525
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:52,980
with the acknowledgments to kaigao and

2526
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:55,500
Justin San that helped us a lot at the

2527
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,540
beginning with the technology with the

2528
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:00,960
lab test and the integration with odl

2529
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,000
and so and a big thank you for them for

2530
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,040
for their help and that's all from my

2531
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,420
side thank you

2532
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,940
thank you very much

2533
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:11,219
um so Rajiv you've been very patient

2534
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:14,540
would you like to ask your question

2535
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,860
hi

2536
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:20,880
so this is actually uh going back to the

2537
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,940
slide where you were talking about

2538
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:27,138
calculating the cost Maps

2539
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,119
ah yes so um I see what you've kind of

2540
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,699
done here is uh you know you basically

2541
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:39,080
have a couple of uh

2542
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,719
pcdn notes that the PID is ending in the

2543
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,139
five and a six and a number of customers

2544
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:51,719
right uh which are a lot of varies now I

2545
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:54,500
see that you

2546
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:01,670
[Music]

2547
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:08,580
is there any specific reason why you are

2548
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:11,000
doing that

2549
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,420
the sound was very bad I could I

2550
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:16,619
couldn't get the request the video

2551
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:19,920
repeat the last part okay so um I see

2552
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,739
you you're calculating the cost not only

2553
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:26,280
of the routes from the customer endpoint

2554
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,580
to the pcdm mode you're also calculating

2555
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,800
the cost from customer to customers the

2556
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,100
customer

2557
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:37,820
umid03 for example

2558
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,980
yeah well this is essentially would be

2559
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,199
the the let's say the standard output of

2560
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,840
alpha so on top of this cost map so the

2561
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,880
idea would be to uh for us is not

2562
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,619
interesting at least with the

2563
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:50,940
integration with the CDN it's not

2564
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:52,500
interesting to

2565
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,760
to have the reachability between

2566
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,860
customers so this would be filtered so

2567
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:58,920
the The Next Step will be on top of this

2568
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:02,159
course map to filter and only uh retain

2569
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:04,440
the reachability between the um

2570
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,560
streamers and the different users so by

2571
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,780
now we will not use the user to user

2572
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:14,519
information so routing

2573
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:18,780
[Music]

2574
01:45:22,139 --> 01:45:25,199
I couldn't get you again okay so I was

2575
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:27,119
just saying this cost map would go

2576
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,739
through another layer of filtering

2577
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:31,080
before you use it as input for your

2578
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,780
routing work yeah and my second question

2579
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,860
here

2580
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:36,840
is uh

2581
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,659
in the slide exactly previous to this

2582
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,460
can you move back one slide where you're

2583
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:44,040
allotting the CID

2584
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:48,000
um I'm assuming you are looking at pids

2585
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,420
not at the level of individual users but

2586
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:54,239
at the level of individual uh user

2587
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,119
segments so each slash 21st rather than

2588
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:00,060
each user

2589
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,159
uh I I I'm just gonna let that

2590
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,380
assumption is today

2591
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,060
but I'm not sure if I understood the

2592
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,920
question you mean that we are looking at

2593
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,560
PID level not at the specific prefix of

2594
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,840
the customer is that yeah no I mean are

2595
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,159
you allotting the pids for each prefix

2596
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,638
for each customer

2597
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,900
sorry I couldn't understand

2598
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:27,480
your audio is really yeah is this is

2599
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,159
this better

2600
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:32,699
no not at all okay uh I will be back in

2601
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:34,679
a moment hopefully with better audio

2602
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:37,679
okay thank you I'm sorry

2603
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,960
so we can we can take uh Eric's question

2604
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,420
now so hey thanks Cisco without any yet

2605
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,820
except interested about what you are

2606
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,320
doing so thank you for the presentation

2607
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,860
the tradition as well that mobs is very

2608
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:52,260
different kind of point of view go to

2609
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,860
questions how often are those Maps

2610
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:58,380
recomputed or often can a change be done

2611
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,580
well by now this is a

2612
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,560
hello

2613
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,840
well I think Ronaldo's way of retrieving

2614
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,540
the map so deep I mean

2615
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,119
the CDM will ask no I mean we have not

2616
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,460
specified a frequency for these updates

2617
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:19,380
so budobe I mean this is not yet uh

2618
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:21,179
considered at all but we don't expect a

2619
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:22,980
continuous update of the of the of the

2620
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,920
statement so take into account how we

2621
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,920
are uh now with the manual procedure we

2622
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,840
also have a date in the maps every six

2623
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:33,960
months no no so what even if we go to a

2624
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,699
daily retrieval of the information would

2625
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:39,420
be a great advance so but we don't have

2626
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,119
that we have not thought yet how will be

2627
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:45,179
the the the frequency of a dating but

2628
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:47,580
you can do weekly or daily something

2629
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,320
like that okay because my next question

2630
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,320
will have been oh disruptivity because

2631
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,060
if you were doing it every minute could

2632
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,500
disrupt the capital of streams right

2633
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,360
yeah but if you do it daily I mean I

2634
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,920
guess you don't care so much something

2635
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,840
like that maybe weekly I mean they can

2636
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:03,179
talk about I mean probably the the more

2637
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:05,699
uh frequent changes that or the changes

2638
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:08,100
that could be more representative for a

2639
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,840
real-time feedback could be Network

2640
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,480
outages or so this would be impact in

2641
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,800
some part of the network maybe not on

2642
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,440
that but even in that case you you could

2643
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:19,320
retrieve an update even in case of

2644
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,780
someone outage so but could be would be

2645
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,820
discrete events along the times or not

2646
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:26,699
every minute not every hours so

2647
01:48:26,699 --> 01:48:30,060
okay thank you and the last one I guess

2648
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,100
it assumes that the network is the same

2649
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,320
MTU everywhere right

2650
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,739
oh yes okay

2651
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:40,199
thank you

2652
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:42,900
thanks uh Rajiv would you like to try

2653
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,080
again

2654
01:48:45,179 --> 01:48:48,060
yes I hope this audio is better

2655
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:52,199
yes much thankfully okay so my second

2656
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,719
question was basically with regards to

2657
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:57,659
allotting the pids for

2658
01:48:57,659 --> 01:48:59,699
um the end users so are you actually

2659
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:03,360
looking at pids for every end user or is

2660
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,480
it more like one PID per unique end user

2661
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,340
prefix

2662
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:11,340
oh okay now I got it no these pages will

2663
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,080
be a percentile office so essentially

2664
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,000
you will associate to the to the

2665
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,320
preferences that you have declared in

2666
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,420
the BNG that is in a central office so

2667
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,780
you you group a bunch of preferences in

2668
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:24,380
the same PIV

2669
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:32,059
OT yeah

2670
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,840
the first question is uh uh there are um

2671
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,659
you know similar efforts in place right

2672
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:40,619
now

2673
01:49:40,619 --> 01:49:43,139
um you know though they are more tied to

2674
01:49:43,139 --> 01:49:44,760
specific Cloud vendors and stuff like

2675
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,760
that to make this kind of internal Telco

2676
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,639
Network topology consumable as a service

2677
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,820
for people who are looking at uh doing

2678
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,520
some sort of Service delivery uh using

2679
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,580
uh you know beep Edge nodes in 5G and

2680
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:02,340
Mech environments so do you have plans

2681
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:05,520
to um eventually make this uh or at

2682
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,800
least the subset of this information

2683
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,480
available outside of your integration

2684
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,599
with tcdn and uh you know make it

2685
01:50:12,599 --> 01:50:14,880
consumable by other uh you know

2686
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,860
potential people who are hosting on the

2687
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,000
make

2688
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,119
yes as we do foresee Alto

2689
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:24,659
in general is to to play the role of as

2690
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:26,520
a network special function for whoever

2691
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,560
customer could be internal customer or

2692
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,659
external customer and with these Special

2693
01:50:30,659 --> 01:50:33,119
capabilities so to suppose topology but

2694
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,040
also other other additional capabilities

2695
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,420
that we are proposing in the auto

2696
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,820
working group so the the general answer

2697
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:41,280
to uh the answer to your custom will be

2698
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,040
yes we are going in in that digression

2699
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:47,340
and yeah so the idea will be to to make

2700
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,860
all this information available in such a

2701
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:52,020
way that we can optimize the liberty or

2702
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:55,340
the usage of the network in general

2703
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:57,659
thank you

2704
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:02,480
thanks and I think Sanjay is next

2705
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:06,179
hi this is Sanjay Mishra um I think this

2706
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:07,440
is a very good presentation and very

2707
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,520
useful

2708
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,340
um one question I have is that so I get

2709
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:14,580
the the association of bid and the IP

2710
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,940
subnet now how important is the that

2711
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,739
relationship with the CDN streamers

2712
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:21,840
because I assume that content is

2713
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,760
replicated on all the CDN streamers

2714
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,679
right so that information pretty much

2715
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,060
remains static

2716
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:30,060
well the contents are not in all the the

2717
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,560
streamers I mean

2718
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,659
it could buy I mean you don't have the

2719
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,820
same information in all the streamers

2720
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:38,340
okay so not necessarily okay the content

2721
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,980
may not be necessarily yes so in that

2722
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:43,020
way you want to make sure that for a

2723
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:44,520
given request then you have to have

2724
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,679
extra logic to force

2725
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:49,380
that's IP subnet to always fetch content

2726
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:51,199
from that particular streamer then yes

2727
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:53,820
this astrologic for instance with the

2728
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,800
would perform this filtering that I

2729
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,300
commented before in the question from

2730
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,840
very deep and so would I come presented

2731
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,820
to this is simply how we expose the

2732
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:04,619
information but yeah the logic

2733
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:07,560
in the CDN side will need to get a lot

2734
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,659
of more things so filtering and then

2735
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:11,099
taking into account where the the

2736
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:13,619
content is and so on so this is this

2737
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:15,420
that development is also in progress

2738
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,239
okay thank you thank you

2739
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:21,360
thank you great thank you and Kyle has

2740
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,800
again closed the queue I don't see

2741
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,060
anybody trying to rush that block

2742
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:29,219
uh thank you very much

2743
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:31,920
all right we are at the time of any

2744
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,780
other business are there any other

2745
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:37,340
points we should be covering today

2746
01:52:42,599 --> 01:52:44,340
anyone

2747
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:46,619
anyone

2748
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:49,440
if not I think we are

2749
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,659
we will declare victory for today uh

2750
01:52:51,659 --> 01:52:53,040
thank you all very much for coming out

2751
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,920
and um thank you again Chris for taking

2752
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,380
such wonderful notes

2753
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:59,580
um and we will see you all on the

2754
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:02,540
mailing list thank you

2755
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:18,900
you'll be right back

2756
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:21,080
foreign
