okay that's it that's enough

101
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
back to the regular schedule program

102
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
uh so everything you say is

103
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,560
uh kind of recorded property of iotf is

104
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
a very simple summary of the note well

105
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,400
uh but there are a lot of documents

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
below by the way which is very useful in

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
the links if you haven't looked through

108
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,240
the documents

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
for

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
the meeting and

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
ietf sessions and ietf work they

112
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
actually do change once in a while so

113
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
you might want to refresh your memory if

114
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
you haven't

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,878
but you saw this when you registered

116
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
all right this is the agenda um a little

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
bit over on mice oh just live up here um

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,639
no well agenda bashing is there any

119
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
additions from anyone uh

120
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
we have kristoff covering layout um

121
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,958
issues chucks on the news security and

122
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
rdma

123
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
tom is going to be talking about issues

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,958
with the open and delegation operations

125
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,919
and then

126
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
client recovery

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
so under agenda i thought like i mean

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
the last last one you have like was the

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
road map of the working group would

130
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
would

131
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
need more than 20 minutes to i shall

132
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,959
come to an

133
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
prospective conclusion

134
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
so i was thinking like if we can

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
run some of the discussions really short

136
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
and have more

137
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
time allocation for the last discussion

138
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
if that is possible

139
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
i can give you ten minutes out of my two

140
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
presents okay great just just for the

141
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
presenters to think about it okay did

142
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
you say your name would you like the

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,279
microphone sorry

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
i had transported it again

145
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
thanks

146
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
uh and then i i'm sorry i really do have

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
to and then i just i clear you after you

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240


149
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,080
uh so no changes anybody updates updates

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
we're gonna try to move forward and then

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
we have the discussion at the end

152
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
okay that was a no

153
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
all right uh up is

154
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,680
uh kristoff

155
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
yeah hold yeah now i gotta switch horses

156
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,160
hold on

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
this

158
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,320
yeah okay so the nvme mapping for the

159
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
scuzzy layout and we could straight jump

160
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,839
to the next slide because that one

161
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,480
doesn't have a lot of information

162
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
so background story is five years ago

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
we got rfc 8154

164
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
published which is

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
basically a revision of the block layout

166
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,800
that ties deeply into scuzzy concept

167
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
most importantly for his persistent

168
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
reservations and

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
device identification it turns out just

170
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
around the same time the whole storage

171
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,480
industry is all on the nvme hype that

172
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
does the same thing just different and

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,240
we somehow need to support that as well

174
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
and because of that

175
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,120
i pretty soon after started

176
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
a document that explains how to use that

177
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,760
layout with nvme in a way that doesn't

178
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
change the underwire protocol but

179
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
requires a lot of normative language how

180
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
to map nvme to scuzzy concepts that

181
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
fundamentally are the same but expressed

182
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
very differently

183
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
and the way

184
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
the initial version did that was to by

185
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
referencing a nvm express nvme document

186
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
that's called discussion translation

187
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
reference that

188
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
does this mapping but it does it rather

189
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
sloppily and isn't really up to the

190
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
standards that the ietf has for

191
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
normative documents

192
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
and because of that that document

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
lingered for a while

194
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
the next slide and i know dave and sarin

195
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
did another take on it and

196
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,959
but not a whole lot of things happened

197
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
for years so this year after chuck

198
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
started prodding we

199
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
put a lot of work into it like chuck and

200
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
dave and me and especially dave did a

201
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,399
lot of work to me so we know

202
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
yeah but you also did a whole lot of

203
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
work and chuck also did some nice work

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,279
and dave so we we finally got a team

205
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,440
instead of just people doing it and put

206
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,200
out a new version of it

207
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
which gets rid of gets rid of that

208
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
reference to the nvme stlr document and

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
instead puts in its own normative

210
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
language

211
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
and i think we're more or less ready to

212
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,639
have working group adoption for a status

213
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,519
track document we have like two

214
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
open issues and that goes to the next

215
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
slide

216
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
so one is

217
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,839
uh the on the wire protocol has the

218
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,800
concept of and designator for the device

219
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
ids

220
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
that is basically

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that binary blob that identifies the

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
device what type is a discussion has a

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
bunch of different types

224
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,839
so the two two of the three types

225
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
relevant in nvme actually three of the

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
three types

227
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
uh defined in nvme

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,079
map one two one to the concepts in skz

229
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
so what the current document does is

230
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
it reuses them and doesn't do any on the

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
wire changes so dave brought up an idea

232
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,279
that we would use

233
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
different identifiers

234
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
to show that we're talking about an nvme

235
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
device

236
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
which reduces the amount that the scope

237
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,519
how the client has to search for the

238
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
device

239
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,880
and might be a little easier to

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,279
understand for administrators or devops

241
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
the downside is

242
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
instead of just being a mapping document

243
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,760
this actually adds

244
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,079
new xdr on the wire i mean basically

245
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,199
just

246
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,120
two new code points but it's still a

247
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
change of the on the wire protocol

248
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
and the other question that's kind of

249
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
related to it is do we want to add a new

250
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
uuid designator type

251
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,199
so nvme and scuzzy both added a way to

252
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,959
define

253
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
um

254
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
device to do device identification with

255
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,440
an i with an ietf was at 4122 uuid

256
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
and we don't have that in the previous

257
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
rfc yet because scuzzy hadn't edited at

258
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
the times because he was adding it right

259
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,120
around the time and nvme also edited it

260
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
around the time so

261
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
if we want to change the wire protocol

262
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
anyway we should support that as well

263
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
and preferably also for scuzzy and not

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
just friendly me

265
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
and that's basically the two interesting

266
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,839
items we have left open and otherwise i

267
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,360
think we're

268
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
ready for nitpicking review and bashing

269
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
the document into submission

270
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
are there

271
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,639
sorry if you can hear me are there any

272
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,720
questions i i guess i just want to say i

273
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
disagree with exactly one thing you said

274
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,399
he said

275
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
you started off by saying there's this

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
fad or something like that of nvme um so

277
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,680
the thing is is that it's probably

278
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
become a lot more important

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,639
uh moving forward for this type of

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
application than a lot of other things

281
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
because of mb media fabric stuff yeah i

282
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
i don't want to get into the technical

283
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,800
discussion because i think it's often

284
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
more religious than technical but it's

285
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,160
the fact that

286
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,959
in shared storage and be me is a really

287
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,839
big thing

288
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,199
yeah so so

289
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,360
this i i do know that

290
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
my company's interested in this work and

291
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
i know that obviously your stuff that

292
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,800
you're working on and i think i've

293
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,759
and just to add it so an implementation

294
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
of this draft i have it for the linux

295
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
client and server and on the server it's

296
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
about 20 lines of code and on the client

297
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
it's two

298
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
versions the version without the

299
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,519
protocol

300
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,399
without the protocol changes yes

301
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,880
i'm sorry uh i got uh chuck lever at the

302
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
microphone

303
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
hi chuck lever um

304
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
a couple of comments

305
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
uh i would like to

306
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,920
propose moving this to a working group

307
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,000
document i think somebody has to do that

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
so let me let me do that

309
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
um

310
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
the second comment is right now it's an

311
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
informational the status of document is

312
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,360
informational i would like to see it

313
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
become a standards track document

314
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,519
because it it does have

315
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
some normative uh

316
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
statements in it that i think

317
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
really don't belong in an informative

318
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,279
document so

319
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,920
those are my two comments

320
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
okay thank you

321
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
uh the chair recognizes even with his

322
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,560
mask on david black

323
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
i'm in deep trouble

324
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
so i completely agree with everything

325
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
chuck just said in addition um

326
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
uh having been the source of some of the

327
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
open issues

328
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,639
i'm going to agree with where the draft

329
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,199
currently is let's get this document

330
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
done done quickly with no change to the

331
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,199
wire protocol and then and then if

332
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
somebody sees value in the uuid bring in

333
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,280
a separate draft to add the uuid

334
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,039
i'll take a note while we're talking

335
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
um

336
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
we got that

337
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
and the chair

338
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
richard schaffenegger

339
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
just uh

340
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
i haven't heard anything that would

341
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
block this from not being adopted and

342
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
quite the opposite i would also think

343
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
that uh having this document on the

344
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,559
standards track

345
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,080
is would be very valuable

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,480
all right

347
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,400
uh

348
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
can i get a virtual hum or a hump here

349
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,320
uh moved working group standards track

350
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
no protocol change and let's just get

351
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,559
this out the door

352
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
okay that was the best

353
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,760
so so so brian if you have the online

354
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
participants cannot harm so

355
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,799
there is a

356
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,679
raise up hand tool is that one everybody

357
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
on the online and on site can actually

358
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,160
vote for it so ask your question and use

359
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,720
the tool i think

360
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
all right i lost my chat tool i'm doing

361
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
it i'm doing it coming in coming in come

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,720
in come in

363
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,280
just for that

364
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,760
i had it and i lost it man

365
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,039
easiest thing to do rather than trying

366
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,320
to get the short hands tool to work

367
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
would be simply state the proposition

368
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,640
let's see if anybody objects does

369
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
anybody object to moving this document

370
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,840
to standards track and taking it on in

371
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
the working group with no protocol

372
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,840
changes

373
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
right not seeing any

374
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
objections without the case

375
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,679
okay

376
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,559
okay

377
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,039
thank you thanks

378
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,799
all right uh

379
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,679
next up is uh

380
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,159
thank you chuck weber um uh discuss

381
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,720
security uh rpc with tls let me pull you

382
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
slide that

383
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
i'll try to stay in the pink next oh

384
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,600
 sorry

385
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,640
okay next slide

386
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,240
uh the

387
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
publication of this particular document

388
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,000
has been a long time coming

389
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,640
it's it's always been a problem uh of

390
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
these three normative documents listed

391
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,159
on this slide

392
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
uh not being ready yet uh these

393
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,320
normatively cited in this particular

394
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,360
document

395
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,720
the two of them at the bottom of the

396
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
slide 9146 and 9147 are now published so

397
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,159
those are no longer blocking this

398
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
document

399
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,240
um the kitten document is now on off 48

400
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,919
at least when i checked a week and a

401
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
half ago which means it's well on its

402
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,960
way should be published any very very

403
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
soon in within weeks or less

404
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
um so this document is now in ref um

405
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
meaning we're

406
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
we're this close

407
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,559
to

408
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,679
to uh to uh being off 48 and mile 48 it

409
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,200
just means for those who don't know

410
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
that's just uh

411
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,559
the authors uh making final comments

412
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,159
before publication

413
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,720
next slide

414
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,960
um

415
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
there are still these two uh matters

416
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
that were discussed uh probably 18

417
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,840
months ago um

418
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,039
and i did i did mock these up in the

419
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,880
github repo for this document so if

420
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
anybody wants to go and look at them

421
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
they're available in uh in the github

422
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
version of this

423
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
we haven't made any changes to the

424
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,360
actual cued document that will happen

425
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
during off 48.

426
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
um i should say i did check to see how

427
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
long

428
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
this document has been waiting in the

429
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
rfc

430
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,760
editor's queue it's been 88 weeks

431
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,520
this is not the longest

432
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
awaiting document in the queue

433
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,799
right now there's one that's been

434
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,600
waiting since 2015.

435
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
so i count i count us as being lucky

436
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,399
i think this is a

437
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
not too much of a price to pay for it so

438
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,559
next slide

439
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,679
i just wanted to

440
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,240
mention the um implementations of this

441
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,799
standard that we have uh so far i think

442
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,320
three of these are

443
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,240
already listed in the actual draft um

444
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
the freebsd implementation is both

445
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
client server

446
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,520
um daisy has

447
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
a client and server user space

448
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,799
implementation which is based on java

449
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
hammer space

450
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,480
i'm told has both client and server

451
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,799
although it's not for nfs right now

452
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,480
um i'm working on the linux client

453
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,600
prototype

454
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
which is uh for for nfs

455
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
and uh ben connington has

456
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,799
produced uh an nginx module that can act

457
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,440
as a front end for a

458
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,200
box standard nfs server of any flavor

459
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
and do the rpc with tls translation in

460
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,960
front of it

461
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
um and he recently told me that he's

462
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,039
he's put up

463
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,679
on uh github i believe so that it's open

464
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,840
source and people can look at it

465
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,520
and he intends to

466
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,400
um ask for the nginx folks who to merge

467
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,840
it

468
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
um and he's actually

469
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
uh online

470
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,760
so if i said something wrong he can you

471
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
can speak up and tell me

472
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,678
the right version of that next slide

473
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
we've had decent uh community testing

474
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
exposure

475
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,640
um at the most recent one we had all the

476
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,320
implementations present from the last

477
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
slide that i mentioned

478
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
um and um

479
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
we were interoperating so um that's

480
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,799
going well next slide

481
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
um a little bit about the linux client

482
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
implementation i'm working on it's a

483
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
prototype

484
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
um there are a number of number of

485
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
issues that need to be

486
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
hashed out with

487
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
our upstream

488
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
fellows specifically in the

489
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
um

490
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,720
tls handshake mechanism

491
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120
right now the prototype uses an up call

492
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
which means that the kernel requests

493
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,919
a tls handshake from a user agent it

494
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,679
doesn't do it itself

495
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
the user agent then calls into a

496
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
standard tls library

497
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,919
to do the handshake

498
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,520
we support some

499
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,200
a new mount option

500
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
we've discussed among is there a

501
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,320
question

502
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,520
okay

503
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
we discussed among the various

504
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
implementers what this uh

505
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
administrative interface will look like

506
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,039
and this is sort of what we've come up

507
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,320
with so

508
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,480
we'll just add a mount option that

509
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,279
allows you to specify a tls or or not

510
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
um and uh the prototype is available on

511
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,720
uh

512
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,400
in my repo

513
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,559
github and on kernel.org next slide

514
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
so

515
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
last we talked about this um there were

516
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
some other standard actions um

517
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
that we were considering um

518
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,559
uh for example how um exchange id and

519
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,919
friends could use tls peer

520
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,360
authentication

521
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
uh in the same way that they use

522
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,159
kerberos today

523
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,080
um kerberos principles

524
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
um there hasn't been any progress there

525
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
um and the other thing we had

526
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
sort of uh extended conversations about

527
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,960
was

528
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,000
how servers can tell clients that if the

529
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
client wants to use offices

530
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
it must use

531
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,320
uh tls or some of some form to protect

532
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,520
the transport

533
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,640
um we've had a couple of proposals

534
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
in that arena but

535
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,679
um

536
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
they're not well liked

537
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
i had one called rpc tail suit of

538
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,400
flavors

539
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
um

540
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
i've gotten two thumbs down on that one

541
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
so i'm going to let that document expire

542
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
um and we can continue to explore

543
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,679
um basic uh basically not uh wire

544
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,640
changes but rather just conventions for

545
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,520
servers to communicate their

546
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
um security policy requirements uh via

547
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,480
existing

548
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,080
protocol elements rather than adding new

549
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
ones

550
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
um and we can take that conversation to

551
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,200
the list

552
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
uh next slide

553
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
oh i'm done yeah i was wondering

554
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,039
i do get previews over here

555
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
all right um and and so what's the ask

556
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
here

557
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
um what's the this is a progress uh

558
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,960
report implement implementation status

559
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,320
um

560
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
i guess i'm asking whether people agree

561
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
that uh

562
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,679
letting rpc tlsu flavors expire

563
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
gracefully is uh

564
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
what we would like to do and then

565
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
continue the conversation on

566
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
um uh

567
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,679
soliciting other proposals for that for

568
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,720
that uh

569
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,000
requirement about servers nfs servers um

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
indicating that they want stronger uh

571
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,159
transport layer security for offices

572
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,360
okay i got it too i know that's a long

573
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,399
no no i got i got so first um let's suit

574
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,520
the flavors

575
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,799
expire any uh any objection to that

576
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
online can you check it

577
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,320
should we hear from uh ben cadec first

578
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,320
sure

579
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
yeah just to mention real quick the

580
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
kitten

581
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,360
tls13 channel bindings document was

582
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
literally published as an rfc during

583
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,200
this session so it's roc 9266 now

584
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
yay

585
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,200
so that should free you up to uh to get

586
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
into auth48 for this one

587
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,279
thank you ben oh very cool thank you

588
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
uh so i don't think it was an objection

589
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,960
there i think nobody objected uh

590
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
the next thing was uh let's take this to

591
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
the list and

592
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
discuss the do you want to

593
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,399
how do we handle this and just

594
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,240
description yeah um uh mr novak and rick

595
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
macklin both had some ideas about how

596
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,880
they wanted to go uh rick's proposal was

597
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
um

598
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,360
he had a couple of um

599
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
uh he used some pre-existing protocol

600
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
elements for both nfs v3 and nfs v4

601
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,320
servers to indicate requirements for

602
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,720
transport layer security

603
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,799
um so we should probably just um

604
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,960
reinvigorate that conversation

605
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,919
on the on the mailing list

606
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
okay

607
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
and there was a third thing that was

608
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,919
that's why that's good enough okay okay

609
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,360
cool

610
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,640
uh anything else online in room

611
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,360
okay thanks chuck

612
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,399
ready oh you

613
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,600
we are gonna do the next one which is

614
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
surprisingly

615
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,159
uh sure and go right to the second slide

616
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,440
right

617
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
not sure why we even bother with title

618
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,919
slides

619
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,840
because we're just that kind of people

620
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
well for me the title side and the

621
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
supplemental material are for people who

622
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
are looking at these online after the

623
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
after the fact

624
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,640
um

625
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
so i've been working on this version two

626
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
of rpc over already may

627
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
i did a little prototyping about a year

628
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,679
ago

629
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,600
it's very limited in scope and hasn't

630
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,039
really changed since last time i

631
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,799
presented on this topic

632
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,360
next slide

633
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,720
um the concern a year ago was that um if

634
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
we wanted to support message chaining

635
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,039
properly we really need to have a

636
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
a full a full-on flow control protocol

637
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,440
built into our pc of already made we

638
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,480
don't have that in version one um so

639
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
over the last year i've worked with john

640
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
a gar to

641
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,559
fix that to rectify that

642
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
we have it the description is written in

643
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,760
section 4.2.1 now

644
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
i don't think there's been any further

645
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,799
review of that

646
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
but i believe it

647
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,480
addresses all the concerns that we had

648
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
about flow control

649
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,720
so that part of the protocol i think is

650
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,519
now ready next slide

651
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,919
um dave novak had a concern that we

652
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,600
can't expect the iesg to

653
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
sanction a new version of a protocol

654
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
that doesn't address

655
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
security especially transport layer

656
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
security and

657
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,240
rpc of rdma doesn't have any security in

658
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
it

659
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,399
um so his proposal

660
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,960
was to add a mechanism in the protocol

661
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
to exchange

662
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,159
certificate material or authentication

663
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,840
with their material

664
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,000
i would rather see us use build on uh

665
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,760
existing security protocols that are

666
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,240
more sophisticated like tlsv 1.3

667
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
so that we have

668
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
underneath rpc over rdma

669
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,279
um the transport of the rdma

670
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,320
verbs etc etc are protected in the same

671
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,120
way that tls protects um

672
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,960
communications on tcp

673
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,519
next slide

674
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,000
so i guess it goes without saying that

675
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
the itf doesn't have any authority over

676
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,440
infiniband rocky opa but it does have

677
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,919
authority over iwarp

678
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,159
and we could

679
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,799
specify iwarp on

680
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,440
quick or we could specify eyewear upon

681
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
tls

682
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,760
i suggested this tom talpy recently and

683
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,799
he directed me to section 5.4.2

684
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,000
of rfc 5042

685
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,320
um which i've read several times and i

686
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
don't find it

687
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
convincing

688
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,399
um

689
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,240
that's not something we need to go into

690
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,279
here

691
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,120
but um i just thought maybe it would be

692
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
interesting to consider

693
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,440
uh specification of ddp and rd map on

694
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,399
quick um but maybe that's more than we

695
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,919
ever want to take on

696
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,080
so

697
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,159
um at this point

698
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:16,960
yeah

699
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,799
so i don't know what to it's an open

700
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,320
question how we will deal with transport

701
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
layer security um for rpc already rdma

702
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
if we want to continue

703
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
uh work on this protocol

704
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
which i will get to in a moment but

705
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,200
first

706
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
they have black

707
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,120
hmm

708
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
the layering on quick might not be

709
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,720
anywhere near as bad as you think it

710
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,760
would be because the time that we did

711
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
uh our i did i warp which is in on mpa

712
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,279
and ddp

713
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,760
we also did a fairly quick mapping of

714
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,840
that onto

715
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,360
sctp i guess what i'm not clear about is

716
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,240
uh what the goal this exercise is are we

717
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,640
trying to write something or get it past

718
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,279
the iesg are we trying to spec something

719
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,279
that's likely to get deployed

720
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,440
yes

721
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,760
i remain confused

722
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
um

723
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
i i think both

724
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
um

725
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
i would like to see something that is

726
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,560
useful to people

727
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,480
um we certainly do need to

728
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,359
guarantee that that uh the isg

729
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,040
especially sector is not going to

730
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,079
complain about what we're proposing

731
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,520
okay so david black again my

732
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
i suspect we're going to wind up having

733
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,960
to get into a discussion of what do we

734
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,879
expect to see in the hardware data paths

735
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,079
because

736
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,280
that's going to be a strong influence

737
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
over what's deployable

738
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,399
i want to recognize tom yeah uh

739
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,638
tom

740
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,639
hi

741
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,719
soundcheck can you hear me

742
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,879
yes yes good

743
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,599
um uh chuck yeah i mean the

744
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,119
there's a couple of concerns about

745
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,680
putting rpc over our dma in charge of

746
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,880
security

747
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,839
in that rdma will be basically

748
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,200
transferring

749
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
you know encrypted bits so the software

750
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,599
layer of rpc rdma has to decrypt it so

751
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,800
you loot some

752
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,079
performance

753
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,599
that's not a very compelling

754
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,200
architecture

755
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
um i can agree i agree

756
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,520
okay um second you know there's rocky

757
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,760
which has no security whatsoever

758
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
um i wore which referred to ipsec

759
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,359
um

760
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,359
i work over quick i agree with david

761
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,359
it's a tractable problem i think it's a

762
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,040
fairly significant problem we deferred

763
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,320
that work because at the time we wanted

764
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,440
to do it a few years ago quick wasn't uh

765
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
fully specified

766
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,720
now that it is

767
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
maybe not the datagram service part of

768
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,280
it but um you know there's there's a

769
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,119
possibility now but the

770
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
discussion at the time was to have a

771
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,000
quick extension specifically for

772
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,520
rdma

773
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,079
and uh that's a bit more of a problem

774
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,560
than just simply mapping rdma to a quick

775
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
uh stream

776
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,599
so

777
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,760
i think there's some thinking to be done

778
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,560
there

779
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,079
but all those would be much better

780
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,640
solutions than slapping tls into rpc

781
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,000
over rdma in my opinion

782
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,920
well i'm up for it i mean you you know

783
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,119
that i'm still

784
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
engaged on iwarp even though the

785
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
industry seems to be drifting slowly

786
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
away from it i think it would be a great

787
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,160
effort for itf

788
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,480
yeah i'm happy to uh entertain

789
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
more conversation about this uh on the

790
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,599
mailing list

791
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,520
or privately

792
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,440
go ahead

793
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,720
um

794
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
okay uh so richard

795
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,960
just just in high level observation i

796
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
would strongly refrain from doing any

797
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,359
private security whatsoever in a

798
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,960
protocol at this level

799
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
so i'm

800
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,560
sorry that he's not here but i would

801
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
really not support that

802
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
uh how the layering at the end of the

803
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,440
day then is done

804
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
um

805
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
yes there will be secure

806
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,560
performance implications if you do it

807
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,520
with rdma over tls you can do

808
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,440
the layering the other way around so

809
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,119
that you can do

810
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,440
some hardware offloading there

811
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,760
people that really want to have security

812
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,560
they

813
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,079
typically don't care about performance

814
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,280
that much in my opinion

815
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,599
well they do care but

816
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,920
you know depending on on which on who's

817
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
well stronger than um is is getting the

818
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
is getting the the the thing that they

819
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,680
want color me a pollyanna but you know i

820
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
like to think that in some day in the

821
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
near future that we can have both

822
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,359
security and performance

823
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,839
um especially with offload solutions

824
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,280
so um

825
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
i'm optimistic

826
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
security will always be a bump in the

827
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
road so yeah but anyway

828
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,760
my main point was not to do an any any

829
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,480
uh custom solution to this problem here

830
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,640
in this group but use a standard

831
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
industry standard uh security

832
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
um uh protocol and again how the

833
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,160
layering is then done ultimately is that

834
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,520
that's the sound that's something that

835
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
the group needs to decide yeah i that's

836
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
my personal view as well

837
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,640
okay um

838
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,400
i have uh christoph hellwig on uh

839
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,119
mike and then tom kelby

840
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,119
yeah so i i don't think uh security and

841
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,920
performance really are that far apart

842
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,040
right both both with existing

843
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,480
uh tls offloads with ssds we absolutely

844
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
know there's hardware encryption engines

845
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,640
that do line rate without any problems

846
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
but for that

847
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,760
we need a good enough standard that they

848
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
can implement

849
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,200
which brings me to the next question

850
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,119
i'll step aside

851
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,119
i'll just emphasize

852
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,400
and

853
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
someone's kind of specified this and i

854
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,480
don't think this is the nfs people and

855
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,000
given that storm has disappeared and

856
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,440
i know there's a lot of discussions

857
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
about this working group disappearing i

858
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,560
think we need to have a good

859
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,720
conversation about maybe

860
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
grouping that kind of work in a new

861
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
working group that

862
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,119
includes

863
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,560
a broader group of people with

864
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,040
applicable skills

865
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,920
okay um so christoph i totally agree we

866
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
want the broadest skills when

867
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,160
when nfs v4 was going to take over rdma

868
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
the the discussion was that all the rdma

869
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,640
experts were already hanging around

870
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,160
nfsv4

871
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,800
so to the extent that we branch out of

872
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,200
nfs and rdma

873
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,320
uses

874
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,800
we need the additional expertise that's

875
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,119
present in itf like if we go for quick

876
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,440
obviously we engage the quick group

877
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,240
but um richard if if somebody deploys

878
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,319
rdma they absolutely want performance

879
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,040
that's the reason to deploy rdma and

880
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,200
security is mandatory to implement these

881
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,880
days nobody can

882
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
design or deploy an insecure protocol so

883
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,800
you need both performance and security

884
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,839
absolutely at all times

885
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
unfortunately i think i need to move on

886
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,480
so

887
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
okay that's the next slide

888
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
uh it's recently uh come to my attention

889
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,839
that

890
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,079
read plus is kind of more critical than

891
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,839
i thought

892
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,520
originally we looked at read plus and

893
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,599
said that's going to be difficult to fit

894
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,079
into the rdma paradigm because the

895
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,680
client doesn't know in advance what the

896
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
reply is going to look like it could

897
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,800
look like a single

898
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,240
uh

899
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,760
content data

900
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,720
segment

901
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,920
or it could be some set of uh

902
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,839
content data and content whole and

903
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,599
there's no predicting and so it was

904
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,760
impossible for the client to be able to

905
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,400
set up a reasonable set of rdma

906
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
registered memory

907
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,520
to receive

908
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,839
replies in general so

909
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,880
our

910
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,480
upper layer bindings

911
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,440
have

912
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,560
therefore

913
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,520
not permitted any uh resulting items in

914
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,839
replus to be eligible for a direct data

915
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,359
placement

916
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,119
um however it's been pointed out to me

917
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,280
that um

918
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,160
uh certain file systems will start doing

919
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,440
a whole instantiation when um reads

920
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,400
happen

921
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,079
over uh um unwritten extents

922
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,720
um so rate plus is a is a

923
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,599
really good idea for large sparse files

924
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,319
where you want to keep the sparseness

925
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,880
um so i think we and of course we do

926
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,640
want to serve large sparse files over

927
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,920
rdma

928
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
those are important of course in hvc as

929
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,640
well as in the cloud for uh

930
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
virtual disks so

931
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,079
um

932
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,280
i'd like to

933
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
just sort of throw this out here and say

934
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
we need to think a little bit

935
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
more carefully about how replus needs to

936
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,079
work over rdma um either we need a

937
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,200
convention

938
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,680
that explains how to make it work um at

939
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,760
least for the simple cases or we

940
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,240
actually need to extend either

941
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
rdma or

942
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,040
um nfsv 4.2 replus to make this work

943
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
correctly and this is something that can

944
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
be deferred to the list

945
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,520
next slide

946
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
um

947
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,920
we had some performance goals for v2

948
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,680
when we started this project a few years

949
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
ago and i think that most of them have

950
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,880
been met they'll either be met by the

951
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
piano bus layout type that kristoff

952
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,319
described earlier

953
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,880
or um they will be met in practice with

954
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
the um

955
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,640
private data extension that we did in

956
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,960
rfc 8797

957
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,200
so i think the urgency for our version 2

958
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
is less than it used to be

959
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,640
um and my concern is as it was last time

960
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
represented that

961
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,920
we don't have

962
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,119
more than one

963
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,280
version two prototype right now i don't

964
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,920
see more than that happening

965
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
so there really isn't a an

966
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,400
interoperability issue there um

967
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,920
there are loads of other projects in

968
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,520
front of the working group right now

969
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,599
that i think are higher priority um

970
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,319
especially tls related issues

971
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,160
um

972
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,000
and there's really only one person who's

973
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,040
available to prototype author review and

974
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,720
perhaps steward

975
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,800
this document so

976
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,560
um

977
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,000
here's where i do put this in front of

978
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the group um maybe we should just let

979
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,680
this work expire

980
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,839
for now and leave it to come back at

981
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,599
some later point when we might have more

982
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,720
resources to bring to bear

983
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,599
do you want i'm interested in opinions

984
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,720
thoughts comments

985
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,680
i think letting it expire is the wrong

986
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,640
term it just kind of let it sit right

987
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,440
um

988
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,720
it's uh

989
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,640
well the you know physically the draft

990
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,280
will expire but it's still out there and

991
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
it can still be discussed and we can

992
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
reactivate it when it makes sense so

993
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
yeah what you described makes good sense

994
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,599
i just the terminology of expired

995
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,720
doesn't sound right to me

996
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,960
yeah i was referring issues strictly to

997
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,520
the mechanism rather than to

998
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,280
anything if you're going to give it up

999
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,720
implications

1000
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
okay

1001
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,160
well drafts expire all the time don't be

1002
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,319
afraid of an expired draft and it's not

1003
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,880
necessary to refresh drafts i see people

1004
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
doing that they make no changes just to

1005
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,480
keep it active it's not necessary

1006
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,440
okay oops sorry i went back into queue i

1007
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
don't want to do that

1008
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,920
oh okay i'm gonna kick you out

1009
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
i click click the wrong button sorry

1010
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,399
bye

1011
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,359
yeah you scared kristoff christoph was

1012
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,480
going to come up and say something but

1013
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,240
then you just scared him off that's

1014
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,040
kristoff alex

1015
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,000
so i i don't think great plus really is

1016
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,440
a protocol

1017
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,200
problem i know we have some

1018
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
implementation problems on the linux

1019
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,319
site but

1020
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,880
read plus can always do a short read so

1021
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,560
you can always just return one chunk of

1022
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
data in one hole and let the client

1023
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
retry which i guess for most cases is

1024
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,078
simply the right thing to do

1025
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,119
sorry

1026
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,240
uh believers nodding his head sagely

1027
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,920
uh no

1028
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,960
i would call it sage but

1029
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,520
we should yeah we should talk later um

1030
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,280
there are there are some

1031
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
there are some uh more subtle issues

1032
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
about direct data placement that uh make

1033
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,319
me a little concerned but if we can find

1034
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,920
a way of making it work

1035
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,319
um i think the the benefits of not

1036
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,280
triggering whole instantiation are are

1037
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,319
real and strong and uh important

1038
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,160
so

1039
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,880
all right um

1040
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,480
so back to the back the question of uh

1041
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,440
any objection to letting this draft

1042
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,280
expire in the ietf sense and uh and if

1043
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,920
needed we will pick up the work in the

1044
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,200
future

1045
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,599
but at this point chuck is saying that

1046
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,560
the gains are not there to warrant

1047
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,359
the effort nor the resources to take

1048
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,359
forward the v2

1049
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,839
rpc already made route

1050
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,760
any objection

1051
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,000
to dropping work

1052
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,560
and freeing up bandwidth so we can

1053
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,400
focus on more important things

1054
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
nothing

1055
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,400
thank you okay let's see what's on the

1056
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,560
next slide

1057
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,040
that's for uh

1058
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,200
i think we should deliver remove the

1059
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,880
milestone for delivering these documents

1060
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
because that's not going to happen yeah

1061
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,160
and i think we just agreed to that okay

1062
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,839
good next slide

1063
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,160
okay done good

1064
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,240
uh thank you chuck for being clear

1065
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,599
pickaxe

1066
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,680
[Laughter]

1067
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
if i've ever heard that before

1068
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,040
uh could you get a chair for the

1069
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,520
microphone

1070
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,800
uh tom

1071
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,079
delegation hold on i'm fine at the front

1072
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,280
of the doctor

1073
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,960
focus focus pulaski focus

1074
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,960
[Music]

1075
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
this one market

1076
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,200
layouts impeding file recovery

1077
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,640
no the the other one another one

1078
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,200
no sorry

1079
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,359
they're out of order right never mind i

1080
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,520
got it

1081
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,119
and i just noticed when i got up here

1082
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,960
that i didn't provide my email but you

1083
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
can figure it out

1084
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,720
so a delegation of state id is going to

1085
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,520
the next slide please

1086
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,280
so

1087
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,200
i i call it delegation of state ids

1088
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,760
because and or open because it's mainly

1089
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,599
about the delegation of attributes from

1090
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,160
the server to the clients

1091
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,000
most get adders are done but you know

1092
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,760
while the file is opened by the client

1093
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,760
so we want to move

1094
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,920
remove the the client from asking the

1095
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,040
server about the attributes

1096
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,759
next slide please

1097
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,160
so i thought i'd give some some dates we

1098
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,119
first published it in april 2018

1099
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,720
we've had a hammer space has had a

1100
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
private server application since that

1101
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,200
time we've also had an open source

1102
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,240
client implementation since that time

1103
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,440
and the linux flight maintainer kind of

1104
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,480
is a

1105
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,680
um

1106
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,960
i want to say hard-ass well i'll say

1107
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,880
hard-ass about this

1108
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,520
and he he doesn't like to take changes

1109
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,240
that haven't been ietf standard track

1110
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,040
documents because it clears up ipr

1111
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,240
concerns

1112
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,480
and open standards equates to open

1113
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,680
source

1114
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,559
right so i'm trying to get this

1115
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,280
uh

1116
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,040
the

1117
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,760
him to push the changes upstream as they

1118
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,839
call it and he won't do this until i get

1119
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,680
this more

1120
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,078
solid

1121
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,119
and so

1122
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,200
you know the work is the the documents

1123
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
written i've let it slide for a year or

1124
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,680
two while covid was going on

1125
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,640
and

1126
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,319
i want to push it into working group

1127
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,040
last call get a document shepard etc and

1128
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,599
push it on

1129
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,240
yeah

1130
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,720
um so basically the ask here is to

1131
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,200
is there any objection

1132
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,480
to taking the state id document yeah

1133
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,839
forward um to a working group last

1134
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,280
call

1135
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,480
and attaching a document shepard to it

1136
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,760
any

1137
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,720
any objections

1138
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,559
yes

1139
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,559
okay any objections

1140
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,480
okay up

1141
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,200
tom talfi

1142
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,640
question

1143
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,319
tom you said there's an implementation

1144
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,440
in the client is there also an

1145
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,160
implementation on the server and

1146
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,920
so the the implement this the server is

1147
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,359
the hammer space private server

1148
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,119
so we

1149
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,119
yeah

1150
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,880
is there any other implementer

1151
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
interested in this

1152
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
feature

1153
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,440
i i don't know i haven't talked to

1154
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,599
anyone who's interested in it

1155
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,720
that sounds

1156
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,200
right but you know the

1157
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,880
we're the only yeah i know it's not it's

1158
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
not your responsibility to convince

1159
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,760
others but um i just curious how broad

1160
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,760
the interest in this might be

1161
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,240
if it's been idle for a year or two

1162
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,280
one might ask is it gonna reawaken

1163
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,040
outside of hammer space

1164
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,440
i don't know

1165
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,599
i i don't know i mean

1166
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,599
you know i don't have any objection i'm

1167
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,319
just

1168
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,480
raising the question because it seems

1169
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,599
yeah

1170
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,839
yeah

1171
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,079
that's all

1172
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,319
thanks

1173
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,200
okay

1174
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,440
so

1175
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,359
we still stand with no objection to

1176
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,078
moving forward

1177
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,520
um all right

1178
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,640
thank you uh

1179
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,879
i'm

1180
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,359
this is the one i was going to grab

1181
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,359
before

1182
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,640
i think

1183
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,640
so

1184
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,400
my next presentation is about layout

1185
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
competing file recovery

1186
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,680
um if we go to the next slide please

1187
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,160
so the problem statement is when a

1188
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,880
server reboots we have a grace period

1189
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,800
for the that allows the client to

1190
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,559
reclaim open files

1191
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
the server doesn't necessarily know that

1192
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,040
which files are opened by the client so

1193
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,599
the client just is informed that the the

1194
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,160
server is rebooted and it knows it has a

1195
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,680
set amount of time

1196
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,520
to to reclaim those files if it's

1197
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,839
interested in reclaiming them

1198
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,240
and it can use the claim previous with

1199
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,480
the open to which is typically only

1200
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,440
valid during that reclaim period to say

1201
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,200
i had this file open

1202
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,160
i want to reclaim it and keep it open

1203
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,079
and

1204
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,440
we

1205
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,839
we we have that but we we never

1206
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,599
considered what happens if the client

1207
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,359
had encountered errors

1208
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,920
before the server restarted

1209
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,920
right and if the client does this it

1210
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,359
doesn't have enough state to inform the

1211
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,160
server that you know errors had occurred

1212
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,558
next slide

1213
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,640
and so

1214
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,160
what what happens when these errors

1215
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,160
occur and that depends on whether we're

1216
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,880
strongly or loosely coupled right so a

1217
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,680
strongly coupled system is one in which

1218
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,599
the the mds and the ds have a private

1219
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,839
um

1220
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,240
it's it's private protocol in which they

1221
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,520
can

1222
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,240
communicate state changes and errors

1223
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,520
that have occurred

1224
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,160
and everything a loosely one is one in

1225
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,800
which we use a storage protocol like nfs

1226
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,119
in order to communicate those changes

1227
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,200
and that's very limiting

1228
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,359
right so the loosely

1229
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,319
a loosely coupled system is one pre uh

1230
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,319
pretty much which you

1231
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,319
have several different proprietors

1232
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,480
proprietary code bases for the servers

1233
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,200
so

1234
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
with the strongly coupled the mds

1235
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,920
already knows the error from the ds

1236
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,799
right

1237
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,720
it can report it with loosely coupled

1238
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,559
it depends on the clients to report the

1239
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,000
error so you might report it with a

1240
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,720
layout return or a layer of error but we

1241
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,680
just

1242
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,760
restarted so the state ids for the

1243
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,880
layouts are no longer valid

1244
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,760
after the restart

1245
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,000
please

1246
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,760
so can't we just get a new layout and

1247
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,079
then report the error well

1248
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,400
again this we have a complication if we

1249
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,559
have client-side mirroring

1250
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,359
um

1251
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,640
actually even without client-side

1252
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,160
mirroring the server may have moved the

1253
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,960
file the data instances of the file to

1254
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,440
different data servers so it's no longer

1255
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,200
possible to report errors that had

1256
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,598
occurred

1257
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,359
next slide please

1258
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,040
so what's the importance of reporting

1259
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,960
the errors well if we report the errors

1260
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,040
it allows with client-side mirroring it

1261
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,920
allows the the mds to pick

1262
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,640
which one of the the instances are valid

1263
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,359
and should be re-silvered if it doesn't

1264
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,040
have that then

1265
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
it has to scan all the files assume all

1266
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,880
the ones that weren't reported as errors

1267
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
may be an error

1268
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,000
and uh

1269
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,280
go across all the files

1270
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,440
and the the cost of it depends on the

1271
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,960
size of the files and the number of open

1272
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,640
files

1273
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,400
i feel like i'm going fast but i always

1274
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,440
do

1275
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,240
next slide please

1276
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,240
so

1277
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,400
i'll present two potential solutions and

1278
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,319
of course i've picked one already but

1279
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,359
i'm just

1280
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,599
trying to show that we did consider this

1281
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,760
um we could introduce new operations

1282
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,200
which would allow the server and the

1283
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,640
client to agree

1284
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,520
that

1285
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,079
uh the server has this capability and

1286
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,760
then the client knows that since the

1287
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,839
server is advertising this ability it

1288
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,839
can then use that ability

1289
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,880
or

1290
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,480
we can use the special state id on

1291
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,079
layout return and define some new

1292
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,960
semantics during the grace period

1293
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,359
i picked to find the new semantics with

1294
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,480
um

1295
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,520
the special state id

1296
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,920
so the special state id is defined not

1297
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,720
to be valid with layout return and if it

1298
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,799
is presented with layout return

1299
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,680
uh

1300
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,240
the server returns nfs4 error that state

1301
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,359
id

1302
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,760
but if it's inside the grace period we

1303
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,599
could have it we could understand that

1304
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,400
this the client is saying i encountered

1305
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,270
an error when i was trying to

1306
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,720
[Music]

1307
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,960
when i was writing to this layout i want

1308
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,960
to report it and if you're capable of

1309
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,880
using that information use it if not

1310
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,079
go ahead

1311
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,119
so that

1312
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,359
if the server was inside the grace

1313
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,920
period was returned bad state id the the

1314
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,520
client would know that

1315
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,359
the feature was not supported

1316
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,680
there's no need for layout error because

1317
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,040
layout error implies that you're going

1318
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,760
to reuse the layout state id afterwards

1319
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,680
and we're not going to

1320
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,359
and then there's no need to reclaim the

1321
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,079
file because the client has already said

1322
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,119
here's what's happened with the file

1323
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,400
i don't need it open all right

1324
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,799
next slide please

1325
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,559
the big question is where to put this i

1326
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,640
could tack it on to dell state id but i

1327
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,119
don't like that because it del state id

1328
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,040
is pretty close to being done

1329
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,079
and i don't think it fits in with it all

1330
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,559
right it is about open files but that's

1331
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,599
kind of stretching it for me

1332
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
i could do a new document

1333
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,599
but it starts a new cycle

1334
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,480
it's only two to three pages and

1335
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,799
the next topic and the

1336
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,319
working in

1337
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,520
is about what are we going to do with

1338
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,400
the working group so

1339
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,880
i guess the the the open question i have

1340
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,280
is where do i put it

1341
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,680
and if other people are interested in as

1342
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,720
tom talfi would point out

1343
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,200
you're trying to think about a phrase a

1344
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,000
question here what's your ask you phrase

1345
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,839
a

1346
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,520
question i'm helping join the cube all

1347
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,040
right tom you phrase the question

1348
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,640
the big question i'll leave that to you

1349
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,559
i was just going to ask tom if it's only

1350
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,480
two or three pages what does it say what

1351
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,920
kind of normative statements does it

1352
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,119
make

1353
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,400
i'm sorry

1354
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,960
it's about what um if we were to go back

1355
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,480
a couple of slides about

1356
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,440
the

1357
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
the presence of the special state id

1358
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,680
during the grace period versus not in

1359
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,000
the grace period and how the client can

1360
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,839
determine whether or not the server

1361
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,480
supports this feature

1362
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,720
and those are those are musts

1363
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,960
they're not just you know

1364
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,200
figure it out kind of a thing

1365
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,319
it seems

1366
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,319
kind of heavy-handed to make it so

1367
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,040
normative somehow but okay

1368
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,520
no i i appreciate the feedback i mean

1369
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,200
i'm struggling with where this goes

1370
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,200
myself

1371
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,559
well i guess my suggestion is if you can

1372
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,240
find a way to make it

1373
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,680
subnormative

1374
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,920
you know if it's sort of a behavior it's

1375
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,760
a way of implementing it

1376
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,599
then it's easy right you just publish a

1377
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,280
simple note

1378
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,520
okay

1379
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,079
i can't form a question i can't form a

1380
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,520
question i think

1381
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,559
my suggestion is to

1382
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,520
take a step back and put make a proposal

1383
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,760
unless to uh

1384
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,079
to the working to the working rebellious

1385
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,119
uh in the next two weeks okay um but uh

1386
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,839
chuck leaver please chuck lever i agree

1387
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,000
with that um

1388
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,839
uh following up on what uh mr talby said

1389
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,079
uh making this a convention seems

1390
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,000
appropriate rather than

1391
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,760
something that's normative

1392
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,079
um it seems pretty straightforward for a

1393
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,000
client to try this

1394
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,960
uh and the server says uh what the

1395
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
uh the client goes okay this is isn't

1396
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,520
working i fall back to whatever the old

1397
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,400
and otherwise it will do something more

1398
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,079
reasonable right

1399
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:00,960
um

1400
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,559
so in other words it wouldn't require

1401
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,240
any action by this by the working group

1402
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,240
at all

1403
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,680
okay

1404
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,200
just just a thought

1405
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,920
so but uh all right i'll talk later i'm

1406
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,160
i'm so used to normative documents

1407
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,520
i don't go with the other workflow

1408
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,839
okay so

1409
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,559
you hit your button i wanted to say one

1410
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,000
thing back to tom

1411
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,359
a normative

1412
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,319
document states a protocol that needs to

1413
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,319
be interoperable by everybody in a

1414
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,119
specific way and this doesn't sound like

1415
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,359
it's quite the same thing so

1416
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,920
it may not even need a document it may

1417
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,359
just be the way you implement it

1418
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,359
again

1419
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,079
same deal as the previous one okay

1420
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,880
well so you know it's always better to

1421
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,640
be clear and write a document i'm not

1422
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,480
trying to say get around it or anything

1423
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,039
like that it just if it doesn't rise to

1424
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,760
a requirement that everybody must do

1425
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,640
even if it's optional it it's like

1426
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,039
maybe this isn't really a protocol

1427
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,880
question okay

1428
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,799
just it's just food for thought that's

1429
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,240
all thank you oh thank you very much

1430
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,200
okay i still think we're at the and

1431
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,880
we're gonna you're gonna

1432
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,520
noodle frame and take to the alleys

1433
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,760
within the next two weeks

1434
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,440
that written down i think i got it now

1435
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,240
okay

1436
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,559
all right that brings us

1437
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,000
i think to the end of the presentations

1438
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
hold on let me

1439
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,440
pull up my little document here

1440
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,880
yeah that's the end of the prepared

1441
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,240
presentations um now

1442
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,559
you have a little bit under an hour left

1443
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,359
in the meeting um

1444
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,640
this is an uh time for

1445
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,440
an open discussion on uh

1446
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,920
the next steps and work uh what's open

1447
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,119
items

1448
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,000
in the working group and how do we

1449
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,960
deal with them and generally frame

1450
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,640
what we're going to do here um

1451
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,400
i would hope that tom's going to help me

1452
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,280
out a lot here by the way

1453
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,839
yes

1454
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,680
i would yeah

1455
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,000
um

1456
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,839
i i actually hope steve was going to

1457
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,038
help us out because he's

1458
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,359
yeah so

1459
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,160
that's actually

1460
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,640
all right let me try so um

1461
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,599
so

1462
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,480
we've been uh negligent in meeting our

1463
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,880
deliverables uh to our uh

1464
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,760
to our stated um

1465
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,319
milestones on the uh the

1466
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,480
description of our working group

1467
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,680
um

1468
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,960
for those of you who have been involved

1469
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,319
with this for a while

1470
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,319
this is not a surprise

1471
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,280
um given the sometimes our change in

1472
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,480
direction and

1473
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,200
um just distractions

1474
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,880
uh but i think at this point we're

1475
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,520
coming up to a question of

1476
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,599
uh along i'm not

1477
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,880
gonna

1478
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,119
i'm just gonna use as an example but not

1479
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,119
it's not the most important thing but

1480
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,640
uh

1481
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,119
this discussion we had about the um uh

1482
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,880
sorry the uh

1483
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,359
rpcr over rdma uh the v the v2 document

1484
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,760
whether it was absolutely required that

1485
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,520
we complete that work at this time

1486
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,119
and

1487
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,000
is is it holding us up um from actually

1488
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,200
delivering

1489
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,359
on implementations and

1490
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,599
making things just work with what we

1491
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,119
have and what we know

1492
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,119
um so we decided basically to put that

1493
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,400
on the shelf

1494
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,480
uh until something would make us

1495
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,200
go back reopen that discussion and

1496
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,640
because there's something critical that

1497
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,720
we need to do in that in our pc over

1498
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,480
already i think that's kind of the

1499
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,160
discussion we had

1500
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,319
so

1501
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,319
i think

1502
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,799
what i'm looking here

1503
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,440
um at the working group is to

1504
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,400
just

1505
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,559
come up with the list of must complete

1506
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,319
items must do

1507
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,280
and

1508
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,079
uh

1509
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,559
define those attach dates to them find

1510
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,480
out identify the ones where

1511
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,520
we're struggling to

1512
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
we're struggling to apply the people

1513
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,119
necessary to

1514
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,960
complete the document

1515
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,039
work pretty much everything in the i tip

1516
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,319
is document work

1517
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,160
uh for the most part that's all i care

1518
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,240
about um but backing the document work

1519
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,000
is sometimes from our side

1520
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,599
implementation work to prove out the

1521
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,440
ideas i don't know that the

1522
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,039
implementation work is what's holding us

1523
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,400
back at this time

1524
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,079
i think what we have is a pile of

1525
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,680
documentation work

1526
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,760
probably the biggest overhang we have is

1527
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,440
likely the completion of the bis

1528
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,559
document

1529
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,799
um that's just a bunch of clarifications

1530
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,880
it's just a lot of work

1531
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,920
so

1532
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,160
um

1533
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,640
i need some help here

1534
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,359
sorry i do need some help here tom

1535
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,559
um

1536
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,799
do we have a list of the

1537
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,240
if you could show the screen of the

1538
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,599
documents that are currently in the

1539
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,640
queue for the working group

1540
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,920
we want to see what's

1541
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,839
so

1542
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,400
yeah go ahead i'm sorry

1543

1547
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,559
happening here and then uh

1548
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,480
then which is basically what you said

1549
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,520
brian i mean like like that's uh

1550
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,079
this working move is like really um

1551
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,039
really

1552
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,319
i mean i have seen like a couple of

1553
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,599
times that people have finding reviewers

1554
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,839
like that for the beast one which seems

1555
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,920
to be when i took took over this working

1556
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,680
group seems to be very important but

1557
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,200
then i failed to see like anybody and

1558
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,960
you have any interest in it and there

1559
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,880
are a couple of documents there uh

1560
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,760
they're out there i have been asking um

1561
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,400
the

1562
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,039
like whoever i i know cares about

1563
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,880
actually like how much it is critical

1564
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,960
for implementation to get it done i

1565
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,158
didn't get a really uh right answer so

1566
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,399
that's that's like this uh this this is

1567
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,238
an i understand this is this is like

1568
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,799
historically like really long

1569
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,399
it has been there this working has been

1570
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,799
there for for quite a long time and

1571
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,640
you you guys are really i see it today

1572
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,719
like you know each other you you work

1573
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,040
together you have done

1574
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,600
tremendous amount of work but now i but

1575
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,158
i see this one actually really declining

1576
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,920
and failed to

1577
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,920
deliver um

1578
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,158
that's that's the one part um another

1579
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,279
part is like

1580
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,040
uh

1581
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,600
when it comes to um

1582
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,679
errata and all this thing i have seen

1583
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,439
like we have like huge amount of ira

1584
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,080
down fs before the i have talked to

1585
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,319
three past eddies like what happened to

1586
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,640
those like why didn't anybody have to

1587
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,120
clear those aorta at least for document

1588
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,719
uh hold up for document update that

1589
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,279
could have been like purified you're

1590
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,359
waiting for something to happen

1591
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,238
that didn't happen so i i also wanted to

1592
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,158
see like how the working group

1593
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,080
actually think and how much that's

1594
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,158
critical because because this is a huge

1595
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,198
amount of

1596
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,839
irata existing the other thing is like

1597
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,679
how we're running the meetings and all

1598
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,000
these things but that i can definitely

1599
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
work with on my chairs

1600
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,799
to make it more workable so let's for

1601
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,319
example like the business document that

1602
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,120
has been like this like

1603
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,120
documented and dev had worked on it it's

1604
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,040
not even in the working group

1605
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,640
documentation list

1606
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,279
so i had to push it for like okay uh

1607
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,600
call for a working goal adaptation it

1608
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,319
got adopted but the record doesn't see

1609
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,080
tell me anything like that so i think

1610
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,000
this all these things is happening like

1611
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,199
whether

1612
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,800
there is the energy in this working

1613
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,640
group to actually carry on the rest of

1614
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,600
the

1615
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,000
make the thing and or what should we do

1616
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,320
that's basically what i want to hear

1617
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,400
from you guys and i'll i'll shut the

1618
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,360

01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,400

01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:24,000
to show a uh

1625
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,120
a screen on beat echo

1626
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,360
i i have the document list

1627
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,000

do you really want to share my screen i

1631
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,760
change my mind um

1632
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,480
jesus christ

1633
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,840
what the hell just happened it looks

1634
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,440
like i'm in an infinite well of

1635
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,719
you did not

1636
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,120
wait wait

1637
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,760
i do it again

1638
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,560
oh okay so yes

1639
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,760
allow okay that isn't very good

1640
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,719
i'm gonna screen snap that

1641
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,199
got it that looks like my entire life

1642
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,880
right now

1643
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,360
did that do it that did it okay

1644
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,600
so um

1645
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,440
i think one of our one of our issues is

1646
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,440
just

1647
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,000
frankly

1648
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,360
let's just be clear here

1649
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,239
our

1650
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,800
a minor issue we have

1651
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,719
is updating this page

1652
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,960
yeah that's not actually the problem but

1653
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,400
it doesn't help that this page is not up

1654
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,360
to date

1655
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,520
um because that just makes people

1656
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,239
confused so there's the documents we

1657
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:54,360
discussed today um up on top uh

1658
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,440
the tls

1659
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,400
the v2 rdma

1660
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,719
open files and uh

1661
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,960
yeah so that's both the ulba and the

1662
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,360
rdma documents which we are going to

1663
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,560
shelve

1664
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,840
until

1665
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,280
something changes

1666
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,679
but it's these bottom documents i think

1667
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,159
that we're

1668
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,840
mostly

1669
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,239
talking about there's a list of internet

1670
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,640
drafts we touched on quick a bit today

1671
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,040
i'm not sure if that is

1672
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,080
um

1673
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,400
let's ignore that the big document here

1674
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,679
is the um the nfs v4

1675
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,440
uh version one minor protocol this

1676
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,360
document i believe is the one

1677
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,199
that is uh

1678
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,920
being reworked uh and addresses the

1679
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,719
erratas i believe is i think is where

1680
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,640
those are appearing

1681
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,679
and

1682
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,960
um i i would just put out that uh dave

1683
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,560
novak needs help and

1684
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,000
i

1685
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,120
would have to

1686
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,600
figure out how to make that work

1687
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,120
mcdavis

1688
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,760
dave owns that document and he's been

1689
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,120
soldiering on a lot on this so what what

1690
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,760
this is richard what's curious to me is

1691
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,000
a if this is a beast document why is it

1692
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,520
still uh as a

1693
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,120
individual document it should uh

1694
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,520
basically go straight straight into the

1695
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,440
adopted into working group

1696
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,679
and the working group can then decide a

1697
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,360
number of editors

1698
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,920
uh so even people that have no technical

1699
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,520
inside knowledge

1700
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,560
and i

1701
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,480
just remember i should keep my mouth

1702
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,280
shut

1703
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,519
um

1704
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,880
i'm just basically working

1705
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,880

1706
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,239

1707
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,799

1708
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,080

i'm not

1715
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,640
dithering about whether to talk about

1716
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,320
this um

1717
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,679
so say

01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,600
that bp yeah i know but i don't know but

1722
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,040
yeah yeah

1723
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,120
television is such fun

1724
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,360
so

1725
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,120
what you're seeing here is a fairly

1726
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,800
small community

1727
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,960
that in the past has managed to generate

1728
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,000
the largest docks the ietf has ever seen

1729
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,320
i got ribbed for iscs he's being 300

1730
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,360
pages and this this group beat me by two

1731
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,679
country minds

1732
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,520
it's like

1733
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,800
yes

1734
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,960
like i said two country miles

1735
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,199
um

1736
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,800
and

1737
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,880
you might be looking at one of the

1738
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,800
things that may be going on here is

1739
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,239
there's definitely enthusiasm for

1740
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,199
smaller docs i mean uh give kristoff and

1741
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,280
i and everybody else interested in the

1742
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,120
green light and and that uh uh scuzzy

1743
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,679
layout update draft uh will be what will

1744
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,199
be in your hands before the end of the

1745
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,040
year

1746
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,040
no problem however

1747
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,679
ask us to go do the maintenance on one

1748
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,400
of the main nfs protocol specs and

1749
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,440
suddenly we have other priorities

1750
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,120
uh i i don't know what to say about this

1751
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,600
aside from the fact that um yeah the

1752
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,239
specs need maintenance um yeah there

1753
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,560
ought to be some uh interesting stuff

1754
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,040
done there but the extent i can i can

1755
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,960
see enthusiasm or speaking myself

1756
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,080
enthusiasm it's for this small stuff

1757
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,840
like the scuzzy layout update that makes

1758
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,239
a big difference

1759
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:33,120
yeah

1760
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,880
so just uh

1761
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,480
just to respond your name is

1762
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,159
why you keep asking me i mean because

1763
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,840
there are people online like you told me

1764
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,120
i had called it i told it before i talk

1765
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,960
maybe i should i should talk loud and

1766
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,159
know my name but yeah

1767
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,760
sorry

1768
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,239
yeah okay

1769
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,880
okay okay you're transported

1770
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,760
so yeah just to respond to that one um

1771
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,320
because even if you were like um

1772
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,920
laughing about it but you made a good

1773
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,000
point right i mean this is this is a

1774
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,159
small working group trying to take it

1775
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,960
like 600 press um the documentation

1776
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,800
update and all this thing and my

1777
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,640
question to this like if this is so

1778
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,120
important why there is no my much

1779
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,600
progress in it so if this is like really

1780
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,320
important thing to do the beast thing um

1781
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,800
do we have the industry ready to

1782
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,640
i mean when this is published they will

1783
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,880
be like updating their servers and

1784
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,440
clowns to to the new version that will

1785
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,000
be updating i don't see that enthusiasm

1786
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,080
i mean into the work i know this is

1787
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,679
important i know this is a maintenance

1788
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,360
is important but

1789
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,840
well uh i don't see any visible

1790
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,000
indication that's the case

1791
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,679
and suddenly you said like we have now a

1792
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,440
smaller document that becomes more

1793
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,840
important maybe those will if we get

1794
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,679
through those those will get have more

1795
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,760
probability getting deployed in the

1796
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,560
in the internet than the the updated uh

1797
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,480
base so i would rather be happy that if

1798
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,920
this working group focuses on the

1799
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,080
smaller document get them done and say

1800
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,080
like well we've done our so far we can

1801
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,120
and then

1802
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,760
rest in peace

1803
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,239
actually i was the author of the last

1804
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,040
this and it took me six years

1805
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,719
to complete the work

1806
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,880
and

1807
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,400
to be very honest i don't know that

1808
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,080
anyone's changed anything

1809
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,840
for that after that

1810
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,440
no i'm agreeing with you but masa

1811
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,600
pointing out it is a lot of work even

1812
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,560
when you're dedicated to it

1813
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,280
so

1814
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,280
i think thorin

1815
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,280
oh

1816
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,679
because every time

1817
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,400
sorry please

1818
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,840
there are a lot of

1819
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,880
work lingering because we were accident

1820
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,040
and we didn't

1821
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,239
finish uh what we started and i think

1822
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,040
that uh needs to be addressed i know

1823
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,280
that we're exigent i know that we aren't

1824
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,120
the perfect thing yet

1825
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,760
there are several

1826
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,080
documents that were not accepted

1827
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,320
including mine for example for data

1828
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,280
reduction as an example but the fact is

1829
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,400
that uh there is work

1830
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:28,000
that can be done and we kind of didn't

1831
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,440
uh attach it

1832
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,040
attack it so

1833
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,280
what i suggest is

1834
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,800
to try to

1835
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,000
get to the point then we are finishing

1836
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,520
the 4-2 so i know that it will take time

1837
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,880
i don't know there's a four-three in the

1838
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,280
future i don't think so maybe there is

1839
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,880
maybe there isn't there are new

1840
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,239
technologies

1841
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,960
in the network in the memories and all

1842
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,600
this that could justify but at this

1843
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,520
point in time we have to finish what we

1844
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,080
started and i would be very sad to see

1845
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,719
this group closed because i think we

1846
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,400
have something important that i can tell

1847
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,280
you that my current company were using

1848
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,480
some of the the nvme stuff so you know

1849
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,880
it's it's that's why i want to be sure

1850
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,480
that all understand

1851
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,640
that we don't want to close this group

1852
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,480
or maybe i'm the only one i don't know

1853
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,600
so anyways that was my my point

1854
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,280
okay so

1855
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,280
okay uh thank you siren uh this is brian

1856
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,280
plowsky co-chair of the nfs version for

1857
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,480
working group

1858
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,239
so um i i

1859
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,040
agree with you when you said i think

1860
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,600
that this very much summarizes

1861
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,360
i think where we are finish what we

1862
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,840
started that that absolutely

1863
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,920
should be our friggin tagline and we

1864
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,679
should have t-shirts made

1865
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,520
um because that's i think what we're

1866
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,600
discussing um

1867
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,719
i

1868
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,480
no one is proposing shutting down the

1869
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,400
working group and dropping stuff on the

1870
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
floor and watching it bounce

1871
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,480
that's not it the discussion is what are

1872
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,800
the things we need to focus on

1873
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,560
what are the priorities

1874
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,120
and what are the resources necessary to

1875
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,760
complete it before i am would you say

1876
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,880
r.i.p yeah before i am r.i.p and very

1877
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,199
very quiet and six feet underground

1878
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,400
so um

1879
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,639
i think that's that's just where we are

1880
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,360
um and and i think part of that goes to

1881
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,639
i'm

1882
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,199
extraordinarily reluctant to

1883
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,239
for proposals of let's do new work

1884
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,280
of any substantial size

1885
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,560
um

1886
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,960
like a let's redo the entire nfs version

1887
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,840
4 protocol that would i

1888
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,520
i could imagine somebody proposing it

1889
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,960
and i would be saying that no that's

1890
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,639
just not where we are

1891
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,280
okay so the small documents are

1892
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,199
i would call not the diminished amount

1893
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,199
of work or thinking but the nvme

1894
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,679
document highly leverages the previous

1895
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,080
work done for pnfs and the layouts where

1896
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,000
a lot of thinking went into it

1897
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,159
and we're not revisiting that thinking

1898
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,360
we're just

1899
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,719
reflecting

1900
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,280
where the industry is in the

1901
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,920
this is the third decade of 20 sec 21st

1902
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,800
century i think is that over here

1903
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,120
2022. so so i think that that level of

1904
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,639
work that

1905
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,159
i think the best document just needs

1906
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,239
i think the best document needs just to

1907
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,040
finish what we started completion i'm

1908
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,120
afraid to drop

1909
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,679
david help me sorry can i interrupt you

1910
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,239
kristoff for a second david can someone

1911
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,280
give me the

1912
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,719
strict definition of a missed document

1913
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,400
the strict i was just trying to find i

1914
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,280
really want to know the strict

1915
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,760
definition of this document

1916
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,960
strict definition yeah uh folklore it

1917
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,719
evolved as a as a convenient way to tell

1918
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,719
someone who's reading the document what

1919
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,360
it replaces

1920
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,320
that's it

1921
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:56,360
oh wait so that can't be it no no no no

1922
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,920
because it's not it's not it's not it's

1923
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,520
not on the level discussion of let's

1924
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,360
manifest manifest

1925
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,159
version for edifice before

1926
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,239
version two or

1927
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,560
anything like that it's not a minor

1928
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,719
revision or anything like that of the

1929
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,719
nfsp4 document it is revision of the

1930
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,080
specification

1931
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,760
right and and and

1932
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,560
uh let's see

1933
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,480
okay well

1934
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,719
i'm trying to stare at the screen where

1935
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,400
the font's too small

1936
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,840
and as i said

1937
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,239
this head the what does this mean i said

1938
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,440
it

1939
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,840
it really is folklore it it became a

1940
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,880
convenient way to tell some to tell the

1941
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,440
reader that it's a example this draft is

1942
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,840
intended to replace rfc 5661

1943
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,199
and that that's it

1944
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,920
would have a question is there a

1945
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,960
requirement to do a best document ever

1946
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,000
no no no

1947
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,360
so so i wanted to to this is richard you

1948
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,400
just kind of wanna yes

1949
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,440
i just

1950
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,040
i just wanted to make

1951
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,719
some some comments around are you both

1952
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,239
austrian by the way yes okay just

1953
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,559
checking

1954
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
having had some experience with uh being

1955
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,560
an editor for this document and i can

1956
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,480
fully agree with with david here a biz

1957
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,080
document is really just an convenient

1958
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,199
way to

1959
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,280
say something that this document will

1960
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,840
become the new standard instead of an

1961
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,000
old standard it has no meaning appearing

1962
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,360
whatsoever of the

1963
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,719
technical contents that are being

1964
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,960
changed or if it is just an update

1965
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,400
because of errata

1966
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,679
that's uh that has no bearing to one

1967
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,159
um other than this it

1968
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,320
a this document that is really just an

1969
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,000
update for errata for editorial things

1970
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,159
can become a very very lengthy work

1971
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,320
speaking of experience

1972
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,440
to very

1973
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,560
minor gain

1974
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,159
so

1975
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:03,040
i've been updating the 1323 document

1976
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:07,040
to 73 23. nobody actually refers to 20

1977
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,880
73 23

1978
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,480
by the document name itself because

1979
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
everybody knows the old document

1980
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,320
however if you would nowadays implement

1981
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,320
the old document specs you would

1982
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,199
basically not be compatible with tcp

1983
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,360
stacks all over the world or you would

1984
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,400
have actual bugs in your implementation

1985
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,480
so

1986
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,040
a biz document that addresses technical

1987
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,600
and and editorial errata is

1988
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,960
an important

1989
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,320
aspect

1990
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,639
but it's a kind of an

1991
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,719
unloved child kind of thing

1992
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,080
a lot of work for very little gain

1993
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,360
so from a

1994
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,800
point by making

1995
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
um from a priority perspective if this

1996
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,040
piece document is the kind that i've

1997
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,199
referring to with errata

1998
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,520
technical and editorial

1999
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,560
then

2000
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,320
i would think the priority to do this

2001
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,480
and to complete this should be lower

2002
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,120
than the other documents

2003
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,960
if as you mentioned or as you alluded

2004
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,719
earlier that this document here is

2005
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,719
really a revamp of the entire document

2006
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,960
in a major way

2007
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,280
then i cannot i cannot comment on the

2008
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,040
relative priorities to this

2009
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,000
thanks

2010
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,120
okay

2011
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,120
thank you uh wait is there anybody i'm

2012
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,880
sorry i gotta bother everybody in a

2013
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,239
second

2014
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,760
nobody okay uh

2015
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,639
sorry kristoff yeah so someone who's a

2016
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,360
relative newcomer to the group and and

2017
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,159
and comes from more of a storage focus i

2018
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:31,920
think i mean one of the big problem with

2019
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,360
the group is

2020
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,840
i mean nfs 4.0

2021
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,560
now originally was a mess that that

2022
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,920
basically wasn't helpful nfs401 fixed it

2023
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,920
then the group spent a lot of effort on

2024
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,320
doing the best document for nfs4 that no

2025
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,400
one really cared about

2026
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,120
and uh now we're trying to do the same

2027
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,320
for 4.1 and if it was just catching up

2028
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,080
with the errata it would be very simple

2029
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,760
document but i think the problem is it's

2030
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,159
trying to bring over the

2031
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,159
internationalization rewrite from the

2032
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,480
four biz document which

2033
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,239
in theory is very important in practice

2034
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,760
doesn't matter what the implementations

2035
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,199
do anyway

2036
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,679
so uh

2037
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:12,880
yeah

2038
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,199
i'm not sure that's a good priority for

2039
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,280
the group

2040
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,199
so um yeah i mean i i'd like to

2041
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,199
understand the priority here i mean the

2042
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,880
definition of priority i mean prediction

2043
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,600
of priorities like what documents we

2044
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,400
should take on first and complete or

2045
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,239
priority based on like what is needed

2046
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,239
to get things um

2047
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,800
secure and get things interoperable and

2048
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,960
get things going so i i'd like to

2049
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,199
understand that part as well because i

2050
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:55,920
mean

2051
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,239
the um what i'm hearing like this this

2052
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,480
document is important and it is

2053
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,239
addressing lots of error time but nobody

2054
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,199
cares

2055
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:04,400
that doesn't tell me

2056
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,480
that like this this should get like a

2057
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,199
lot of attention right now it could just

2058
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,840
be there and we can have like very low

2059
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,520
updates and all this thing but at the

2060
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,679
same time if this is this is this

2061
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,199
somebody tells me like

2062
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,679
i cannot really run this nfsv nfsv4

2063
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,679
one version um

2064
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,000
because i don't i have all this error i

2065
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,560
have um like hundred and

2066
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,480
some some hundred plus

2067
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,880
and if i implemented that then it's like

2068
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
it's not going to work and that's this

2069
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,639
is really important

2070
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,280
that so i please please mention like

2071
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,880
what is your priority

2072
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
and try to try to understand like what's

2073
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
the implication we have if nobody cares

2074
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,120
about this document

2075
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,920
well i can ask why we started this one

2076
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,360
um

2077
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,360
or something else what was the history

2078
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,719
i'd like to know that as well

2079
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,960
uh like

2080
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,480
sorry uh there's one person in front of

2081
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,400
you and then i'll get to you hold on

2082
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,600
but i want to make a comment um

2083
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,719
this is why i was asking about the

2084
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,920
definition of this i

2085
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,040
thought that the best document started

2086
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,159
from addressing errata

2087
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,000
and unclear portions of the

2088
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,520
specification

2089
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,679
that's what i believe was how i stopped

2090
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,159
how we started it when when we did when

2091
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,840
we did new

2092
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,239
like when we went from 4.0 to 4.1 it

2093
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,880
wasn't a bisque document it was new it

2094
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,159
was like an area

2095
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:32,880
right

2096
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,480
it was it was a new version protocol

2097
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,360
because

2098
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,199
because you bumped the minor number i've

2099
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,800
also been involved in verb well i

2100
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,120
wouldn't say involved at the same credit

2101
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,639
in a working group that i run

2102
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,320
unfortunately other people did most of

2103
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,719
the work uh we just turned out a best

2104
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,159
document for sctp and that was a rather

2105
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,480
large doc i'm sure it's not uh as a head

2106
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,199
start saw it go by and it was

2107
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:59,199
it was not not all errata but it was all

2108
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,280
minor stuff that needed to be fixed that

2109
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,120
the implementers agreed this is this is

2110
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,679
this is how this is how it ought to work

2111
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:06,639
um

2112
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,360
so i i guess what i would recommend to

2113
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,520
us ahead is to

2114
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,199
structure

2115
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:17,120
his thinking as an ad around two types

2116
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,120
of docs we got this we got these

2117
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,120
relatively small stuff in which there is

2118
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,880
strong interest

2119
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
and then we've got this abyss and the

2120
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,960
maintenance of the old stuff and the

2121
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,280
errata and which is what seems to be

2122
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,480
causing him loss of sleep and those two

2123
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,320
things ought to be thought about

2124
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,679
separately and figuring out what happens

2125
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:36,480
here

2126
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,040
okay um and and i i need thank you uh

2127
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,440
david black dot soren are you still

2128
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,440
there are you with us yep

2129
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,719
yep please

2130
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:45,760
go

2131
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,440
okay so uh look i am going to go back to

2132
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,719
uh some changes that the industry uh

2133
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,440
went through that will require

2134
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,840
attention that i'm focusing on my draft

2135
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,400
for data reduction because that's the

2136
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,800
place i live in today and this is the

2137
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,199
clouds so

2138
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:08,000
all the the the clouds the one that are

2139
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,880
relevant uh uh amazon aws uh

2140
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,239
google gcp and uh

2141
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,040
microsoft azure they all are talking

2142
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,400
about uh data reduction because that's

2143
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,239
an important part

2144
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,960
of moving to the cloud so i think from

2145
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,719
that perspective

2146
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,199
this is a new

2147
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,600
work that should be done in this group

2148
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,360
because

2149
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,239
you know the clouds are moving faster

2150
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,120
and we are staying behind if we don't

2151
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,679
keep up with that again i advocate for

2152
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,120
my

2153
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,040
draft as an example but

2154
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,440
that should be one of the directions

2155
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,840
that should happen today because it is

2156
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,360
what's happening in the industry it's

2157
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,840
not me it's you know i work in a company

2158
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,080
that does data migration to the cloud

2159
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,120
and i can observe all these facts so

2160
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,840
that's my point

2161
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,880
uh

2162
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,560
okay

2163
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,560
i want to say thank you

2164
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,800
um

2165
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,760
your transparency again again

2166
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,560
so

2167
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,800
uh david i i think you made a good point

2168
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,360
right i mean we have a couple of a

2169
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,199
couple of issues here and i say like i

2170
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,440
started with three like uh i mean the

2171
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,520
question is like i can i can i can ask

2172
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,120
the question about the process and all

2173
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,120
this thing and uh

2174
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,600
previously made decisions like why this

2175
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,600
is that and this is that like you have

2176
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,679
like 100 plus uh unverified errata that

2177
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,080
you started to fix it without any kind

2178
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,960
of like

2179
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,719
um like um resolution on this like even

2180
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,639
if it's not not like verified hold it

2181
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,280
for documents like nobody did anything

2182
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,960
uh it has been there for quite a long

2183
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,840
and then basically now if i look and

2184
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,400
into this whole thing the piece i kind

2185
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,920
of understand like these are these are

2186
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,719
two

2187
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,639
this this this is supposed to take care

2188
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:05,360
of irritates which are not really

2189
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,800
um

2190
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,080
we didn't agree on how to solve them now

2191
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,480
this when this piece is happening we i

2192
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,639
expect that discussion to happen that's

2193
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,159
not even happening

2194
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,480
it's like dave is trying pushing his

2195
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,639
work he's trying to get reviews there

2196
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,600
were a couple of the ietf meetings and

2197
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,679
incrementing there was no review so i i

2198
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,360
kind of felt like this is not like the

2199
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
thing that the working group should

2200
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,120
focus on and then it comes to the

2201
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,320
smaller documents i would appreciate and

2202
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,639
the authors of this smaller document to

2203
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,239
get these things

2204
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,239
to some sort of a state where like i

2205
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,960
mean i think uh today we we said like we

2206
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,480
will we're getting getting this um nvme

2207
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,040
document uh as a working group and then

2208
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,960
dave you said like yeah i'll get

2209
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,800
something really soon and there are a

2210
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,719
couple of documents that

2211
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,440
we discussed today is very it's really

2212
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
like tom said it's almost done now it's

2213
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,080
just working with last call so do those

2214
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,960
things

2215
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,639
go for those things and see like where

2216
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:05,920
it ends up

2217
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,280
because uh because i'm i don't i see i

2218

01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,440
is a management issue how we are running

2225
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,520
things we can talk about that one if it

2226

01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,360
asking and today i'm exactly i'm feeling

2230
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,040
it better like we're talking about it we

2231

2233
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,040

2237
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,360

david black is going to say something

2239
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,280
yeah david blackman is going to say

2240
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,800
something

2241
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,639
so there's a lot of nfs out there

2242
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,800
there's a lot of running code

2243
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,360
a lot of it is

2244
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,000
not exactly close to the latest docs

2245
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,560
this working group has produced to put

2246
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,840
it politely

2247
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,960
and unfortunately i got a plus one uh

2248
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,560
christoph snide remark about

2249
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,320
internationalization

2250
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,199
that uh that that that has that has a

2251
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,040
particularly that has a particularly

2252
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,719
sorry sorry his sorry history nfs uh

2253
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:21,520
that

2254
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,120
i don't care to go over further without

2255
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,800
adult beverages

2256
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,880
uh it had a sorry history before the itf

2257
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,840
right and that

2258
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,480
by ignoring it completely

2259
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:35,840
somehow

2260
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,679
most of the running codes seem to do

2261
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,080
something useful most of the time

2262
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,600
as long as you do it in english

2263
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,639
no it actually it it it it it actually

2264
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,560
it was it was actually actually beyond

2265
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,760
there but yeah but

2266
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,239
free work never mind that right with

2267
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,760
utsa by the way

2268
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,760
um

2269
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,239
sorry never mind that's a rat hole okay

2270
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,480
that's a rat hole because case case case

2271
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,800
sensitivity case sensitive and unicode

2272
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
is a rat hole all by itself which we

2273
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,360
don't need to explore i mean for example

2274
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,000
what is what

2275
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,880
what's y what what what's the upper case

2276
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:23,520
version of of an ascii lowercase i

2277
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,360
answer it depends on what locale you're

2278
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,360
in unicode doesn't have a single answer

2279
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,759
nevermind

2280
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,480
didn't we used to have a rubber rat in

2281
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,080
the meetings didn't we used to hold up a

2282
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,400
wrap

2283
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,239
go ahead

2284
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,400
so

2285
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,639
i think the structure here is figure out

2286
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,239
how to take some of this how to take

2287
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:53,119
some of the smaller drafts forward

2288
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,679
and then look at the sort of maintenance

2289
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,520
of the big docks and the and of the the

2290
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,199
bigger drafts as sort of sort of a

2291
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,679
separate matter and if you

2292
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:05,280
tease those two apart at least has a

2293
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,960
structure uh to start grappling with uh

2294
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,520
with what what what is what is useful

2295
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,159
work here and then figure out what is

2296
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,400
what is necessary on the big ones given

2297
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,520
this given the small size of the

2298
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,600
community

2299
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,199
yes and and

2300
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,600
yes and and so let's just for everybody

2301
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,760
on the online just a reminder dave novak

2302
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,360
who is doing most of the work on this

2303
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,840
document is not here and i had a slide

2304
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,920
early on which i said i didn't want to

2305
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,920
talk about this document without dave

2306
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,280
not being here

2307
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,199
because we're going to be talking about

2308
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,719
stuff without

2309
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:39,760
the background to complete the

2310
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,960
discussion

2311
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,760
so

2312
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,600
um and dave did tell me he's not going

2313
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,080
to be able to give us an assessment of

2314
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,159
that until a month out

2315
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,800
okay so um i believe that was

2316
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,400
you know we had a brief talk before we

2317
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,560
talked so um

2318
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,199
i got it i got it i think we decided

2319
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,480
today to

2320
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,800
shelve two documents that are on this

2321
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,600
list

2322
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,600
related to the already already maywork

2323
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,400
uh the v2 stuff and then move forward

2324
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,280
with the nvme dock these are and people

2325
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,159
have put their hands up to work on it

2326
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,159
um and

2327
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:15,040
tom

2328
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,159
haynes on the state id document

2329
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,960
is moving forward so i think we made

2330
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,480
some decisions on the small documents

2331
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,519
then we just gotta

2332
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,800
put them in the milestone list

2333
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,560
i believe is what one thing we have to

2334
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,520
do

2335
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,360
clean what's been the milestone that

2336
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,199
doesn't need to be there anymore

2337
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,480
and then

2338
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,840
um get

2339
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,719
dave novak to come in and

2340
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,639
give us a

2341
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:43,840
do not do

2342
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,760
on the this document

2343
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,159
and assess the what's critical and

2344
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:50,960
what's not is that and we're separating

2345
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,920
out the

2346
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,600
decisions made on the smaller documents

2347
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,639
today

2348
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,119
from the larger pile of abyss document i

2349
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:58,880
don't think there's

2350
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,800
anything else and i brian plowsky i'm

2351
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,560
not asking for new work right now

2352
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,560
um except when kristoff proposes new

2353
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,159
work kristoff

2354
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,159
uh not proposing new work but i think

2355
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,239
one of the big items our

2356
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,600
ad gave us was errata handling and i

2357
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,239
mean i think one of the problems is we

2358
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,520
have a lot of

2359
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,199
old big documents that aren't

2360
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,800
particularly relevant that have a lot of

2361
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,040
errata and a lot of people that worked

2362
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,040
on them are not actively part of the

2363
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,679
working group rit

2364
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,719
and

2365
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:34,719
so so what are we going to do about it

2366
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:35,760
who's

2367
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,679
someone needs to spend time on it i mean

2368
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,520
i could volunteer some of my time but

2369
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,920
especially for the older stuff like 4.0

2370
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,400
i'm not sure i'm even qualified well the

2371
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,600
thing i was going to point out is the

2372
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,600
4.0 stuff might have been taken care of

2373
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,880
with the abyss

2374
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,560
because at the time i was taking the

2375
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,199
errata as they arose and was fixing them

2376
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,520
straight away in the abyss document

2377
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,199
but i might not have been communicating

2378
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,600
that to the chair so that they knew that

2379
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,440
they were being taken care of well but

2380
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,840
that's supposed to be done in the in the

2381
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,760
errata tracker right so maybe you just

2382
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,000
need to walk through them and mark them

2383
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,920
as verified fixed in the biz document or

2384
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,520
something

2385
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,679
okay can i so christoph i'm gonna i'm

2386
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,040
gonna summarize that and tom's gonna put

2387
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,159
a note take a note tom um that uh we

2388
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:21,600
just gotta scrub the errata list and um

2389
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,960
and just

2390
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,040
really scrub it so that people aren't

2391
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,880
getting nervous

2392
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,440
and then determine to me determine

2393
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,280
two things

2394
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,199
one which errada we don't care about

2395
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:38,000
anymore you know what nobody's using it

2396
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,600
we're not going to update documents that

2397
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,760
no one even cares about and let's mark

2398
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,119
and just i assume there's a way to close

2399
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,560
those errata out

2400
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,800
um and then

2401
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,000
my thinking was that the this document

2402
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,880
that dave owns has been primarily

2403
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,520
um working on the existing errata for

2404
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,000
what people are interested in using

2405
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
um which a lot of what i thought we

2406
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,360
discussed in the past by the way was

2407
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,440
just clarifications of the specification

2408
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,600
describing what we actually meant when

2409
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,360
we said something i thought there was a

2410
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,960
big pile of those and maybe dave's

2411
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,920
gotten through muslim but i i let's let

2412
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,760
me again follow up with dave he's not

2413
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,560
here

2414
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,159
okay there's three people at the

2415
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,520
microphone is there anybody online that

2416
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,040
wants to join this

2417
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,360
conversation no not yet okay i love it

2418
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,440
when i go so i don't believe this

2419
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,360
richard again just uh one one minor

2420
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,960
point that you that i've not hear you

2421
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,280
say and that is adopting of uh this

2422
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,280
document as a work as a full

2423
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,199
featured working group document so that

2424
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:36,400
the worker group has a formal uh change

2425
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,400
control over the document and not the

2426
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,600
author

2427
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,040

2430
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:46,800
document

2431
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,719

you want to say something about it but

2437
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,080
but

2438
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,520
again

2439
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,119
uh so yeah

2440
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,760
the irata if you what what do you just

2441
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,679
say um and

2442
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,320
and i see one volunteer uh to actually

2443
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,639
look go through that one

2444
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,800
that would be great then we know exactly

2445
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,159
what you're doing

2446
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,040
uh

2447
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,440
what what have already been taken care

2448
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,440
of and what are the different things and

2449
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,360
and i have a clear idea like this is

2450
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,000
like something that that i can reflect

2451
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,239
to when i'm looking through to the

2452
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:33,679
documents and all this thing that would

2453
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,840
be a great thing to do so if you could

2454
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,920
do that that's that's that's great

2455
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,440
thanks for doing this

2456
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,920
um and for the practicality yes this

2457
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,400
joke will need to be in the item i don't

2458
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,320
know like if i have i have already

2459
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,719
mentioned a couple of times like this

2460
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,199
and there should be a adoption call

2461
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,040
i think there was adaptation adoption

2462
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,280
call for this document in the

2463
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,280
in the working group or

2464
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,480
i'm sorry

2465
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,159
so the biz document is now is the

2466
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:03,199
individual document and

2467
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,320
yeah

2468
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,480
we have we have asked for the adoption

2469
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,719
call for that beast right i don't know

2470
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,480
like please check that one i think we

2471
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,480
have done that just it's just updating

2472
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,960
the data tracker then okay i got i got

2473
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,639
it um i think chuck's going to say

2474
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,800
something that's going to remind us of

2475
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,520
something that dave's working on

2476
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,880
um chuck leaver i think chuck lever

2477
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,639
oracle

2478
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:29,119
one of the reasons why this is still a

2479
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:30,880
personal draft and not a working group

2480
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,679
document is because part of this

2481
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,119
part of the mission of doing this

2482
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:36,239
business

2483
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,760
um uh

2484
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,840
to recognize that this is an enormous

2485
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,280
ass piece of work that needs to be split

2486
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,400
so dave had proposed um i think

2487
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,760
splitting it four ways into four

2488
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,280
different documents

2489
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,800
so i'm not sure

2490
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,440
about process here but i don't know if

2491
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,520
we want to adopt that

2492
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,600
particular document as a working group

2493
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,920
document or if we want to see the split

2494
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,760
documents adopted

2495
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,639
right and i yeah and i'm sorry that's

2496
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,880
and that was discussed a very long time

2497
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,159
ago yes it was and agreed to by the

2498
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,360
working group

2499
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,840
um primarily because

2500
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,560
uh frankly um

2501
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,159
anything that's done outside of this

2502
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,159
working group in terms of

2503
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,960
editor reviews and everything else that

2504
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,560
the size of the document is daunting it

2505
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,320
was felt that if it was

2506
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,560
broken apart with no changes to the

2507
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,280
protocol itself and that that just the

2508
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,960
act of breaking

2509
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,600
the document into four pieces um

2510
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,080
focusing on specific areas which i

2511
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,600
correct me from wrong truck but like one

2512
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,600
of them one of the four documents would

2513
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,920
be specifically a security document

2514
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,000
which allows outside review of the

2515
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,560
security portions of the protocol

2516
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,880
which aren't necessarily in one location

2517
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,880
on the document today so it was going to

2518
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,400
be like pull pull pull focus focus focus

2519
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,639
would allow for the faster final reviews

2520
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,639
of the best document once it emerged

2521
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,159
because it was four parts and respective

2522
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,239
area expertise can be brought to the

2523
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,320
document they were interested in without

2524
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,679
having to wade through the

2525
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:14,159
523 pages they didn't care about

2526
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:15,679
so

2527
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:17,440
okay

2528
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,639
sorry

2529
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:19,600
and

2530
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,320
like we don't see uh on this uh window

2531
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,760
in front of us

2532
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,239
the documents that have expired since

2533
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,400
january i think at least three of them

2534
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,159
security is not up here because it's

2535
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,679
expired

2536
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:34,960
so it's hard for us to track the uh

2537
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,199
versions of the documents that were the

2538
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:40,400
progeny of 5661 bis

2539
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,040
i don't think dave ever intended 5661

2540
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,560
bis to be adopted as a working group

2541
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,159
document he just meant it as the base

2542
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:48,960
for doing the split

2543
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,920
okay

2544
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,560
so just to be clear i'm not objecting to

2545
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,040
to this work becoming working group

2546
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,119
uh working group documents but i think

2547
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:58,800
that there's some history here that we

2548
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,480
need to identify you're being very

2549
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,360
specific about what we choose to adopt

2550
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,560
exactly

2551
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,560
okay

2552
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,600
okay

2553
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,960
so again

2554
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,960
without dave here

2555
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,639
um

2556
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,080
i don't wanna

2557
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,480
i don't wanna

2558
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,719
say things that i can't speak to um but

2559
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,880
i have the list of questions and the

2560
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,480
concern and the asks around

2561
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,639
and

2562
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,800
priorities for the group i think uh

2563
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,639
general discussion here in terms of

2564
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,679
documents okay but i i need a lot more

2565
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,880
information from dave and i needed yeah

2566
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,600
and

2567
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,960
the other day yeah david black yes and

2568
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,880
yeah dave's going to have a cow when he

2569
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,480
uh

2570
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,080
understands what we did in his absence i

2571
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,000
mean and there's there's even bigger

2572
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,440
question on the table which is

2573
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,159
is the split worth doing

2574
01:45:56,159 --> 01:46:00,080
versus stabilizing what we got

2575
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,600
you know talking about cows um

2576
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,920
this is brian pulaski chair the

2577
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,159
version four yeah yeah yeah no no the

2578
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,760
cows always come when we submit the

2579
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:14,880
document for a review and then everybody

2580
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,440
everybody complains to us that they

2581
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,639
didn't want

2582
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,480
the meal supersized they wanted the

2583
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,080
regular burger right

2584
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,480
and and so i mean david you know we've

2585
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,639
been freaking yelled at by i know we're

2586
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,480
gonna yell about it basically

2587
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,519
repeatedly what i'm basically asking is

2588
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,320
is it sufficiently important i gotta i

2589
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,119
gotta

2590
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,239
to generate an across-the-board

2591
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,360
update

2592
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,280
that would as a baseline result in the

2593
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,199
enormous document that would then have

2594
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,360
to be split to get it through i get it

2595
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,360
get it through get it to get it through

2596
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,760
is that whole program of work worth the

2597
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,119
outcome so

2598
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,400
i will say

2599
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,560
sorry david s very good question is that

2600
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,719
whole idea worth the outcome i would say

2601
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:01,600
when we

2602
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,080
discuss the split and i cannot remember

2603
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,679
how long ago but this was not in the

2604
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:07,360
past three months this was in the past

2605
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,800
three years

2606
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,400
we discussed this split i don't think

2607
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,760
anybody thought we'd be having this

2608
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,440
discussion today

2609
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,920
i thought i think we thought

2610
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,080
that the split would be completed by now

2611
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,080
and things would be going along smoothly

2612
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,440
and also would have allowed other people

2613
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,639
within the working group to take the

2614
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,000
areas they're interested in to review

2615
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,800
right

2616
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,480
because we wouldn't be having a

2617
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,880
discussion of you know a bunch of people

2618
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,000
trying to find the area they need to

2619
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,440
worry about so

2620
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,599
i do are you did you scan in

2621
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,760
okay but yeah but if you scan in the

2622
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,840
name they might not disband us though

2623
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,080
um

2624
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,520
thank you

2625
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,800
um

2626
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,280
okay uh is there

2627
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,480
any

2628
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,040
okay i i think i have tom's been taking

2629
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,159
notes i hope

2630
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,880
uh i think uh david black rewrote all of

2631
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,250
my notes i think that was him typing um

2632
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,960
[Laughter]

2633
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,560
and uh which is kind of funny um but uh

2634
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,280
i

2635
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,719
think i have a lot of follow-up week

2636
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:10,960
taking some actions

2637
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,440
um

2638
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,280
when the minutes get published we'll

2639
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,840
communicate the actions we took on the

2640
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,440
documents today

2641
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,480
i will talk to priorities on the working

2642
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,840
group list

2643
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,639
and

2644
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:29,199
um and i'm buying into david's

2645
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:32,719
model of let's consider two piles

2646
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,719
one of the smaller docks that people

2647
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:37,199
have gravitated towards to drive to

2648
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,480
completion

2649
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,480
that we discussed today and then the

2650
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,840
best document

2651
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,280
to

2652
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,920
step back for a second and find out uh

2653
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,880
and have that discussion on um

2654
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,719
where are we

2655
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,480
what's its purpose

2656
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,119
and um

2657
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,719
since nobody's

2658
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,239
yeah let's just leave it at that okay

2659
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,960
but i again i do need dave novak in that

2660
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,320
discussion okay um and then at the

2661
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,960
there uh

2662
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,199
uh yeah so

2663
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:11,280
so yeah i think i think this has been

2664
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,080
very fruitful discussion so far um we

2665
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:14,960
have

2666
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,800
at least an idea like what we are

2667
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,320
supposed to do we have some action

2668
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,760
points i would love to have you or or

2669
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,000
the secretary actually write write an

2670
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,920
email to the mailing list for the record

2671
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,280
like this is what

2672
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,040
we have discussed this is what we have

2673
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,800
action point so that we can follow up on

2674
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,760
this

2675
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,920
thing and for this this document split

2676
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,159
or not displayed i i don't mind actually

2677
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:38,639
we talk about it again and try to make a

2678
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,480
good decision so that's up to the

2679
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,800
authors and the working group to decide

2680
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,760
um my personal opinion is like we we

2681
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,280
talk about whenever we have a business

2682
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,440
document is obsoleting that's a

2683
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,199
different case but if it's updating and

2684
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:53,920
stuff like that the isg usually asks for

2685
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,840
like whatever be clear what you are

2686
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,199
updating and all these things so the

2687
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:59,599
structure of document really matters for

2688
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:01,760
that case um but that's a that's the

2689
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,159
later case but let's discuss on this

2690
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:07,280
when dave is back okay um

2691
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,360
about the split and then do the right

2692
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,840
thing um

2693
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,760
like split or not split i don't care

2694
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,480
just add up the documents and carry on

2695
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,080
the work and the background

2696
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,280
um and please keep the data updated yeah

2697
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,159
and and i know and sanitize the the list

2698
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,840
get the drive to get the drafts up where

2699
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,440
they need to be and working group drafts

2700
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,679
and update the milestones and

2701
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,560
scrub that a bit just so that people

2702
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,840
looking from the outside are a little

2703
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,000
bit a little bit clearer what we're on

2704
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,760
yeah exactly because everybody knows

2705
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,760
this we are having this discussion today

2706
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,599
so that would be good to get them like

2707
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,840
the what exactly we are we discuss and

2708
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,080
decide and that's why asking for and

2709
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,080
written uh something record in the

2710
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,360
mailing list

2711
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,400
thank you okay thank you

2712
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:55,280
um is there anything

2713
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,639
any tom talpy

2714
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,480
i just have a random question is the

2715
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:04,159
charter still current

2716
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,880
um well i don't want to throw work on

2717
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,080
the pile but

2718
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,280
it seems like

2719
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,960
especially if we're going to promote new

2720
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,760
documents i'm guilty of not updating a

2721
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,760
document that's uh chartered for

2722
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,040
instance

2723
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,040
should i

2724
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,960
let me look at the charter before we

2725
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,560
start updating documents that are

2726
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,280
referenced there yeah

2727
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,239
okay

2728
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,800
please no that's i i i was looking at

2729
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,320
the milestones and i was going okay

2730
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,119
that's not up to date and then uh

2731
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,400
but i also want to go through the

2732
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,679
charter

2733
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,360
i remember when we wrote that the words

2734
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,639
for the charter

2735
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:42,880
we left it pretty wide open

2736
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,119
i mean yeah it's pretty broad yeah

2737
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,400
well

2738
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,719
we were being coached to not paint

2739
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:51,440
ourselves into a corner but also not to

2740
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,000
so but make sure that we're it reflects

2741
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,679
some of the things we talked about today

2742
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,440
okay

2743
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,639
right

2744
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:01,040
okay if splitting our work into a large

2745
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,960
and small documents sounds like the

2746
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,239
charter might be impacted slightly

2747
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:10,080
thanks okay i'll take a look thank you

2748
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,560
i'm going to say going

2749
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,360
well i'm going to say two things um

2750
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,719
this is the first time we've gotten

2751
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,080
together

2752
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,560
since before covet is that face-to-face

2753
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,840
we've gotten ahead of interims and

2754
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,360
everything virtual

2755
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,000
um from thank you tom so much for making

2756
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,119
this a lot smoother than i would have

2757
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:30,480
been with only me here

2758
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,360
um

2759
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,760
and uh no it's uh it's been a lot more

2760
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,199
it's been a much higher bandwidth

2761
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:36,480
discussion

2762
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,639
