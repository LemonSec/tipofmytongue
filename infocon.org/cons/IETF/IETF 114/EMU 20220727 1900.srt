[Music]

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
all right i think we'll get started

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
so uh this is uh email working group at

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,759
uh ietf 114

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
you have probably all seen this note

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,119
well quite a few times this week but

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
it's up here again so you can refresh

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,119
your memory

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,200
there's a couple things to go over one

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
is people in in

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
in the room should be logged in through

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,480
the

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
on-site app so that the attendance is

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
taken

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
and so they can join the queue

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,320
okay

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,079
so please log in through that app there

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
are some barcodes around

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
or you can go to the agenda and click on

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,750
it

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,680
[Music]

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
other things is in the room please uh

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,079
wear a mask except when speaking at the

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,640
microphone

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,518
okay

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,799
uh so we have a a pretty full agenda

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,240
but i think we should have time to get

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,439
through all of it and maybe have a

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,960
little time for some discussion at the

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,920
end

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,880
um

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
one thing i would like to do is is

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
recognize that uh

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,840
mo hit uh stepping down as chair due to

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,759
additional responsibilities from his

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
professional

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
job

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,439
so

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,960
i want to thank mohit for all the work

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
he's done over the past couple years and

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
being a great co-chair

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
but now we also have uh peter stepping

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,960
up

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
as a co-chair i want to thank him too

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
for taking on

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,279
that responsibility

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
all right um does anybody have any

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
modifications they'd like to make to the

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
agenda

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
all right so i think we'll get started

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,800
with um

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
uh tls based uh eve type so alan are you

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
do you want me to share this slides or

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
do you want to run the slides from your

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
um no go go ahead or let me just go

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
ahead show the slides

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
um

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
yeah so not a lot up from last time go

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
to the next slide

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
um

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,959
so we seem to be good to go the document

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,879
is okay

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
um i haven't heard of any

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
implementation issues

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
other than

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
implementation choices

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so i don't want to name names and

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
embarrass people too much but one

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
implementation has decided to not

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,159
support new session ticket for ttls and

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
peep and presumably everything else

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
um and the configuration for that does

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
not always work and i i've seen

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
questions about this

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
that's apparently on their agenda to get

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,599
fixed

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
but it's one of these you know decisions

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
above other people's pay grades

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
the downside for supporting new session

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
tickets or not supporting them

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
is you have to do a full round of

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
authentication every time

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
someone re-authenticates

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
um this will cause significant

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,280
loads on back-end databases

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
um especially in university settings

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
where

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
every hour you have you know 20 000

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,680
people closing your laptops

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,519
walking across the hallway

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
and opening your laptops again

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,200
however if you can get these things

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
working the protocols do work they

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
inter-operate

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
everything else seems to be good to go

96
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,760
and there's multiple client and server

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
implementations

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
so that really is it we had a bunch of

99
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,918
reviews from various people

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
all of those have been addressed in the

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
latest revision of the document

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
there might be a couple minor typos but

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
i think we're pretty much done it at

104
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,639
this point

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,600
and

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,560
that's hopefully finished and

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
perhaps ready for a last call

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
i think that's it i think there was only

109
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
one slide

110
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
yeah i think so

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,479
thanks um

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,919
does anybody have uh

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
know of any open issues in this dock

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
i think it's probably something that we

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,720
can move forward

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
i don't know that we need to do another

117
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
working group uh

118
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,039
class call on it because i don't think

119
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,440
that changes with that but we'll go back

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
and check and prefer amongst the chairs

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
and then

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
figure out what what the next step is

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
but i think we're we're pretty much

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
good to go with this one i think we're

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
about ready to put it through though

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
all right

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
all right

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,280
thanks

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,799
i think uh now uh yard

130
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,630
[Music]

131
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,360
okay so this is an update on this

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
uh

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,039
forward secrecy draft

134
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,639
your version has been posted next slide

135
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,960
so um draft status has been

136
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,319
fairly uh

137
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
ready uh in my opinion for some time uh

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,639
module one discussing about encoding of

139
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,240
the graphic values we'll talk about that

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
in slide four

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
um and um i guess the authors at least

142
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
believe that there's an opportunity to

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
deploy this

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
and gain significant security

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
improvements particularly against some

146
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
pervasive surveillance activities if you

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
get some of the keys uh then um

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,199
that that's really bad but this this uh

149
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
this specification can help there to

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
some extent at least

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
uh for the newest person john torrent is

152
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,319
one of the co-authors in the draft

153
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,520
and uh

154
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
we improved the draft in in in a number

155
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
of ways

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
like three and then we went through

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
uh on our side at least uh the

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,880
background with regards to the uh

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
current source of encoding and that that

160
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,599
was is indeed on slide four

161
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,880
and um

162
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
my wish is to start working with last

163
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
wall now we're ready for that i think

164
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
um almost regardless of you know what

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
what a discussion there might be unless

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,599
there's something drastic that we

167
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
haven't heard of before

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
next slide

169
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
so the

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
other changes uh or other topics beyond

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,800
this encoding issue

172
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,440
we attempted to further improve the

173
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
explanation of what does this actually

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
provide in terms of uh

175
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
security benefits um

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,120
we attempt to also say that this is

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
that's important to migrate the existing

178
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
systems to use the forward secrecy

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
method and

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
we make a recommendation to do this

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
migration

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,960
um we changed the warning a little bit

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
with regards to

184
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
how we refer to

185
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
issues within the smart parts so we used

186
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
to say

187
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
there could be issues with smart cards

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
but but it's rather not just the smart

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
cards or maybe not even with the

190
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
smartphones at all but rather the supply

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
chain how you manufacture them and how

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,919
you supply the keys forward and so forth

193
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,800
so

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,879
i'm trying to be

195
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
accurate there

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
and

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
we discuss a little bit about the chosen

198
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
algorithms

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,758
next slide

200
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
so um in in the last couple of ideas

201
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,440
we've had some discussion about the

202
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
public value

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
encoding and so

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
we went through the discussion um we

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
looked at the references we looked at

206
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
some other systems

207
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
and some open source cryptographic

208
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,639
library implementations

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
the text by itself in the draft hasn't

210
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
changed so the text is in this box on

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
the on the right hand side

212
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,200
we

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,519
did check the language

214
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,600
in our specification

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
in contrast to what is being said in the

216
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
various references

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
we think it's exactly right

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
um of course we could miss something but

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,200
uh hopefully you'll tell us

220
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
we'll also observe that this exactly

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
same arrangement

222
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,519
the same lengths and so on is used by

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,320
the

224
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
3gb uh 5t specifications for another

225
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
purpose where they use

226
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,399
this

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
publicly this particular public key

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
technology

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,279
and

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,080
given this background

231
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
we'd like to keep the context and move

232
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
forward so this is sort of aligned to

233
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
what is anyway done in the phones

234
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
and that was a strong reason for us to

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
keep keeping it as as it is

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
there are other alternatives and they

237
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
might even be both for some benefits but

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
also perhaps some downsides so so for

239
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
instance we could allow both compressed

240
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
and uncompressed uh forms which is

241
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,959
allowed by sec-2

242
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,880
but that would of course introduce you

243
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
know maybe additional negotiation or

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
issues with like you have to support

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
both and so forth so

246
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
maybe not actually worth it

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
and um

248
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
yeah so i guess the the main question

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
here if anybody objects and i know john

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
do you want to add anything does that

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
miss anything

252
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
someone says no

253
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
okay so that's what i intend to say now

254
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,279
please uh if you have objections or

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
other observations or you know whatever

256
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
comments please come to the mind

257
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,959
and if there are no comments or

258
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,480
objections then maybe

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
maybe we actually are done and you guys

260
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,519
can

261
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
start the last goal and then we

262
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
hopefully get some additional reviews

263
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
and maybe discover some further issues i

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,040
think that's the next step

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
yeah i think we'll we'll start the

266
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
worker blast call soon

267
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,000
thank you

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,760
edpp is

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,319
okay thanks my name is dan harkins

270
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
so uh this is a document that owen and i

271
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
have been working on and send its

272
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
revision next slide please

273
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
so to remind everyone uh this is

274
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
intended to solve the onboarding catch

275
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
22 which is that you need a credential

276
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
to get on the network but you need to

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
get on the network to get a credential

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,519
so how you solve that uh has been

279
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,800
pretty much well

280
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
well solved for wi-fi with the dpp

281
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
protocols what we want to do is we reuse

282
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,639
the dpv bootstrapping mechanism and the

283
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,880
ecc key pair format

284
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
that it proposed

285
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
and

286
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,240
use that to onboard

287
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,680
devices on the wired networks

288
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,279
we're going to we want to use hkdf to

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
drive a pre-shared key from this

290
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
bootstrap key which is actually a public

291
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
key

292
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,519
uh then due to serve based off with

293
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,040
external psk

294
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,480
uh addition to tls and do a raw public

295
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
key authentication for the client side

296
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
uh using the bootstrap and key

297
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,200
the nice thing about this is that we're

298
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
not proposing any

299
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
extensions or changes which we have been

300
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,680
doing in previous versions

301
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,479
next slide please

302
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
so the big change from draft photograph

303
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
5 was

304
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
we had been using

305
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
a draft from the tls working group

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
extensible psks but that doesn't really

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
look like it's going anywhere and we

308
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
didn't want to uh

309
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,800
pitch our wagon to uh something that's

310
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
not not really moving

311
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
and we were told that uh the best way to

312
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
do this was to use the tls uh external

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,720
psk importer

314
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,440
uh

315
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
draft which is trying to canonicalize uh

316
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
when you import a psk much in the same

317
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
way that there's exporters

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,040
that you can take secrets out of the

319
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
tls context secrets in

320
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
so uh

321
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
basically we used we used

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
that specification to define how we can

323
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
take this bootstrapping key uh we use

324
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,399
hkdf to produce the epsk and the psk id

325
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
and then we construct the imported

326
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
identity

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,880
per this

328
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,399
spec

329
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,279
to use this uh epsk and epsk id

330
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,959
and uh import it into the

331
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
tlst schedule

332
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,359
next slide please

333
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,120
so this is how tls would look like

334
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
using uh

335
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,079
dpp

336
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
dpv bootstrapping keys so the

337
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
uh the text that's not bold faced is

338
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
just your typical plain jane

339
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,000
uh

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
tls exchange and the stuff that says

341
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,240
boldface is present if you're doing

342
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
dpp bootstrap

343
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,880
so what's going on is the the client's

344
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
saying uh we want to do

345
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,519
uh authentication using the service kind

346
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,360
of a serp we're going to add an external

347
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
psk

348
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
uh the clients will authenticate with a

349
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
raw public key

350
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
and then you define what the pre-shared

351
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
key is using again this uh this

352
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
importers construct

353
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
the server responds in kind and then

354
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
they just do the finished messages

355
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
they're good to go

356
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
so again the only real change we did

357
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,959
between three and four was uh where the

358
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
arrows show the pre-share key being

359
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,639
added this is now using

360
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,920
the external psk and quarter proposal

361
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,479
next slide please

362
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,519
so then

363
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
how this fits into into emu is the

364
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
proposal is to is to use this to

365
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,440
authenticate

366
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
so uh the the device will uh basically

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
plug into a switch we'll get a deep

368
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
identity request and he responds by

369
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,399
saying

370
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
tls proof of

371
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
proof of knowledge

372
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
in which case the server knows that he's

373
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
going to be doing this dpp

374
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
authentication

375
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
and then

376
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,199
tls will be authenticated using ppp

377
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,480
bootstrapping

378
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,199
uh once teep has been authenticated it

379
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
can proceed to the normal pkcs107

380
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
exchange that's already part of teep and

381
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,320
now the

382
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
the client has a certificate and his

383
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
subsequent connection will be using that

384
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,360
provision certificate

385
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
next slide please

386
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,639
so as i said this is the fifth version

387
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
of this draft we do have some running

388
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
code that owen wrote i'm

389
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
i'm working on trying to get this to

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
work with uh

391
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,079
open ssl there's a new 7250

392
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,920
uh pr for

393
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,279
openssl that i'm going to try and take

394
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
advantage of once that gets

395
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,199
released but we don't have we only have

396
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,120
one implementation with this so far

397
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
uh we have gotten uh some good reviews

398
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
from the tls working group uh

399
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,279
again earlier proposals for this

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
uh

401
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,800
required new tls extensions and required

402
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,279
changes to the tls key schedule which

403
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
made everybody nervous so when we

404
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,839
presented this at uh ietf 110 we got

405
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,079
some very good advice from uh people at

406
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
the tls working group to use 8773 and

407
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
7250 instead

408
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
which was a great recommendation so we

409
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
did that uh and then we got some more um

410
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
uh

411
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
some more review in 111 and then finally

412
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,600
uh

413
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
in vienna we were told that we should

414
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
probably not use the

415
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
uh we should probably use the psk

416
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
importers and not the old field method

417
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,440
of

418
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
uh of naming psks

419
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,720
so

420
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,199
i think we've got uh a very good amount

421
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
of review uh again this doesn't require

422
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
any changes to tls there's no no new

423
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,640
extensions

424
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
uh there's no change to the key schedule

425
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
this is all using existing uh

426
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
rfcs and uh a soon to be rfc it's still

427
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
draft but uh

428
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,839
uh existing proposals that have gotten

429
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,640
uh

430
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
you know good good vetting

431
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,360
so uh

432
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
again the only thing that changed was

433
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
we're using this external importer so

434
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
i'm thinking that this draft is pretty

435
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
stable and i'm hoping that we can get a

436
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,720
uh

437
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
consensus call

438
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
out of this meeting

439
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
okay

440
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
does anybody have any uh questions uh or

441
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,559
comments relating to this draft

442
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,240
thinking about the client identity

443
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
protection can you confirm that the psk

444
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,840
is only used

445
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
once

446
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
is that the case

447
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
yes yeah once once it gets on board it

448
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
now has a certificate and then

449
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
the bootstrapping key is never used

450
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,080
it would be good if you added some

451
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
sentence about

452
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
that because that's a problem with tls

453
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
psk that you don't

454
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
if you reuse the psk you don't get any

455
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
identity protection

456
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
i will add that

457
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
thank you

458
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,360
hi um when you say it's never used again

459
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
i assume

460
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
i assume you mean unless the device is

461
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
reset and needs to be repaired to a

462
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
network again or is this literally once

463
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
ever

464
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
oh unless it goes like

465
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
reset the factory defaults then i guess

466
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
it could probably conceivably use its

467
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,120
bootstrapping key again but

468
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
uh

469
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
if this is basically just a one one time

470
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
get me on the network

471
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
okay i just thought i asked in case i

472
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,799
had any implications

473
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
okay thank you

474
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
um yeah i just wanted

475
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
pointing out what uh jonathan hamill

476
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,480
already did that rfc

477
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,840
9258 is the external psk importer it's

478
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
published

479
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
oh

480
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
excellent so

481
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
relative to your rough consensus i'd say

482
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,679
pretty much sorry about my echo

483
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
great thank you very much for that

484
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
information

485
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,799
okay

486
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,960
so yeah so that means that we're just

487
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,280
using

488
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,600
standard rfcs that have been vetted

489
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,799
pretty

490
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,960
solidly so

491
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
i'm not doing any any weirdness

492
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
and i i think this also fits into the

493
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,039
charter we have a charter item for uh

494
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,799
bootstrapping uh

495
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,320
keying material

496
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
or credentials um so

497
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
i think yeah we should start the

498
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
adoption call and

499
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
you know after this idea

500
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,039
okay

501
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,200
thank you

502
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,240
all right

503
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
now we have uh

504
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,080
ad hoc

505
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,039
how do you want to run the slide

506
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,280
if you can i appreciate thank you

507
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
so

508
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
this is a the next version of this

509
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,158
proposal for if ad hoc

510
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
we

511
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
a couple of

512
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
co-authors joined

513
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
this new version goran sander and

514
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,720
john matson who are

515
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
a co-author of

516
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
advocate as well

517
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,000
and

518
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
in this new version we have performed a

519
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
full review of the document addressing

520
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,880
i think all of the concerns that were

521
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,039
posted in the mailing list

522
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,480
so uh

523
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,919
next

524
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,919
we can proceed to

525
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
to see a

526
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
the summary of everything that

527
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
a highlight of the most important

528
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,120
aspects this new version has has

529
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,320
addressed

530
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,760
so we can start

531
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
in the next slide with a bit of a

532
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,559
refresh

533
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,400
a recap

534
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,440
so basically this

535
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,360
method proposes the use of ad hoc which

536
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,200
stands for fmldf helmand over cosi uh

537
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
pro edward provides a very compact and

538
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
lightweight authenticated difficult

539
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,960
monkey exchange with fml keys

540
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,679
provides mutual authentication for

541
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,400
secrecy and identity protection

542
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
and what's one of the

543
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,440
most interesting things i've er about at

544
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,320
hawk i think it's that it's a

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,799
it's very suitable for constrained

546
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
scenarios so

547
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
uh having any methods using a

548
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
ad hoc would provide a very

549
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,480
constrained and

550
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,200
many a minimum if method that could be

551
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
used in constrained scenarios in here we

552
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
can

553
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,640
see one of the main changes

554
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,880
we highlighted in this version is the

555
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,760
use of privacy friendly

556
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
request

557
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,120
response identity sorry

558
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
and we can see that

559
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
the main

560
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
exchange

561
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,360
would

562
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
take care of

563
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,280
about six messages so

564
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,678
it would be these messages that are

565
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,639
also very

566
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
expected to be

567
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
constrained not very long

568
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
and

569
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,799
after the hockey exchange we would just

570
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,400
provide

571
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,039
the success indication if everything

572
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,440
goes okay so the next slide please

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
this is one of the

574
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,630
main

575
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,360
[Music]

576
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,640
highlights in this version which is the

577
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,600
use of the privacy friendly response

578
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,480
identity so we have added a requirement

579
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,440
to avoid a permanent identifiers in

580
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
clear text in the

581
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
in the response

582
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
identity

583
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,159
and we added

584
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,200
using a ni recommendation

585
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,720
to omit your surnames or similar and

586
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
here we can see some examples we could

587
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
just use

588
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
a real or anonymous

589
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
realm or unencrypted identity

590
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,840
so this way we would be

591
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,400
compliant with a privacy friendly

592
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
response identity

593
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,760
next slide please

594
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,639
so another

595
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,799
issue that we address is the

596
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
fragmentation support

597
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
to do that we

598
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,240
actually

599
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
use a very similar

600
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,039
method as the one

601
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
used in each tls which is

602
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,440
adding a

603
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
flags some flags

604
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
to

605
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,000
steer the fragmentation

606
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,559
[Music]

607
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,640
either from the

608
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
the

609
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,480
request or the response

610
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,279
part

611
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,720
okay and basically the workings are

612
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,840
exactly the same as ftls so i think

613
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,679
there should be no issues uh on how

614
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,159
fragmentation is is managed in this case

615
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,400
as well

616
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
next slide please

617
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
another issue that we are addressing

618
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
here is a

619
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
using a

620
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
an alternative

621
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
indication in ether

622
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,400
actually what we are using is uh the

623
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,039
message for which is already present in

624
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,400
ad hoc

625
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,039
uh although in ad hoc

626
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,240
is

627
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,360
optional

628
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
for e-network we are

629
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,159
stating that it should be

630
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,440
mandatory to use to be compliant with

631
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
the alternative success indication

632
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,520
and

633
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,039
the next slide please

634
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
and basically we also added a

635
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
different

636
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,960
error use cases okay for

637
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
uh when the error is generating

638
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,120
generated on

639
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,880
each of the messages from ad hoc

640
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,799
so the idea is that

641
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,600
anytime a message is not processed

642
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,720
correctly it would be followed by

643
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
an advocate error message which contains

644
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
the following information

645
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and we will be signaling the the error

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,200
to

647
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,400
one of the other parties okay

648
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
next slide please

649
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,679
so

650
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,120
basically

651
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
in this version

652
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
i think we address

653
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,600
all the issues that were raised in the

654
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,840
mailing list

655
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
we would appreciate

656
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
any review from from the working group

657
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
we do not expect

658
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
any more

659
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
a lot of changes or major changes

660
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
because ad hoc is already

661
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,960
we think a very mature draft okay and we

662
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,120
would like to raise the question to the

663
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,159
working group is that this work is ready

664
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,120
for for adoption would be adopted for by

665
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,640
the working group

666
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,840
and that would be it thank you very much

667
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
the questions

668
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,360
um i i'd like to get a

669
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,799
a measurement of how many folks in the

670
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,279
in the chat and in the room have have

671
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
read this trap so you could raise your

672
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,919
hand or indicate in the chat if you

673
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
read the strap

674
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,520
anybody in the room one

675
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,600
hey gorham do you have a comment

676
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,840
or you just

677
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,559
well i'm a co-author so i obviously i've

678
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
read the draft

679
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,039
can recommend it

680
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,120
all right i think

681
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,880
we'll want to see a little more uh

682
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
review and perhaps discussion on the on

683
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,000
the list of this uh draft i think we'll

684
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
also have to evaluate it's not clear to

685
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,440
me if it's within the charter

686
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
as it stands which isn't necessarily a

687
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
problem but

688
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,760
uh

689
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
we might have to amend the charter to to

690
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
take something like this on

691
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,799
but if if we have support for it you

692
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,600
know

693
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,840
so i think the appropriate thing to do

694
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
here would be to have some discussion on

695
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,919
the list make sure that we have interest

696
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,799
um and then we will discuss kind of an

697
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,399
adoption and

698
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,000
maybe work with with paul to see if uh

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
if it's appropriate to also amend the

700
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
charter

701
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,559
okay thank you very much

702
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
okay now we have

703
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,840
onboarding

704
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,600
okay i'll

705
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
i'll talk for this too

706
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
um so

707
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,840
we presented this michael i presented

708
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
this in anima on monday

709
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
there was a

710
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,720
resounding um

711
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
so

712
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,880
um

713
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
the question for this partly is whether

714
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,760
this is applicable to anima or here

715
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,000
there is some overlap so for the next

716
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
slide

717
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
um

718
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,200
what we're trying to do here is solve a

719
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
brewski onboarding problem

720
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,200
so

721
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
we have an unconfigured device it needs

722
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,760
to be onboarded has no credentials

723
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,640
would like to use unauthenticated tls

724
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,520
and join a captive portal network

725
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
while 5216

726
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,159
allows for unauthenticated epls it

727
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,679
offers no additional help

728
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,399
and so effectively this has been

729
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,440
entirely unused and unusable

730
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,120
so the proposal here is to add explicit

731
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
signaling via an

732
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,679
um eep.rpra

733
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,720
this can't be forwarded or proxied

734
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
um it's a signal from the client device

735
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,600
that

736
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,240
i want a captive portal

737
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
once it's on the network

738
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,519
it has a full network full ipv6 v4 or

739
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,720
whatever

740
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,840
um

741
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
and this avoids trying to stuff brewski

742
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,080
into eep

743
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
and reuses existing captive portal

744
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,399
infrastructures

745
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,840
um next slide

746
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,399
so the device can still authenticate the

747
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,120
server the subject alt name

748
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,600
if the ca route is good enough for web

749
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
surfing that's good enough for this um

750
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,039
the behavior of the local network is

751
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,240
really a bit to be defined

752
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
uh we can also use

753
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
to signal other things

754
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,039
there's similar work being done

755
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,320
elsewhere the wi-fi alliance has defined

756
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,559
their own vendor-specific

757
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,080
tls type

758
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,279
which does unauthenticated epls

759
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,440
this is part of the wi-fi alliance

760
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,559
hotspot 2.0 captive portals

761
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,440
so

762
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,720
something vaguely resembling this is

763
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,360
widely deployed

764
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,080
not defined in the uh in the ietf

765
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,760
defined in an sdo controlled by the sdo

766
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,440
and unusable by anyone outside the sto

767
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,919
so this pulls some of that back into

768
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,480
the ietf and lets

769
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,880
people other than when sdo use it

770
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
i think that's it next slide is just

771
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,519
questions

772
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,440
related work yes

773
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,799
similar work is being done elsewhere

774
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,240
and then

775
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
the next slide is just uh questions

776
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
i'm done

777
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,360
you're saying this this is based on

778
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,440
things from the wi-fi alliance does it

779
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,679
mean that there's any ipr concerns with

780
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
this

781
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
uh sorry it's not based on

782
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,440
the wi-fi alliance but the wi-fi

783
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
alliance has previously done something

784
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,640
similar i mean dan may have comments

785
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,519
i don't know

786
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
related comment to enters or something

787
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
else

788
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,760
something else

789
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,880
okay um yeah i i don't know what ipr the

790
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,399
wi-fi alliance has on this given that

791
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,080
5216 defines unauthenticated tls

792
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
and we're just using this

793
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,120
um i would hope that there isn't much

794
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,840
and hotspot 2.0 has all kinds of other

795
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
stuff that we're not doing here but i'll

796
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,720
i'll go take a look

797
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,840
can you go back a slide oh jesus

798
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,720
uh

799
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,679
maybe one more that one there we go yeah

800
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,880
so

801
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,799
that's kind of a bold statement that is

802
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,480
ca root is good enough for web browsing

803
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
that's good enough for onboarding uh you

804
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,440
know

805
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,880
cas are supposed to do some due

806
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,840
diligence before they give out

807
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,639
cert and that due diligence that they do

808
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
for

809
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,560
serving up a web page you know that

810
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,960
you're a legitimate

811
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
entity to serve up a web page is not

812
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,359
really quite the same

813
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,800
as the due diligence that it should be

814
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
doing

815
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
to show that you're

816
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,800
the legitimate owner of or you know

817
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
service provider of a

818
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,960
particular network

819
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,320
i know that

820
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,000
a lot of times a client just doesn't

821
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
care

822
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
and uh

823
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,320
while cas do give out

824
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,599
search for web browsing they don't

825
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,760
really give out certs for onboarding so

826
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
there's a

827
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,520
desire to

828
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,879
you know

829
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,560
just do it but uh i think you should

830
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,960
it's kind of

831
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,879
it's comment bait right if you make a

832
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
statement like that in the draft i think

833
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
you're just going to get

834
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,640
crapped all over so i think you you know

835
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,319
if if you want to use the

836
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,520
reuse slash misuse assert you should

837
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,280
probably come up with a better reason

838
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
than just

839
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
that

840
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,119
sure

841
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,359
um those are all good points

842
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,720
um

843
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,440
so part of the reason for saying this

844
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,400
is

845
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
um

846
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
there is an additional bootstrapping

847
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
problem of

848
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,880
if i'm going to connect to an

849
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
unauthenticated network

850
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,960
um

851
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
it would be nice to be able to

852
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,000
authenticate it right

853
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,359
and other

854
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,200
in in the absence of an existing ca

855
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,480
um

856
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
you really have no way of onboarding

857
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,280
yourself and trusting that network

858
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,000
without just simply trusting anyone

859
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,960
that seems to be rather a lot worse than

860
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,599
leveraging an existing ca

861
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,920
framework

862
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,960
that being said

863
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
cas do not issue certificates for

864
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,280
onboarding

865
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,359
they also don't issue certificates for

866
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,240
eep

867
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,599
and there's been

868
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
shall i say some discussion about this

869
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,040
topic

870
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,160
um

871
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,280
the as best i can tell

872
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
the uh

873
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
ca forum

874
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,320
only allows cas to issue certificates

875
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,720
for use with

876
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,280
https um that information is

877
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,400
buried all over the place um so arguably

878
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
using those certificates for email or

879
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,119
eep or anything else is a violation and

880
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,720
you know should cause the certificate to

881
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,440
be revoked and even perhaps the

882
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
um

883
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,920
ca's authority to be revoked so i my

884
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
sort of

885
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,359
polite pushback not really security

886
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,760
pushback but polite pushback is if we're

887
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,480
just reusing these cas everywhere for

888
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,920
everything

889
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,280
um i don't personally see it as an issue

890
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
here and if it's

891
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,359
forbidden here it would be good to

892
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,640
understand

893
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,280
why it's not forbidden or it is for eat

894
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,680
for email for everything else

895
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
but that that's a bit of a larger

896
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
discussion outside of this

897
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
so

898
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,960
for the purposes of this document

899
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
it would be good to be able to

900
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,079
authenticate the network you're

901
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,520
connecting to

902
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,960
even if you don't authenticate yourself

903
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
and that's sort of the

904
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,280
smallest phrasing i can have that small

905
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,240
set of requirements i guess

906
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,240
bernhard

907
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,800
hi alan

908
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
um

909
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,200
just had a question about the eep.arpa

910
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,839
um

911
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
i i

912
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
i'm a little bit uncomfortable with that

913
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,599
because

914
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,520
you know if you you could use instead

915
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,079
a username with the domain that you're

916
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,320
looking to get to i mean are you saying

917
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,200
that

918
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
you basically have no idea what you're

919
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
connecting to

920
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,720
so that you can't relate uh you don't

921
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,359
have an expectation about whatever

922
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,200
domain is

923
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,480
um so the eep.rpa here is the signal

924
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,680
from the client trying to connect that

925
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,640
it wants a captive portal network

926
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
if you use

927
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,240
a normal domain

928
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,119
and

929
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,800
um

930
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
try to connect there then what the

931
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,839
server sees is hey

932
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,599
user is trying to authenticate but

933
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,930
they've provided no

934
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,160
[Music]

935
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,440
client certificate with etls

936
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,560
they might

937
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
be intending this to

938
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,880
work in a captive portal

939
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
um

940
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,200
but

941
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,320
that there's no explicit statement of

942
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
hey i want a captive portal

943
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
and i have no identity because i just

944
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
got bootstrapped and i have no idea

945
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,200
what's going on right brewski is all

946
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,720
internet of things

947
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,240
um so the

948
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,200
at 8. arpa is i have no idea who i am

949
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,880
i want a captive portal and enough ip

950
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
connectivity to do a whole bunch of

951
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
other stuff

952
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,880
okay so you don't even you don't even

953
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,560
know who you're trying to connect to to

954
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
get to get credentialed

955
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,599
okay yeah this is this is all brewski

956
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,880
and there's huge amounts of stuff behind

957
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,400
the scenes to bootstrap iot things

958
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,839
which raises another question uh if you

959
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,440
don't know who you're connecting to then

960
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,520
uh are you gonna sort of round robin

961
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,400
through

962
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,040
every single access point that you

963
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,160
see from your scan

964
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,079
um

965
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,560
your brewski is successful

966
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,359
uh perhaps right this is this is really

967
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,480
an issue

968
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,200
independent of this for brewski

969
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,640
um

970
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,880
eight or 80211u

971
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,319
does say that the uh

972
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,680
systems will

973
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,319
will broadcast the domains they can

974
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,839
authenticate for

975
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,400
um so if only one broadcasts eep.rpa

976
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
presumably that's the one you connect to

977
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,560
and if multiple do

978
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,079
yeah you don't really have a lot of

979
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
choice even in normal brewski to do

980
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,760
anything other than sort of round robin

981
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,560
hendrick

982
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
yeah maybe i can add something brewski

983
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,880
has some own built-in mechanisms

984
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
to um

985
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,480
sorry my camera is

986
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
so to

987
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
um to authenticate the network you are

988
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
connecting to so

989
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,359
the mother voucher communication

990
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
provides the device

991
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,599
some means of

992
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,440
knowing whether it is supposed to

993
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,280
authenticate to a specific network so i

994
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,200
i guess michael

995
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,040
aims for using the epls just as a as a

996
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,880
transport mechanism

997
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,240
and the

998
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,880
the provisional except of the unoff just

999
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,280
servo authenticated tls

1000
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,119
to later on um verify that the device is

1001
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,200
really onboarding to the

1002
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,440
network it's um

1003
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,760
its manufacturer

1004
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
asks him to

1005
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,480
yes

1006
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
so the the proposal here is this is

1007
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,599
simply a way to get

1008
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
internet connectivity

1009
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,599
um whatever happens after that is

1010
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,839
elsewhere defined elsewhere once you

1011
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,240
have full internet connectivity

1012
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,640
um you can do whatever you want to

1013
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,240
authenticate yourself to authenticate

1014
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,839
the other side

1015
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,400
part of the pushback here for me

1016
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,640
is um there's a lot of proposals to do

1017
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,280
basically everything over eep you know

1018
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,440
if the only

1019
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,000
connection you have between the client

1020
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,200
and anything network is beat based

1021
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
there's a certain incentive just to

1022
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,079
throw provisioning on boarding pkcs7

1023
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,160
everything into eep

1024
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,599
and as an implementer among other things

1025
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,760
that only seems wrong it's complicated

1026
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,680
it's fragile

1027
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,440
the error paths back to the end user are

1028
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,079
almost non-existent

1029
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,720
it's much much better to use eep just

1030
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,440
for eep and then you have full ip

1031
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,960
connectivity and you can do whatever you

1032
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,839
want

1033
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,280
question

1034
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,400
yeah

1035
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,240
so um

1036
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
yeah trying to think about this like

1037
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,680
what's acceptable here what the

1038
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
requirements actually are

1039
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,720
and

1040
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,119
authenticating the server with the web

1041
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,760
ca roots yeah maybe

1042
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,119
but what i was actually wondering about

1043
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,400
is that you see

1044
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,079
an ssid let's say

1045
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,440
a ssid example and then you connect it

1046
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
and you think you want to do this so you

1047
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
send a special

1048
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,359
identifier

1049
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,400
and you talk to a a server and server

1050
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,839
gives you

1051
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,520
yeah blog.com or whatever

1052
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,599
and so is there some need to sort of

1053
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,760
correlate the two that

1054
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,400
both the server and

1055
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
the client think that they are sort of

1056
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,280
connecting with the same network or

1057
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,640
well if there's some reason why that's

1058
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,800
not needed or it's not possible or

1059
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
i i um

1060
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,240
it would be good to have some some kind

1061
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,800
of channel bindings um that's defined

1062
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,760
for

1063
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
other eat methods but not for not for

1064
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,000
eat tls

1065
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,640
but yeah that is a good point

1066
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,599
and

1067
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,000
in terms of web pki

1068
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,319
this is what people do today for eep

1069
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,760
right

1070
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
you

1071
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,640
get a certificate for

1072
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,359
radius.example.com

1073
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,319
from a well-known ca and you drop it on

1074
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,599
your eap radius server and you just use

1075
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,640
it

1076
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,560
and depending on who you talk to this is

1077
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,400
either perfectly fine

1078
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,720
or it will destroy the world

1079
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,319
there doesn't seem to be a lot of in

1080
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,800
between unfortunately

1081
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,880
so it it sounds like uh we have

1082
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,280
you know some questions here raised kind

1083
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,520
of on this

1084
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
how you identify the network um and

1085
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,800
whether that's important or not for for

1086
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,640
this use case and

1087
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,079
i think this would be

1088
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,720
an important thing to kind of uh

1089
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
resolve or or

1090
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,440
at least

1091
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
um

1092
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,040
expand upon

1093
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
uh if this is moving forward

1094
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,760
um do you what is your intention here

1095
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,839
are you guys publishing a draft or

1096
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,400
yeah we published a draft shortly before

1097
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,440
the uh cut off um the current draft is

1098
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
basically a line in the sand of about

1099
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,480
four paragraphs uh let's do this

1100
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,520
um

1101
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,800
we will flush it out and then um

1102
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
address all these concerns

1103
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,800
uh to the best of our abilities um and

1104
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,040
the question is this a lot of this is

1105
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,680
really done before the brewski work so

1106
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,319
whether this is done in anima or e

1107
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
um i suspect because it

1108
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,560
really

1109
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,800
what what we're proposing here really

1110
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,960
only involves changes to e

1111
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,280
and any brewski

1112
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
work is

1113
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,119
a second step once you have full ip

1114
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,720
connectivity you just run all the

1115
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,240
brewski protocols and they don't even

1116
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,440
care

1117
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,599
um how you

1118
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,200
how you got connected

1119
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,000
so emu would likely be

1120
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,160
the the best choice for this

1121
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,400
but the the draft as it stands is really

1122
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,119
there to support brewski

1123
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,800
yeah so one more comment uh

1124
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
wouldn't brewski take care of the

1125
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,000
you know you're on the you're on the

1126
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,400
wrong network problem i mean if if you

1127
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,599
go to if you associate to this

1128
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,040
network you get on the captive portal

1129
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,359
and you send a voucher the master is

1130
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,040
going to go oh the

1131
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,560
voucher came through

1132
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,319
you know

1133
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,480
foo dot com and foo is not where you're

1134
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
supposed to be so i'm going to

1135
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,680
refuse this

1136
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,200
voucher request

1137
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,480
so it

1138
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,880
since since brewski should solve that

1139
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,119
problem it would seem to me that

1140
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,880
your draft could probably even be

1141
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,640
simpler just don't even worry about

1142
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,119
authenticating the tls connection for

1143
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,839
captive portal just to a completely

1144
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,560
anonymous authenticated exchange and

1145
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,119
all you want is ip connectivity for the

1146
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,599
for the client and brewski should secure

1147
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,079
the rest of it for you right yes

1148
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,599
okay any if there are no other questions

1149
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
i think you know this

1150
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,280
we should

1151
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
uh keep an eye on this i since you are

1152
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,040
reusing eeptls in in maybe a slightly

1153
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,880
different way here i think it would be

1154
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
important for us that this moves forward

1155
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
to kind of understand

1156
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,079
uh

1157
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,319
if if that has any effects on other

1158
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,680
usages aside from this one

1159
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,440
but seems relatively straightforward

1160
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,079
but i don't know that i have any opinion

1161
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,280
on which

1162
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,200
group it should be done necessarily

1163
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,839
and i think with that

1164
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,880
we are

1165
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,440
through our regularly scheduled agenda

1166
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,800
do i leave anything off

1167
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,760
the

1168
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,400
other topic i i had here

1169
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,720
was just to kind of discuss

1170
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,599
um

1171
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,839
you know

1172
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,839
is are there things

1173
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,640
that uh we're getting through most of

1174
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,920
our uh

1175
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,000
chartered items

1176
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
um and as we see there are a couple of

1177
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,680
new ones coming up for example ad hoc

1178
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,280
perhaps this onboarding uh use case

1179
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,559
um

1180
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,559
that you know are i think are not quite

1181
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,720
covered by the current charter

1182
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,400
we've also had some discussion in the

1183
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,480
past on on

1184
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,920
eep

1185
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,440
uh as as in general if we wanted to to

1186
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,400
look at

1187
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,480
the

1188
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,880
making any sort of changes there which

1189
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,960
seems rather

1190
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,240
you know that's something that has been

1191
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,920
brought up um

1192
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,559
so i'd like to understand if and and i

1193
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,880
think also some folks have

1194
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,160
brought uh

1195
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,000
some things on how to improve the

1196
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,720
experience of eap

1197
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,240
uh getting associated with networks etc

1198
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,479
um

1199
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,319
i think we're going to have to make a

1200
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,920
decision over the next uh

1201
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,000
uh you know

1202
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,319
probably by the next ietf on what what

1203
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,040
sort of things are we are we looking to

1204
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,079
uh bring into the group um so i

1205
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,520
want to understand if people have any

1206
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
thoughts on that now

1207
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,119
um

1208
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,440
and if not i really would want folks to

1209
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,160
be thinking about that as as we go

1210
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,480
forward

1211
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,319
so if anybody has any thoughts or also

1212
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,920
any other since we have a little bit of

1213
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,040
time

1214
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
uh chairs kind of

1215
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,359
last time we last couple times we ran

1216
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,280
out of time with an hour

1217
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
and this time of course we scaled her

1218
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,440
for longer and

1219
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,839
did not have as many presentations so

1220
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,200
um if anybody has anything else they

1221
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,200
want to discuss

1222
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,720
you can take some time at the mic

1223
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,040
well

1224
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,800
yeah i still have my

1225
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,400
other eep document um

1226
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,200
which i think may still be interesting

1227
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,000
um based on feedback from various people

1228
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,839
including elliot lear

1229
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,680
i need to split that into

1230
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,720
discovery versus configuration so in

1231
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,599
short the proposal was

1232
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,640
put a couple more oids into certificates

1233
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,440
and substantial amounts of

1234
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,480
deep configuration become easy

1235
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,680
um

1236
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,720
there is

1237
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,040
something similar in the wi-fi alliance

1238
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,559
that got pushed through

1239
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,559
um based on stefan winter's work

1240
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,559
the second part of the document is

1241
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,760
well-defined srv records for discovering

1242
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,880
all this

1243
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,920
so the

1244
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,520
theory for people who haven't seen the

1245
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,640
document

1246
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
is you should be able to say

1247
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,760
i want to connect to example.com

1248
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,319
and based on a couple of

1249
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,480
um dns lookups and

1250
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,280
and web server lookups um you can get

1251
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,839
all your configuration for eep

1252
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,599
including ca server certificates etc

1253
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,559
so that

1254
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,480
turns the eep configuration from

1255
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,160
something relatively complex to

1256
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,040
something

1257
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,440
fairly simple

1258
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,079
so is there any desire to do uh

1259
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,359
like another password-based

1260
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,480
authenticated

1261
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,119
exchange and eep so there's epwd which

1262
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,720
is unfortunately informational and it's

1263
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,440
also unfortunate that it does the

1264
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
the hunting and pecking version of

1265
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,960
dragonfly instead of the the hashtag

1266
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,240
version but since cfrg has produced uh

1267
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,800
cpace from their uh

1268
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,119
pake competition

1269
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,160
it might

1270
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,079
if there's

1271
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,440
desire might make sense to have a

1272
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,960
password that uses

1273
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,520
cpas

1274
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,440
or does any if nobody cares then

1275
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,559
there's no point doing it but

1276
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
i don't know

1277
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,280
yeah i haven't i haven't heard of

1278
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,960
anybody wanting to do that but

1279
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,680
we'll see

1280
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,359
yep

1281
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,880
john yes

1282
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
i think uh

1283
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,119
ellen's two draws here

1284
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,520
highlights the need for

1285
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,920
more guidance and maybe

1286
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,280
requirements

1287
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,000
on

1288
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,839
how to use certificates and certificate

1289
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,400
configuration

1290
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,440
in

1291
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,760
in eep that's

1292
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,160
severely missing so i think

1293
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,000
even you should work at that in the

1294
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,720
future also strong interest from

1295
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,480
to use more in constrained

1296
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,119
radio networks i think that's also

1297
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,599
something

1298
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,520
i think emu should work on and

1299
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,480
whether

1300
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,280
this

1301
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,319
a shorter update or not

1302
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,000
maybe paul has to answer but i think

1303
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,200
this should be worked on

1304
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,559
okay

1305
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,400
um yeah i think we'll we'll have to take

1306
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,079
some of this discussion to the list but

1307
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,680
i think you you know

1308
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,359
those are some areas that i think we

1309
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,440
have uh proposals in and

1310
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,400
active

1311
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,720
you know people who want to work on that

1312
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,559
you know in terms of ad hoc and uh

1313
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,520
and allen's draft and and i think uh uh

1314
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,040
you know friedrich's draft also was was

1315
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,920
along a similar line so

1316
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,880
um

1317
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,559
there may be something there that that

1318
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,839
we could

1319
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,880
uh expand the chartered to kind of cover

1320
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,000
um

1321
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,200
but i think we need to have a little

1322
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,359
more discussion

1323
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,559
i don't know if paul if you have

1324
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,839
anything but

1325
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,078
yeah

1326
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,599
all right if uh nobody else has any

1327
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,520
comments i think we can adjourn early

1328
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:13,599
yeah

1329
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,680
um sorry uh i i didn't really manage to

1330
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,119
to get uh

1331
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,480
my draft published before this meeting

1332
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,559
so i'm still working on it but

1333
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,920
um i just wanted to to

1334
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,880
get a

1335
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,119
heads up that i will publish a new

1336
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,079
version of my draft that i presented at

1337
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,160
the 113

1338
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,280
the

1339
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,400
utter

1340
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,760
draft and

1341
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,480
i would be happy to receive any feedback

1342
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,640
also on

1343
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,880
if there's any implementation of noob

1344
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
that i'm not aware of

1345
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,040
because i'm i'm still comparing

1346
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,440
noob to my new version

1347
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,240
so

1348
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,799
um i will be sending uh to the list

1349
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,480
because i haven't received any feedback

1350
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,440
from

1351
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,079
since atf-113

1352

thanks take care

1357
