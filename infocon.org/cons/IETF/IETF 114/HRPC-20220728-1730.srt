um also thanks to folks who attended in

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,220
the room I'm gonna have to do a few

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,300
things

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,680
um about people in the room even though

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
most of our participants are online

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,080
um so reminder that if you are wanting

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,060
to get into the queue later you'll need

28
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,879
to join meet Echo from your mobile phone

29
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,640
or from your computer to get in the

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,340
queue so please do that also for the

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,780
blue sheets

32
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,800
um reason

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,819
um

34
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,400
then also please remember you have to

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,900
keep your mask on there aren't a lot of

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,060
us who are pretty spread out but it's an

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,560
important reminder

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
um because it's the policy of the event

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,959
um and yeah I think actually that's it

40
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,819
so from here then we'll just transition

41
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,099
into the welcome slide so give me a

42
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,179
moment to bring those up

43
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,099
I've forgotten how to do this actually

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,019
no it's not that hard

45
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,200
Mallory can you please see the mic

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,760
is it still faint okay

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
it's loud in this room though that's the

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,260
problem

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,980
um

50
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,140
all right so

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,480
um this is the agenda we can certainly

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,519
take suggestions to it because I think

53
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
we have a full two hours and and plenty

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
of of time but we have

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,080
um two speakers

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,659
um and

57
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,940
um as well we have two drafts to talk

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,099
about so we'll take those in turn both

59
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,420
speakers are going to have 30 minutes

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,879
and then essentially we have an hour for

61
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,900
other

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,739
um

63
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,620
for other working group stuff which is

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,939
great

65
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,040
um before we get started I think this is

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,659
more of a reminder I'll make after the

67
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,000
the talks but we we do need to take

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
notes so if somebody can commit now to

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,799
taking notes particularly during the

70
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
time we're talking about uh working

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
group documents that would be really

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,159
great so I'm going to pause for a second

73
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,238
and wait for a volunteer

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,900
would really love notes

75
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,500
um

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,540
so I'll do another reminder after the

77
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
speakers are done hopefully I'll

78
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
remember because yeah we need to capture

79
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,000
um action points from these two drafts

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
you can you can take them and then

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,419
upload them afterwards but it's entirely

82
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,040
up to you I'll make another announcement

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840
and make we'll see we'll see but thank

84
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,820
you very much for

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,300
okay so um we have the note well

86
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,919
the note well has several different

87
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,080
portions of it that by now you've seen

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,360
many times but the first portion is

89
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
around election intellectual property so

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
know your responsibilities around that

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
um an important one as well

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,220
um part is the part of the note well is

93
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,500
the privacy and code of conduct So

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,199
within that know that this session is

95
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
being recorded

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
um and other than that you just need to

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,440
familiarize yourself with

98
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,639
um with this policy

99
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,000
um so I'm going to talk a little bit

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
about

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,360
um and welcome you all to the hrpc

102
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,940
session which is part of

103
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,460
um the irtf internet research task force

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,380
we're looking at the longer term

105
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,320
research issue related to human rights

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,139
as with other

107
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,479
research groups within the irtf we're

108
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,820
not developing standards but we are

109
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,740
writing documents

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,320
um we publish informational documents

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,139
mostly in the hrpc with the RFC series

112
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,199
we have one which I'll get to

113
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,780
um but we're here to promote

114
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,900
um research in this area so we're also

115
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,819
looking to collaborate with others doing

116
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,560
research and other research institutions

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,400
and it's an explicit goal of the irtf

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,560
you can read more about the irtf in RFC

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,220
7418

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,819
So This research group is specifically

121
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,120
chartered to look at the ways that the

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,199
universal Declaration of Human Rights is

123
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,419
um its own sort of standard to some

124
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,940
degree and how it overlaps and aligns

125
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,220
with

126
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,120
standards development for the long-term

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,460
sustainability of the internet

128
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,259
um

129
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,419
we have in our Charter these main

130
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,160
objectives so we're looking at the

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
relationship as I said we have a

132
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,500
specific focus in the udhr on um

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
two main rights the first is uh freedom

134
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,599
of expression and the other is freedom

135
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,940
of Association and assembly but we do

136
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,340
look at others with respect to the right

137
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,020
to privacy which is obviously one that

138
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,180
all people know pretty well there's

139
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,560
another research group that talks about

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,919
privacy considerations and we do some of

141
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,419
that here obviously because it is human

142
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,099
right but there is a different research

143
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,080
group for that and um

144
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,880
um yeah if you've not been to pair G you

145
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,080
really ought to it's a really

146
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,639
interesting working group or research

147
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,479
group

148
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,220
um yeah thanks very much Nick thanks for

149
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,599
taking notes

150
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,360
um we've got that covered then

151
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,819
um and then yes the last bullet point um

152
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,340
a lot of us that are engaged in hrpc I

153
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,599
don't know what the sort of

154
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,880
proportionality is with other people

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,099
that work in the ietf we tend to work a

156
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,440
lot outside the ietf and the larger

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,560
internet governance space and we're sort

158
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,599
of really talking a lot about the work

159
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,740
here outside of the ietf irtf and I

160
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,800
think bring a lot of those experiences

161
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,199
in working outside of this space brings

162
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,699
a lot of important perspective to the

163
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,099
work then that we end up doing

164
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,379
um here in the irtf2 so that's an

165
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,440
explicit goal or objective of hrpc as

166
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,759
well

167
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,699
um so we do drafts we've um helped

168
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,800
others have uh you know written academic

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,879
papers

170
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,979
um we have there's a short film about

171
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,660
the work we've done that was put out

172
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,520
quite a while ago

173
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,379
um data analysis and visualization has

174
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,020
also been um part of of what we've had

175
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,479
folks present on in the past and work on

176
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,940
in and outside hrpc

177
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,680
um and then there's a bunch of us that

178
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,660
tend to do reviews

179
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,580
um outside of this working group or

180
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,620
research group and we're mostly focused

181
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,820
then on thinking about what those

182
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,260
impacts would have

183
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,779
um on human rights and vice versa so

184
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,860
these are a bunch of different things

185
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,599
we're doing not all of it is writing

186
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,180
drafts as you'll notice so part of being

187
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,320
active in hrpc there's a lot of room for

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Creative creative contribution

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,060
and these are the main things we've got

190
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,279
on our on our plate I'm going to take

191
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,839
this off because I'm having trouble

192
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,899
breathing the

193
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,300
um we were sort of Chartered

194
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,420
um way back in 2015 there was work that

195
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
led to that moment that was pretty

196
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,440
important and we've also had an RFC

197
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,320
published that really lays out the gamma

198
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
of work

199
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,220
um between the you know human rights

200
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,779
space and the protocol consideration

201
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,339
space RFC 8280

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,019
current Rook we have two drafts right

203
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:25,860
now

204
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,260
um our draft guidelines is very much an

205
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,320
iteration on the the 8280 draft that

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
lays out a little bit more succinctly or

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,560
concisely for protocol designers what

208
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,980
they might be looking for with respect

209
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,899
to Human Rights so it's more of a sort

210
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,200
of checklist or or guidance document

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,820
right that's

212
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,100
um in the queue already

213
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,560
um I think it might be with the ircf

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,420
chair and then freedom of Association

215
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,640
the internet we have a full discussion

216
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,779
planned for you today because there's

217
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,519
been an update to that there are other

218
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,620
drafts in this group that have expired

219
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,740
but so we've not considered those for

220
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,420
now so

221
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,260
um

222
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,240
these are the

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,640
talks

224
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,040
so I will take each one in turn but

225
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,200
before I move on just wanted to make

226
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,399
sure

227
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,260
there are no questions or I'm not

228
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,420
forgetting anything in the welcome

229
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,120
Sophie do you have anything you want to

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,399
say hey welcome thank you

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,019
great I'm just taking a moment as well

232
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
all right great for off so glad to have

233
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,459
you with you with us um you're gonna

234
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,260
talk us on Computing with uh within

235
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,399
limits

236
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,140
um and I will let you introduce yourself

237
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,720
but just to say we're really happy that

238
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,480
you've come to talk to us about this um

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,660
really want the rest of the

240
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,260
um the folks here to realize that there

241
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,820
have been a lot of discussion of these

242
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,920
same topics in other places in the ietf

243
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,500
and I think that's valuable and so we're

244
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,660
really happy to also be a place where

245
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,120
people can discuss

246
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
what the computation what impact

247
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
computation itself is having

248
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,240
um on on the environment on the

249
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,860
sustainability of the internet so please

250
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,200
go ahead I'm going to put myself well I

251
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,579
can't put myself on mute but I'm going

252
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,959
to hand you

253
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,740
um

254
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm gonna hand you the rain sounds good

255
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,380
I can do this let's see there we go

256
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,720
all right

257
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,279
and let's see if it gave me

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,920
I think I need permission to share

259
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,420
slides or should I just share screen

260
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,620
oh there we go

261
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,320
okay so yeah thanks for inviting me

262
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,920
um

263
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,240
this is going to be a little bit of a

264
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,339
weird talk in a lot of different ways um

265
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,399
in that uh hopefully it won't be boring

266
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,440
that I reflect a little bit on what

267
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
brought me to

268
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,220
thinking about these topics because

269
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,320
usually it's about the content itself

270
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
but I think the process of getting to

271
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
thinking about these questions in this

272
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,459
way was itself part of the challenge so

273
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,560
um what I kind of want to talk about is

274
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,540
this really big picture question of

275
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,839
where we headed globally from Mostly I'm

276
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,040
going to be talking about a sort of a

277
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,560
sustainability perspective uh ecological

278
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,120
sustainability and related

279
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,339
sustainabilities

280
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,720
um and then of course what can be done

281
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
about it what should be done about it

282
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,279
and you know my background before I

283
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,860
started thinking about these questions

284
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,300
was a very traditional sort of

285
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
networking background when I did my PhD

286
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,680
in networking you know I wasn't working

287
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,940
on any

288
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,220
sustainability or energy or any of that

289
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,459
kind of stuff it was it was all you know

290
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,720
relatively standard congestion control

291
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,420
uh you know routing protocols uh privacy

292
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,220
and security those were sort of the

293
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,339
areas of my my research focus and they

294
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,680
still are to a certain extent today but

295
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,720
I went from that being 100 of my

296
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,959
research to a third of my research being

297
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,360
sort of traditional networking a third

298
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,240
of it being privacy and security and

299
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,820
then a third of it being things like

300
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,260
Agriculture and urban planning and

301
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,120
um things that don't have anything to do

302
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,600
with my my actual formal background

303
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
um and what the the steps that it took

304
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,940
sort of for me to decide to work on that

305
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,800
kind of stuff is what's a little bit I

306
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,779
want to want to talk about and then we

307
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,279
can have a discussion about

308
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,720
you know what are the important

309
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,100
questions that we need to be working on

310
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,500
and how do we sort of address them using

311
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,720
our backgrounds

312
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,680
um

313
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,000
so

314
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,339
you know this this notion of limits has

315
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,920
been on my mind for quite some time and

316
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,860
you know the term uh really sort of came

317
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,100
to prominence from the classic study

318
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,980
limits to growth uh in the 1970s and

319
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,019
then it was updated several times and

320
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,820
the interesting thing about that study

321
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,320
which I'll I'll have a little bit more

322
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,019
about later is that it's actually deeply

323
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,260
insightful but it kind of got lost over

324
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,480
the years it got it was got a lot of

325
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,760
popular sort of attention in the 1970s

326
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,699
then it got dismissed in the 1980s

327
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,420
because people interpreted it as a

328
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,000
prediction that all of a sudden you know

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,100
the world would run out of food or

330
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,320
something like that and so which wasn't

331
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,540
what it actually said

332
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,360
um and then it got kind of ignored but

333
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,399
the actual core message of it is quite

334
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,660
important

335
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,480
um that you know the there are

336
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,699
ecological limits that the world lives

337
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,459
within and it would be good to

338
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,740
understand what is the dynamic of that

339
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,839
and so as systems people I think we can

340
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,399
kind of appreciate that systems have

341
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,899
various Dynamics they have feedback

342
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,699
loops they have you know ecological

343
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,860
systems social systems economic systems

344
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,360
technological systems they all have

345
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
these feedback loops

346
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,040
and limits to growth was a study of how

347
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,540
do those feedback loops interact with

348
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,940
various policy mechanisms with various

349
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,100
ecological mechanisms economic

350
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,620
mechanisms and they try to come up with

351
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,300
lots of scenarios to think about the

352
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,880
world and so

353
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,040
I was thinking I think really starting

354
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,699
around maybe 2008 2009 about

355
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,480
how do those limits manifest for

356
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,500
computing

357
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,120
and so there's two different pieces to

358
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,899
it what are the impacts to Computing of

359
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,440
limits and what are the contributions

360
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,480
both positive and negative that

361
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,300
Computing can make to the limits that

362
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,180
Society faces globally

363
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,220
um and so you know a natural place that

364
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,720
I started which is where I think

365
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,420
everybody starts in Computing is how do

366
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,160
we use energy because you know Computing

367
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,320
fundamentally requires you know

368
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
significant energy and our Global

369
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
footprint of computing and energy has

370
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
been going up and up so then the the big

371
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,680
question in my mind and sort of that

372
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,320
time frame was how do we use energy what

373
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,180
are the consequences first I want to

374
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,800
understand the global energy picture and

375
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,360
then sort of narrow down onto the

376
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,339
Computing energy picture

377
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,480
um and you know there are some natural

378
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
places that you start even then it's the

379
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,860
personal footprint so you know there's

380
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,480
lots of calculators I'm sure you've seen

381
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,579
them carbon footprint energy footprint

382
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,860
you can go and find your own and you

383
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,100
know the sort of the broad notion out

384
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,040
there in sustainability world is we

385
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,560
should Target everybody living a 2000

386
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,279
Watt uh lifestyle that is sort of where

387
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,440
you want to be in the U.S we're sort of

388
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,740
averaging above 10 000 watts per person

389
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,180
um though really we want to be closer to

390
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,399
2000 watts per person globally

391
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,160
um to to both have sort of sustainable

392
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,039
uh energy use but also Equitable energy

393
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,059
use

394
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,400
so you know I looked into this was my

395
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
personal footprint when I ran it through

396
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,459
one of these calculators several years

397
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,780
ago

398
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,819
um and so I was thinking about that and

399
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,380
then said okay well where do we get

400
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,179
energy from and that takes you down the

401
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,980
usual rabbit holes of like oh wait will

402
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,260
we use a lot of oil so what why do we

403
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,780
use oil well it's really use useful and

404
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,160
you know we don't think about these

405
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,480
questions very often as computer

406
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,100
scientists

407
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,980
um and so what are we going to do after

408
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,380
we start running a little bit low on

409
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,960
these fossil fuels that provide most of

410
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,419
the calorie input into the foods that we

411
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,039
eat and so you know and all the things

412
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,740
that are made from oil are sort of all

413
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,179
around us that we don't even think about

414
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,860
them on a daily basis

415
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,840
and so these fossil fuels that are

416
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,559
depleting that you know are used also in

417
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,200
as a strategic resource right so there's

418
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,120
geopolitical and economic considerations

419
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,620
there

420
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,600
um we think okay well let's make things

421
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,780
more efficient maybe Society can be made

422
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,520
more efficient maybe Computing can be

423
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
made up for more efficient and maybe

424
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
Computing and make Society more

425
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,679
efficient right we've considered all of

426
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,960
those things societally and in the

427
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,179
research community

428
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,980
um and then there's the other sort of

429
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
twin problem there's the energy problem

430
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,660
which exacerbates climate change but

431
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,700
there also is energy by itself as a

432
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,539
problem

433
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,760
um in terms of the non-renewability and

434
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
finite resources and also just uh sort

435
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,500
of uneven distribution of those

436
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
resources but the climate change uh

437
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,200
picture has both clarified and

438
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,539
intensified since I started looking into

439
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,220
this question

440
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,140
um and it's not just me but I'm saying

441
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,179
from my sort of personal Journey looking

442
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,820
into this uh you know starting maybe 15

443
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,860
years ago

444
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,460
um and you know we all know sort of we

445
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,520
hear degree C in the news and we sort of

446
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,020
have a notion of what these things

447
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,260
actually mean and you know a fair amount

448
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,140
of climate science is basically saying

449
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,760
and has been saying for quite some time

450
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
that there isn't much of a chance to

451
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,860
actually stay below what's considered

452
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,140
quote unquote dangerous levels of

453
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,700
climate change

454
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,200
um given the actual emissions

455
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,960
trajectories that the world has been on

456
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,500
um and so there's this question of like

457
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,320
what do we do about these this these

458
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,020
twin problems that exist that then

459
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,919
affect everything they affect uh you

460
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,900
know everything in every sector of Life

461
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,000
across the world

462
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,200
um

463
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,660
and so you know we have the usual two

464
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,419
choices we can change our behavior and

465
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,000
we use fewer resources we use less

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,880
energy and we can change the sources and

467
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
find more

468
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,419
um and so you know this naturally led me

469
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,200
down that path uh Tom Murphy from UC San

470
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,179
Diego has an excellent book and website

471
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,280
so his website was do the math he

472
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,200
compiled all of his writings into a book

473
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,840
that's freely available things called

474
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,679
um

475
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,080
energy and human ambition on a finite

476
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,419
Planet I think is the name that you can

477
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,980
find it on do the math

478
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,840
um and so this is one of the tables he

479
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,640
put together he went and he did a sort

480
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,559
of uh first principle Deep dive on all

481
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,900
of the different uh

482
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,179
you know energy options that are out

483
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,340
there and he said

484
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,799
what's what's the best option that's

485
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,179
available what are the different

486
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,039
criteria that we should care about you

487
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,840
know how abundant is it difficult to

488
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,059
produce does it produce electricity and

489
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,039
heat and can be used for transportation

490
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,760
Etc

491
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,159
so this is all of the Alternatives and

492
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,140
he sort of created this very rough

493
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,900
categorization ranking for them

494
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,400
um and so you see solar is sort of at

495
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,659
the top and then there's a number of

496
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,760
other popular Renewables the highest

497
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,500
score in his little table here is five

498
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,720
for solar and then he said what about

499
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,820
fossil fuels

500
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,940
and it reminds you very quickly of well

501
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,280
this is why we use those those sources

502
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,900
of energy

503
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,240
if you leave out and he intentionally

504
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,580
left out the climate impact of these

505
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,020
things just to consider the current uh

506
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,640
non-uh sort of internalized costs of

507
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
these because sort of climate change has

508
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
been an externality for all for all this

509
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,260
time

510
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,039
um

511
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,260
people have a real good reason to

512
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,720
continue using fossil fuels and it's

513
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,700
hard to scale up those Alternatives and

514
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
so you know I looked into you know well

515
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,679
why haven't we gotten what we thought we

516
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,059
were going to get in terms of

517
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,240
alternative energy sources what are the

518
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,100
Alternatives available can we move

519
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,539
Computing to them and can we move

520
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,820
Society to those Alternatives and then

521
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,299
it's happening but it's happening slowly

522
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,100
um and so if you actually so Saul

523
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,720
Griffith had been giving this excellent

524
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,740
talk

525
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,419
um and it's still sort of a good talk to

526
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,419
go watch about uh you know what are the

527
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,919
different energy options how quickly do

528
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,720
we need to build stuff and so we said

529
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,100
okay well let's say we have this sort of

530
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,460
as our power profile sources of energy

531
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,059
uh you know in 2035 something like that

532
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,240
so uh you know you still have a little

533
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,799
bit of fossil fuels you have a little

534
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,020
bit more of everything else

535
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,240
um and

536
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,000
then he said okay well how fast would

537
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,620
you have to build this

538
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,419
because it's a physical infrastructure

539
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,340
that has to be built across the globe

540
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,200
and so these are roughly the numbers

541
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,419
that he came up with of you know you'd

542
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,700
have to build to build just that little

543
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,280
wedge of solar photovoltaic you need 100

544
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,559
square meters of foldable voltaics built

545
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,320
and deployed every second uh globally

546
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,840
for 20 years

547
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,380
um and so on down the list and so then I

548
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,720
I thought okay well how feasible is this

549
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,520
so let's look at the manufacturing

550
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,260
capacity so I went and looked into what

551
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,559
does the industry estimate and

552
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,460
it's not you know maybe it's half of

553
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,860
what the best uh estimates and

554
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,659
optimistic estimates for manufacturing

555
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,000
this stuff is something like half for

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,220
each of these categories

557
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,620
um and so what that sort of led me to

558
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,480
conclude is that we need to do sort of a

559
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,299
crash program to over 20 years to cut

560
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,520
our energy use and even if we did that

561
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,260
as fast as possible we'd probably be

562
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,500
about 50 short of our targets which

563
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,539
means probably we're going to end up

564
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,340
overshooting on the climate side rather

565
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,080
than cutting our energy use proactively

566
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,419
so that leaves us in sort of a you know

567
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,820
a difficult position right and that

568
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,320
brings us back to the limits to growth

569
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,919
so you know the thing that they had

570
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,419
considered was they said okay well

571
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,679
there's a lot of different scenarios

572
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,000
about where the world is and so they

573
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,640
took a baseline scenario scenario one in

574
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,140
their models and they said we have the

575
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,940
resources we have today we have the

576
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,679
ecosystem functions we have today the

577
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,419
policies we have today this is the

578
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,700
update from 2004.

579
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,559
um and they said

580
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
what happens if we just run those that

581
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,659
simulation forward in time

582
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,279
um they said well we end up with a

583
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,559
resource crisis a resource crisis in

584
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,220
their terms is where because of uh

585
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,039
insufficient non-renewable resources

586
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,559
specifically uh you know fossil fuels

587
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,020
industrial output and thus economic

588
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,299
output starts faltering sometime in the

589
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,880
2020s is what you know and the exact

590
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,919
numbers of course don't you know their

591
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,539
simulation doesn't have the granularity

592
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,919
to be able to deliver that kind of

593
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,020
detail but that was sort of the time

594
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,000
frame that they were saying uh things

595
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,039
would start faltering and then they said

596
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,520
well the world may discover greater more

597
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,799
energy resources somewhere they may be

598
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,900
doing you know through more oil drilling

599
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,820
you know and gas drilling we've seen

600
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,919
that in the fracking boom and all sorts

601
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,620
of other sort of ways that oil and other

602
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,600
resources might be extracted so they

603
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
said what happens if we have way more

604
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,100
resources big scenario two

605
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,440
in scenario two you end up with a

606
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,020
pollution crisis the economic crisis

607
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,419
gets delayed about 20 years because

608
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,580
you're able to find more resources so

609
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,400
you can keep the economic growth going

610
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,700
but you then overshoot on pollution and

611
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,980
then the ecosystem crashes and as a

612
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,960
result of that food production and other

613
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,419
things start declining rapidly and so

614
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,760
then you end up with you know uh sort of

615
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,240
a Sharp decline later

616
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,679
um you know by 20 years or 30 years

617
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,120
something like that

618
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
and so the thing that sort of struck me

619
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,200
after I went through this process myself

620
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,820
of thinking about you know what's my

621
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,860
role in this when what's the state of

622
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,539
the world about this and then I came

623
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,980
back to the limits to growth and said

624
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
okay what were they really talking about

625
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,120
we're kind of stuck between these two

626
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,220
scenarios right now

627
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,659
um and we're kind of facing them down

628
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,940
simultaneously if you you know just read

629
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,400
the news daily you'll see we're kind of

630
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,039
facing down these exact two scenarios on

631
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,260
a daily basis right now it's not clear

632
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,820
which one of them we're in but it seems

633
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,799
like we're in half of one and half the

634
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,419
other

635
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:01,020
um

636
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,640
and you know people have been talking

637
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,200
about this from a long for a long time

638
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,720
so you know I found that Carter had been

639
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,299
talking about this in 1974.

640
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,279
um this was during the time when there

641
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,400
were sort of more manifest energy limits

642
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,039
that were apparent and then through more

643
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,640
Drilling and sort of you know uh

644
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,860
you know other sort of factors

645
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,039
you know this was sort of Forgotten

646
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:26,700
um

647
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,500
and so that sort of brings me back to

648
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,240
okay well what do we do about this what

649
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,740
do we do about this both as individuals

650
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,980
and then also as computer scientists

651
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,179
um and then even more specifically

652
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,400
perhaps as networking people but I you

653
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,340
know I try not to put that hat on unless

654
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,720
I have to in this question

655
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,159
so the natural places that people go and

656
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,080
I've you know there's more attention to

657
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,000
this now and I think it's great

658
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,400
um is sustainable Computing and I want

659
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,440
to distinguish sustainable Computing

660
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
from Computing for sustainability

661
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,880
sustainable Computing I see as how do we

662
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,340
make Computing itself sustainable use

663
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,640
fewer resources have less E-Waste use

664
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,580
less electricity you know design for

665
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,340
reuse and repair you know all of that

666
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,419
kind of stuff I would put under

667
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,520
sustainable computing then there's

668
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,200
Computing for sustainability which is

669
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,179
how do we use Computing to make the rest

670
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,980
of society all the different things that

671
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,720
we do in our daily lives more

672
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,919
sustainable

673
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,360
and so

674
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,580
you know what's sort of been done in

675
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,799
that and what's important I would say

676
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,840
that I what I've kind of concluded is

677
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,419
that the ratio of importance in my mind

678
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,179
is five to ninety five percent

679
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,980
sustainable Computing itself is

680
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,899
important we should put our efforts into

681
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,159
it

682
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,200
um but at the end of the day Computing

683
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
uses a small amount of total resources

684
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,260
globally probably around five percent of

685
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,020
energy and so you know part of the way

686
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,460
that I sort of came to this conclusion

687
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,640
was uh in 2011 I've been wondering about

688
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,159
this question so we wrote a short uh

689
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,740
paper in hot Nets um energy and energy

690
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,559
of the internet where we looked into it

691
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,620
was very rough calculation of what how

692
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,179
much energy does the internet use both

693
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,340
in wall socket power and in the

694
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,080
manufacturing energy that goes into

695
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,820
actually building everything that's used

696
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,460
all of our networking devices uh small

697
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,960
and big

698
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
um and at the time we concluded that the

699
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,100
internet if you include both the

700
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,260
embodied energy and the wall socket

701
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,799
power something like 300 gigawatts uh

702
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
Global so it's everything

703
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,899
um a grad student who I work with uh

704
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,299
updated these numbers last year and I

705
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,460
think it's maybe doubled or two and a

706
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,279
half times in over 10 years

707
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,159
um so but the amount of traffic that the

708
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,440
internet carried has uh per year has

709
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,960
gone up way more than that so the

710
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
efficiency of the internet has actually

711
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
gone up quite a bit so the sort of

712
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,919
joules per byte

713
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,260
um has plummeted over 10 years which is

714
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,360
really a testament to the networking

715
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,340
Community making things much faster and

716
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,080
more efficient without using too much

717
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
more energy to do it so that's great

718
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,179
um so after I'd sort of been looking

719
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,279
into that I thought okay well maybe you

720
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,000
know

721
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,799
we have two choices we can work on

722
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,299
sustainable Computing or Computing for

723
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,559
sustainability

724
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,140
and the conclusion I came to was really

725
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,679
that uh Computing still is a small piece

726
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,899
of the overall puzzle if you actually go

727
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,720
look you know uh agriculture is about a

728
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,779
third of total carbon emissions globally

729
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,720
and transportation is just under that

730
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,820
and power generation is just under that

731
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,880
so these are huge sectors of economic

732
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,720
life and daily life that

733
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,659
are perhaps more uh affecting our

734
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,940
society than Computing is and Computing

735
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,679
can maybe be used to help in this

736
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,960
context

737
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,940
um and so those are the four big ones

738
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,360
that I've started uh looking into I

739
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,500
haven't really done too much on the

740
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,419
manufacturing piece but agriculture

741
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,059
transportation and power generation have

742
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,000
been areas that I've been interested in

743
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,500
um Agriculture and power generation

744
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,480
specifically have sort of focused on

745
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,299
especially the agriculture piece and I

746
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,500
can talk a little bit more about that

747
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,020
research the specific research there if

748
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,419
someone's interested the the gist of it

749
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,039
is that I think it's important not to

750
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,000
bring just an optimization mindset so

751
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,440
the natural thing that I tend to see

752
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,760
when people do Computing for

753
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,620
sustainability is say

754
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,919
look at a some other sector and they're

755
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,779
all desperate for computer scientists at

756
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,760
least they seem to be because they want

757
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,279
our help in processing big data sets and

758
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,080
doing analysis and throwing machine

759
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,880
learning models at everything

760
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,159
but what typically ends up happening is

761
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,440
that it optimizes an already broken

762
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
system to make it slightly less

763
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,000
efficient or slightly more efficient but

764
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,799
that actually further entrenches a

765
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,539
broken system that may be unsustainable

766
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,279
for the long run so in the context of

767
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,380
Agriculture

768
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,940
I've been focused on how do we look at

769
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,919
different systems of Agriculture other

770
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,260
than sort of monoculture industrial

771
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,539
agriculture which is very unsustainable

772
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,059
as it's practiced mostly in everywhere

773
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,860
in the world today

774
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,519
um

775
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,320
because if we optimize that system

776
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
further if we say well we can irrigate a

777
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,580
little better because we can throw this

778
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,519
machine learning model at it or we can

779
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,899
fertilize better then

780
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,539
you know ultimately that system is still

781
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,580
a broken system it's just further

782
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,899
entrenched

783
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,279
um so instead

784
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:32,940
um

785
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,880
it may sound crazy but uh you may

786
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,200
remember this work on headerspace

787
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
analysis that was done uh I don't know

788
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,100
about 10 years ago where they were

789
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,559
looking at uh packet headers and how do

790
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,260
you analyze you know the the state of

791
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,299
all past possible packet headers and all

792
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,919
the things you can do and sort of

793
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,320
there's interesting formal methods that

794
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,360
come out of that it turns out that you

795
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,039
can actually use a states-based type

796
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,200
analysis and apply that thinking to

797
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,760
Agriculture and that's what we've been

798
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,740
doing because agriculture in some ways

799
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,140
is a state-space planning problem

800
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,019
um and so by reconceptualizing it that

801
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,760
way we then are basically searching the

802
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,580
state space of possible Agro ecosystems

803
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,320
to be designed and so that's sort of the

804
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,240
research that I'm doing it's way outside

805
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,820
of the realm of normal networking I'm

806
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,220
working with people from computer

807
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,340
graphics and reinforcement learning and

808
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,340
some actual agriculture people and I do

809
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,580
a lot of Agriculture sort of myself as a

810
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,140
personal interest so

811
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,179
it's a very weird direction for a

812
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,100
networking person to go in

813
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,720
um power generation is something that's

814
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
a little bit closer to home for most

815
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,080
networking folks

816
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,120
um there's a lot of work you can do in

817
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,700
that space on uh sort of micro grids and

818
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,419
uh sort of planning of uh renewable

819
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,100
energy use both for computing and

820
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,178
non-computing uses

821
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,320
Denver's sort of stepping back further

822
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,940
from sectors to the bigger picture

823
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,580
things in in life right how do we

824
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,380
consume things how do we produce things

825
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,120
how do we finance things and how do we

826
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,640
govern and I think those are things that

827
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,360
ITF actually knows quite a bit about in

828
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,980
if you think it's sort of a metal level

829
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,380
of what does ietf do as an organization

830
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
and irtf do as an organization

831
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,220
um

832
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,679
and then there's the even bigger picture

833
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,140
which is extremely challenging as

834
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,419
engineers and researchers is to tackle

835
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,159
but really these are the things that

836
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,140
shape our society

837
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,480
um and force us to make the choices that

838
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,039
we do the culture and the perspective

839
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,320
the flexibility we have with the choices

840
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,760
we make and the wisdom we have been

841
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,980
choosing them

842
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,000
so

843
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,760
Strange Talk I know I'd love to chat

844
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,740
with you all about uh where do we go

845
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,419
from here

846
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:49,740
um and I wanted to finally leave you

847
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,320
with this uh quote from limits to growth

848
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,179
about

849
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,559
where do we go from here

850
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,000
thanks so much baraf I was just

851
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,199
finishing

852
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,940
um reading that quote which is a really

853
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,079
good one

854
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,040
um

855
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,320
the world is far too complex for easy

856
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,899
solutions so thanks for bringing a

857
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,139
really complex talk to us so we've got

858
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,119
the Mike Q open reminder that if you're

859
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,918
on site you want to get in the queue

860
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,000
with the app

861
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,280
thank you

862
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,210
[Music]

863
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,839
yeah the Top Line says not industry is

864
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,639
the cause of all problems or the Cure

865
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,760
and then it goes on to nor governments

866
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,780
is the cause of the Cure

867
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,159
hi broth uh this is a great talk uh this

868
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,418
is Louis Eggert

869
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,280
um I mostly came up because I sort of

870
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
got interested when you mentioned your

871
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,859
hotness paper from way back when because

872
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,300
I remember I started and I forgot about

873
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,380
it

874
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,060
um and thanks for reminding me so the

875
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,859
IEP is actually looking into a workshop

876
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,599
which is not sort of super related but

877
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,260
it's basically looking at the

878
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,000
um environmental footprint of the

879
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,500
internet and its applications and

880
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,180
services

881
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,400
um and I would uh be I'm hoping that

882
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,480
you'd be interested and you have other

883
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
people to bring to that conversation so

884
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,119
I'm going to send you an email about

885
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,980
that I'm also mentioning to other people

886
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,420
in the crowd that might be interested on

887
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,000
that uh you can send email to the hrpc

888
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,200
list and we'll connect you to that

889
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,160
effort thank you

890
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,740
um yeah next in the queue at meals are

891
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,399
you able to get

892
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,099
am I too loud

893
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,420
you're

894
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,700
you're okay thanks so much excellent

895
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,859
talking really uh I got an echo here let

896
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,020
me switch up

897
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,079
so the talk was great and you mentioned

898
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,099
that

899
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,619
like industry actors governments are

900
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,920
entangled in this problem right and and

901
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,060
that comes very clearly from your

902
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,220
analysis but then how would you

903
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,440
translate that back to what individuals

904
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,260
and institutions can do and should do

905
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,960
and how do you think an institution such

906
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,619
as the ITF irtf uh should conceptualize

907
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,900
this so because because I get how we

908
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,119
measured back but how do we measure then

909
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,000
back up and how do we operationalize and

910
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,119
instrumentalize that

911
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,440
yeah that's a great question it's one

912
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,700
I've been struggling with so I don't

913
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,320
think I have a clean answer to it but

914
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
I'll give it a try

915
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,560
um so

916
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,480
you know I the way I look at it is at

917
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,960
the individual level what I I found has

918
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,619
been useful is leveraging my thinking my

919
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,839
sort of systems thinking as a networking

920
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,240
person in applying it in these other

921
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,119
contexts now that's not a direct route

922
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,940
at all because you know that doesn't

923
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,680
that doesn't speak to quite your idea

924
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,320
question I'll try and do that in a sec

925
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,900
um but at least as individuals I found

926
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,900
that we actually do have a unique way of

927
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,140
thinking of systems thinking that really

928
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,660
out there is not very common and what

929
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,480
I've found is ecologists may be as close

930
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,180
to computers networking people as you

931
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,119
will find in other disciplines but

932
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
ecologists get no attention nobody pays

933
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
attention to what ecologists are saying

934
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,700
they've been screaming about this stuff

935
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
for years and everybody's ignored them

936
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,260
to our detriment but they pay attention

937
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,020
to networking folks and so in some ways

938
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,839
when we bring a networking perspective

939
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,180
to these problems we are both

940
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,920
contributing to the systems thinking

941
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,619
which understands the complexity the

942
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,140
feedback loops the how you have to

943
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,180
intervene in systems in complex ways

944
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,280
there's no sort of magic solution that

945
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,540
you know everybody thinks there's a

946
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,480
magic solution to the stuff and we we

947
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,280
understand given the complexity of the

948
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,740
internet that we've got we have to

949
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,660
Grapple with complex systems and we know

950
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,940
how to do it so that's how I think we

951
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,619
actually contribute

952
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,000
um I found that when I talk to these

953
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,560
agriculture colleagues

954
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,079
um they are stuck the few very few

955
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,520
people who want to sort of change the

956
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,099
way agriculture works both in Academia

957
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,119
and Industry

958
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,700
get very little attention

959
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,619
um and it's very sort of reductive

960
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,800
simple approaches that tend to dominate

961
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,880
um but they don't know how to think

962
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,920
computationally and sort of in the way

963
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,180
we do so that's that's at the personal

964
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,440
level

965
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,599
um at the institutional level

966
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,200
um

967
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,140
that gets a little more tricky because

968
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,660
ietf I imagine has a closer mandate tied

969
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,780
to the internet and networking then we

970
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,339
can't you know itf's not going to be

971
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,020
doing anything agriculture related

972
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,500
likely I think anytime soon but the one

973
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,160
place this can tie in is

974
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,619
um a perfect example this is in sort of

975
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,660
renewable energy use of data centers of

976
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,700
networking facilities

977
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,619
um if you look at all the various big

978
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,560
companies they all have tried to at

979
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,480
least have public messaging about we

980
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,040
want to use green energy we want to be

981
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,079
renewable Etc but you look in the fine

982
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:13,920
print

983
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,200
and there's actually important details

984
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,780
that are left out I'd say many of them

985
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,640
are not really doing it

986
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,800
um they do things like they say well

987
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,099
over over the Year we We purchase enough

988
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,260
renewable energy to offset our you know

989
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,859
our usage but the diurnal patterns of

990
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,920
renewable energy tend to completely make

991
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,619
that irrelevant because you can buy a

992
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,359
bunch of useless solar power that's

993
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,099
getting burned because nobody can

994
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,599
consume it during the middle of the day

995
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,000
and then you're buying a bunch of coal

996
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,180
or natural gas power at nighttime and so

997
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,940
that's where standards can percolate up

998
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,079
from the ITF about what does it mean to

999
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,339
say that you are a green Network

1000
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:57,480
facility

1001
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,579
or you know that's just an example but

1002
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,440
oh that kind of thing so it's about what

1003
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,760
Computing and networking is about

1004
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,119
is is that something you might be

1005
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,480
interested in writing interest about

1006
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,099
uh yeah maybe

1007
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,960
um I mean there are probably people who

1008
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,300
have much deeper expertise than me on

1009
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,220
this but I I know some of those folks so

1010
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,520
I can we can rope them in

1011
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
thank you

1012
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,859
um go ahead Nick you're in the queue

1013
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,980
next

1014
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,720
yeah thank you for

1015
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,480
um a very useful and and insightful talk

1016
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,839
I think it's useful for for maybe many

1017
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,700
of us who are in the situation of not

1018
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,560
quite knowing

1019
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,339
um

1020
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,800
all the details of this area but uh

1021
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,599
caring more about it

1022
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,440
um

1023
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,380
to to have some of that context

1024
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,720
um I I'm sort of struck by this sort of

1025
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,440
all people and institutions quote

1026
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,079
um as as maybe addressing the question

1027
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,220
of um

1028
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,240
uh your your sort of earlier point about

1029
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,520
which things are likely to have the most

1030
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,119
impact and and so I I have the intuition

1031
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,319
and maybe since you've thought more

1032
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,240
about this you can give us some insight

1033
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,680
into it

1034
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,819
um

1035
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:26,700
well it seems like well it seems logical

1036
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,680
to work on the largest impact things it

1037
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,180
also sounds like well for an emergency

1038
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,640
situation where we have to reduce energy

1039
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,859
usage by this enormous amounts that

1040
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,000
we're actually going to have to work in

1041
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,520
all areas in parallel rather than just

1042
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,400
working on the largest areas so yeah

1043
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,460
maybe 600 gigawatts is not that much

1044
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,859
still sounds like still sounds like

1045
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,180
quite a bit

1046
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,020
um

1047
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,240
so I I wonder if that means like we we

1048
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,579
should be trying to make

1049
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,819
everything sustainable even not the uh

1050
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:58,859
largest users but I'm also curious if

1051
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,540
there's like General things

1052
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,200
foreign

1053
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,700
yeah so you know I absolutely agree that

1054
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,740
it is important to work on all things

1055
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,420
you know it's not that we don't want to

1056
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,380
work on energy use of computing because

1057
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,940
agriculture is a bigger impact globally

1058
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,579
the part of the reason that I focused on

1059
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,400
things outside of computing and making

1060
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,440
Computing more efficient is that

1061
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,260
the incentives are already lined up for

1062
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,900
larger companies to

1063
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,880
um make Computing more efficient simply

1064
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,859
because Renewable Power has become

1065
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,220
cheaper and it's easier to power

1066
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,140
Computing using renewable energy so at

1067
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,180
least from the operational energy use

1068
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,400
standpoint of data centers and so on

1069
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,680
that's already happening so you know my

1070
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,900
attention there isn't going to improve

1071
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,599
or hinder things lack of attention is

1072
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,220
going to hinder things whereas in

1073
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,200
agriculture there's so much they're the

1074
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,220
low-hanging fruit is enormous uh and you

1075
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,800
know not very much is being done

1076
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,460
um

1077
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,800
so that's that's part of the reason

1078
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,359
um in terms of energy use of computing

1079
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,040
one of the things that struck me and it

1080
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
hasn't really changed that much

1081
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,119
um when we did that 2011 study we found

1082
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,880
50 of the energy use was the embodied

1083
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,599
power so it's the manufacturing energy

1084
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,680
amortized over the lifespan of the

1085
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,000
device

1086
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,420
um and that really points to keeping

1087
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,520
things longer keeping old equipment

1088
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,160
running longer

1089
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,599
especially if you can just run it on

1090
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,160
Renewable Power when the Renewable Power

1091
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,280
is available is actually a net win from

1092
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,280
an energy standpoint and so that is a

1093
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,020
whole agenda I think an interesting

1094
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,359
networking and systems agenda on its own

1095
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,240
how do you keep old stuff running in a

1096
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,280
way that it's still useful to delivering

1097
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,859
you know to running systems

1098
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,900
um and do it in a way that you only run

1099
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,040
it when there's Renewable Power

1100
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,339
available

1101
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,280
foreign

1102
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,280
great perspective and I'm wondering if

1103
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,140
you could say a word about at this

1104
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,540
intersection between ietf and the

1105
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,460
perspective you you share this very

1106
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,700
Global Perspective thus culture stand

1107
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,540
out as the opportunity where ietf could

1108
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,440
do a lot more in order to impact all the

1109
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,020
secondary things that only culture

1110
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,260
uh can really change

1111
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,700
thank you

1112
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,160
yeah maybe so the the thing I don't

1113
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,960
quite know is

1114
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,040
what is the interface between ietf and

1115
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,140
the broader Computing community and

1116
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,359
what's the interface of ITF with the

1117
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,119
broading broader World Community right

1118
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,040
so in a sense of

1119
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,880
where does ietf have leverage where it's

1120
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,000
voice as a community actually can make a

1121
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,940
difference outside of the ietf

1122
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,119
um obviously ITF has huge influence in

1123
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,119
the networking World outside of ietf

1124
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,520
it probably has less of an influence at

1125
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,700
the sort of computing World level so not

1126
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,520
networking specific and then maybe like

1127
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,800
even less once you get one step further

1128
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,900
but it may be the case going back to

1129
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,000
this thing about ecologists having very

1130
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,240
little voice in sort of everyday life

1131
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,579
we at least have more of a voice because

1132
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,319
we're providing

1133
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,300
you know critical infrastructure for the

1134
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,079
world and so in that sense people will

1135
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,940
actually listen the question is how do

1136
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,800
we tie it I think to the culture

1137
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,780
question how do we tie the changes we

1138
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,000
want to see in the broader culture to

1139
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,839
what people see as our remit

1140
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,240
um and so probably the the cleanest

1141
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Leverage is relating to internet

1142
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,060
infrastructure one of those can be about

1143
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,920
sustainability of the internet's

1144
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,200
infrastructure you know we can you can

1145
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,060
frame it in many different ways climate

1146
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,660
disasters will lead to Internet outages

1147
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,000
and therefore we need to plan for

1148
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,040
resilience planning for resilience means

1149
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,619
local renewable energy this is how we

1150
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,900
think it should be done and we know

1151
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,140
because we're the idea so that sort of

1152
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,060
provides a through line maybe and then

1153
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,460
the culture piece can then come from out

1154
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,260
of that now I'm just thinking out loud

1155
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,339
though

1156
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,060
thank you

1157
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,740
hello Tom Hill I hope you can hear me

1158
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,319
um an absolutely fascinating quest uh

1159
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,420
talk bro if I actually found that

1160
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,700
incredibly uh interesting I wanted to

1161
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,599
just make a quick point about

1162
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,460
agriculture and and

1163
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,140
um the networking the work we do around

1164
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,780
here iot has a huge role to play

1165
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,099
actually in the efficiency of

1166
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,900
Agriculture and that I've seen some of

1167
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,060
this from where I grew up and

1168
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,560
um certainly some of the work that I

1169
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,940
think my employer has done in the past

1170
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,559
which is quite fun

1171
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,200
um a big a much broader point and I'm

1172
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,400
not sure if this is actually a question

1173
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,460
or just an observation but I've

1174
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,960
obviously in recent times we've we've

1175
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,859
seen some very large leaps in

1176
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,440
um changes around energy usage

1177
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,839
partly because you know something we

1178
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,400
couldn't have necessarily predicted

1179
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,079
someone went to war in another country

1180
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,420
and all of a sudden Energy prices have

1181
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,700
shot up massively across the world

1182
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,980
other things that tend to happen Elon

1183
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,160
Musk tweets about things and suddenly

1184
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,859
um everyone wants to buy his cars or for

1185
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,839
example everyone wants to buy Dogecoin

1186
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,900
instead of Bitcoin vice versa either way

1187
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,059
it goes around

1188
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:05,040
the concern I have is that of course we

1189
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,859
are all in you know we're all tasked

1190
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:08,880
really with making iterative

1191
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,880
improvements to this but I really don't

1192
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,880
I'm not entirely sure how we will

1193
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,660
be able to compete as an organization

1194
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,460
with the

1195
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,240
um the actions of of lunatics Waging War

1196
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,980
and celebrities tweeting I I feel like

1197
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,800
that much more could be done or undone

1198
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,680
in those respects to the point where I'm

1199
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,540
I'm not sure how much the ietf could

1200
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,280
contribute in this place I mean all of

1201
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,720
the work that we could do multiple years

1202
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,660
could be unpicked in a second

1203
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,119
um so

1204
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,859
there are certain things that we could

1205
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:52,319
perhaps in in very broad sways look at

1206
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,420
um

1207
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,800
enacting I mean I think we really

1208
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,059
probably should take quite an honest

1209
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,040
look at blockchains

1210
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,079
and the amount of electricity that goes

1211
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,760
into running them and keeping them

1212
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,900
running

1213
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,220
um perhaps you know there are definitely

1214
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,440
drafts floating around there's lots of

1215
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,000
research going around on that on that

1216
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,319
subject

1217
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,480
um can we be more honest with ourselves

1218
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,160
about the direction we're taking and and

1219
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,559
the much bigger Concepts around energy

1220
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,079
usage and where we're being wasteful

1221
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,540
and of course a lot of us have come here

1222
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,500
on planes as well to this to this event

1223
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,420
um do we have to be really really honest

1224
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,500
with ourselves about whether or not

1225
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,059
that's appropriate

1226
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,500
and I'm

1227
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,780
I know everyone's desperately happy to

1228
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,359
be back here in the room if they're able

1229
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:39,960
um but as am I but you know should we be

1230
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,619
showing ourselves a as a greater

1231
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,500
example as it were

1232
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,480
um and what are the big

1233
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,220
big things that we can do to grab

1234
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,319
attention on that front I think that's

1235
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,700
that's the about the only way that you

1236
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,720
can deal with Elon Musk and and compete

1237
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,300
with that so anyway um again thank you

1238
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,200
very much it was really really

1239
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,059
fascinating so I think

1240
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:05,579
yeah your point is well taken I agree

1241
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,800
that it it is challenging the scale of

1242
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,480
the problem and also the scale of the

1243
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,119
voices that are out there that can shape

1244
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,480
events are far beyond what ietf can do

1245
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,940
but one thing that also is true is that

1246
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,500
uh

1247
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,920
I often tell people there is a small

1248
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,319
group of folks that you know the ITF

1249
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,880
Community who keeps the internet running

1250
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,460
and you don't know about it but you know

1251
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,380
it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to

1252
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,119
access the internet it didn't happen

1253
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,859
this way

1254
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,800
um and so in some ways not being on the

1255
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,740
in the headlines sometimes can be an

1256
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,440
advantage but you can still ITF actually

1257
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,300
has the power to shape things I mean the

1258
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,880
example I was giving about uh you know

1259
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,760
uh standards for data centers is just a

1260
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,339
minor one but there's also the sort of

1261
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:55,559
climate resilient networking

1262
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,680
um that could be a a long-term

1263
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,020
infrastructure change that occurs and

1264
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,760
then it has Ripple effects throughout

1265
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,220
other uh infrastructures energy

1266
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,280
infrastructure and and so on and so

1267
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,780
um I think that's where the Leverage is

1268
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,000
for or an engineering oriented

1269
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,540
organization

1270
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,319
great um last

1271
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,740
at one of your sides it made me think

1272
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,819
that

1273
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,220
um there's a bunch of trade-offs in this

1274
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,099
work there's a lot of space for thinking

1275
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:30,079
about

1276
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,059
how one solution may have a knock-on

1277
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,819
effects in other areas and negotiating

1278
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,859
that is not trivial

1279
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,319
um and that that happens to be

1280
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,760
um very strongly paralleled in the human

1281
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,500
rights space as well

1282
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,420
um actually a lot of the work that as

1283
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,640
human rights Advocates we do

1284
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,380
um especially in sort of tangential

1285
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,500
areas like uh you know technology

1286
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,180
um is is actually having a conversation

1287
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,880
about trade-offs and where

1288
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,400
um you know you prioritize certain

1289
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,920
rights or certain principles over others

1290
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,960
and what the finer edges of that are so

1291
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,040
that could also potentially be an Avenue

1292
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,780
that could be additive to the larger

1293
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,520
space where a lot of folks have talked

1294
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,599
about one thing or another maybe a sweep

1295
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,160
over all the different options and

1296
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,020
figuring out how to create a principled

1297
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,319
approach to trading off things when they

1298
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,300
come into complex conflict could be

1299
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,640
something that that the folks in hrpc

1300
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,660
would be well suited to attempt

1301
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,319
thanks very much it was awesome thanks

1302
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,900
thanks for having me

1303
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,780
great so hoping we have future work here

1304
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,059
um we always want to try to bring in

1305
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,119
speakers who give us all inspiration for

1306
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,280
areas we could take the work and so I

1307
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,500
think hrpc could be a really good place

1308
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,380
to write and and publish and talk about

1309
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,300
some of this in an ongoing way so we

1310
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,000
hope we hope that you stick around and

1311
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,599
that others can send us pointers for

1312
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,520
um potentially starting documents and

1313
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,020
things

1314
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,819
um okay so with that

1315
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:08,460
um we're now moving on to our next

1316
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,880
speaker

1317
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,240
um

1318
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,979
so Alana are you online

1319
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,200
great welcome you should be able to load

1320
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,000
your own slides

1321
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,339
um by clicking on the

1322
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,460
um

1323
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,260
let's see are you already doing that

1324
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,380
um there you are okay good you've got it

1325
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,099

beautiful thank you

1329
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,640
um so hi everyone uh my name is Lana I

1330
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,859
am a postdoc at Cornell Tech I'm also

1331
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,599
the director of operations at somewhere

1332
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,059
called the clinic 10 Tech abuse

1333
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:55,680
um and I'm really excited to be talking

1334
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,300
to you all about understanding and

1335
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,059
responding to technology abuse

1336
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,220
um and and how that might possibly

1337
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,900
affect

1338
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,599
um what you all do at the ietf

1339
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,700
so um

1340
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,339
let me just learn how to use this slide

1341
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,260
there we go so the way that the stock is

1342
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,579
kind of structured is that I was first

1343
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,980
going to go over uh some background

1344
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,859
information about technology abuse and

1345
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:21,359
that the clinic child Tech abuse and

1346
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,460
myself and what we do and then talk

1347
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,200
about tech abuse and practice from what

1348
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,460
we actually see

1349
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,900
and then I was hoping to end with some

1350
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,640
like open issues some active questions

1351
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,720
that I run across in my day-to-day and

1352
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,200
um and just what some things that we

1353
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,819
can't yet respond to but that we would

1354
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:40,260
like to respond to in the area of tech

1355
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,900
abuse look like

1356
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,480
so um with that I'll start with just

1357
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,040
introducing myself

1358
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,180
um like I said I'm the director of

1359
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,180
operations at the clinic 10 Tech abuse

1360
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,619
um I think some of the most the most

1361
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,059
interesting thing about my background as

1362
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,099
it pertains to this talk is that I have

1363
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,660
a very technical background I received

1364
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,599
my PhD in um databases programming

1365
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,480
languages and systems last year which is

1366
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,859
very different from the work that I do

1367
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:07,619
now but during my academic background I

1368
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,480
also spent time working as a Survivor

1369
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,220
advocate so I was an advocate at the

1370
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,559
Columbia Rape Crisis Center at the rape

1371
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,480
abuse and incest national network I

1372
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,579
worked in consent education

1373
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:19,680
and um I think that both of those

1374
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,720
experiences this like very systems

1375
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,119
oriented technical academic background

1376
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,160
and my background also as a Survivor

1377
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,660
Advocate

1378
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,280
um really shaped the way that I think

1379
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,480
about

1380
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,859
um all of the protocols that we put into

1381
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,599
place when we are trying to help people

1382
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,119
with technology abuse

1383
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,339
and with all that said I think like a

1384
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,380
good next question is what is technology

1385
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,059
abuse

1386
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,799
um this definition is from one of our

1387
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,140
earlier papers at Zeta which is

1388
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,059
um just defines Tech abuse as the many

1389
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:50,640
ways where an abuser can use a digital

1390
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,020
technology

1391
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,619
um to intimidate threaten monitor

1392
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:57,480
impersonate harass or otherwise harm

1393
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,280
their victims

1394
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,099
and so um I'll talk a little bit more

1395
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,500
about what we do at Zeta in a moment but

1396
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,299
just to take an example from one of the

1397
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:08,520
clients that we see who are experiencing

1398
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,799
technology abuse that we've interviewed

1399
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,240
um I think that this quote really wraps

1400
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,460
up how Insidious technology abuse can be

1401
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,720
in

1402
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,760
um certain vulnerable populations such

1403
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,619
as as survivors of intimate partner

1404
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:22,680
violence so the Survivor describes their

1405
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,780
abuser tracking everything that they're

1406
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,240
doing whatever I do he sees that he's

1407
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,520
harassing me until now

1408
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,380
um and the Survivor had an order of

1409
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,140
protection but the harasser the abuser

1410
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,000
was using spoofing apps to harass the

1411
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,220
client from different numbers and

1412
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,839
because the way that our legal systems

1413
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,700
work don't really take into account the

1414
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,760
technological abilities that abusers

1415
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,839
have

1416
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,520
um basically a lot of forms of

1417
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,260
technology abuse are invisibilized by

1418
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,240
courts so even though it was clearly the

1419
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,799
abuser calling from these spoofed phone

1420
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,359
numbers it wasn't the phone number that

1421
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:55,859
was listed under the order of protection

1422
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,140
and so the police would not respond to

1423
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,099
this continuing harassment and abuse so

1424
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:03,540
I think that this example really

1425
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,339
highlights how Insidious Tech abuse can

1426
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,240
be for survivors

1427
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,440
um and when we talk about technology

1428
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,480
abuse and the security threats that

1429
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,099
technology abuse plays in the role of

1430
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,720
intimate partner violence

1431
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,339
um I call them intimate partner violence

1432
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,680
aware threat models and what I mean by

1433
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,359
that is that in computer security we

1434
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,980
have threat models that locate the

1435
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,920
attacker as being this person who has no

1436
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,839
physical proximity or little physical

1437
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,240
proximity and no social proximity to the

1438
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,700
attacker so all the information that the

1439
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,380
Target that the attacker has about the

1440
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,720
target is information that they got

1441
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,760
through their attacks or through their

1442
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,799
infiltration and that's an assumption

1443
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,119
that doesn't hold when we're talking

1444
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:43,500
about intimate partner violence where

1445
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,420
the abuser is someone who is well known

1446
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,880
to the Target and who might have a lot

1447
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,160
of personalized or individualized

1448
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,960
information about the person that

1449
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,940
they're trying to attack

1450
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,099
and what that looks like again to use

1451
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,020
another example from practice from one

1452
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,280
of our like survivors that we've

1453
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,839
interviewed

1454
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:02,940
um the Survivor he was using passwords

1455
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,740
that was a family member's names and

1456
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,480
using family members birthdays as a pen

1457
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,280
which we know is like not necessarily

1458
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,260
the greatest security practice

1459
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,200
but it does mean that for someone who is

1460
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,240
an intimate partner or someone who might

1461
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,280
have information about this person at a

1462
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,200
personal level that they would be able

1463
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,520
to know and guess all of that

1464
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,140
information and know how this person

1465
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,839
deploys their passwords and uses them

1466
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,940
and another issue that comes up is this

1467
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,280
idea of identity verification in the

1468
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,960
second part of this quote where the

1469
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,160
Survivor is saying that they're trying

1470
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,200
to reset their password but because the

1471
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,960
abuser had control over the phone number

1472
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,880
um and the Survivor no longer had access

1473
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,619
to the phone number they couldn't use

1474
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,359
the recovery mechanisms that were in

1475
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,099
place so since they don't have that

1476
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,040
phone number they can't reset anything

1477
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,540
and I'm going to take a second here just

1478
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,920
to talk about what an intimate partner

1479
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,480
is while we're talking about intricate

1480
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,640
partner awareness models

1481
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,079
um I think that this language tends to

1482
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,880
evoke the idea of a romantic partner

1483
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,980
which is absolutely true and many of the

1484
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,440
survivors that we see are are being

1485
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,900
harassed or stalked or abused by a

1486
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,119
former romantic partner but the smart

1487
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:07,500
model is General enough to sort of

1488
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,200
Encompass anyone who has close social

1489
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,960
relationships with the with the victim

1490
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,240
or the Survivor so you can think for

1491
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,640
example children on family members

1492
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,099
people who rely on caretakers so that

1493
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,500
would be people with disabilities

1494
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,640
elderly people

1495
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,099
um and even friends have all I can all

1496
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:27,900
be

1497
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,540
um kind of captured by this threat model

1498
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,500
of an intimate partner

1499
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,760
so

1500
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,420
um

1501
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,160
we have a tech abuse Clinic that

1502
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,020
responds to this and so to kind of set

1503
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,000
up what this what we do in our Clinic is

1504
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,740
that we are a free consultative service

1505
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,280
and we train Volunteers in the Dynamics

1506
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,440
of coercive control

1507
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,880
um and we pair them with survivors who

1508
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,040
are experiencing technology abuse and we

1509
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,359
have these sessions or consultations

1510
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,280
with them one-on-one where we listen to

1511
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,900
their story and we listen to like what's

1512
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,819
going on with their technology and how

1513
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:01,500
they're being harassed or otherwise

1514
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,020
abused and then we try and find ways

1515
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,700
that we can maybe structure

1516
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,500
interventions that respond to their

1517
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,660
specific situation and so this

1518
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,760
definition is borrowed from our friends

1519
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,619
and close collaborators at the

1520
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,299
technology enabled course of control

1521
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,700
clinic in Seattle Dana Cuomo and Natalie

1522
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,440
Dolce I think it really nicely

1523
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,859
encapsulates what a tech abuse clinic is

1524
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:25,559
and Ceta or the clinic to in Tech abuse

1525
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,240
is one of the first such of these

1526
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,220
clinics if not the first it's a

1527
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,900
technology abuse Clinic that's run out

1528
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,160
of Cornell Tech

1529
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,140
um we also act as a research and

1530
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,780
education and a policy Hub generally

1531
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,280
focusing on this intersection of

1532
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,040
intimate partner violence and Technology

1533
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,839
um so the way that sudo works is that we

1534
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,339
actually partner with the New York City

1535
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,440
mayor's office to add domestic and

1536
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,720
gender-based violence and several other

1537
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,180
local agencies in New York City that are

1538
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,500
already working with survivors of

1539
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,720
intimate partner violence and those

1540
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,640
agencies when they see that their

1541
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,299
clients are are having or experiencing

1542
01:00:59,299 --> 01:01:01,980
technology-related abuse then they refer

1543
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,599
them to us and then that's how we get in

1544
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,859
touch with them and start meeting with

1545
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:06,599
them and talking about them

1546
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,520
and from these experiences we've been

1547
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,000
able to gather a lot of data and conduct

1548
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,099
research based on the experiences

1549
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,780
gleaned from those interactions with

1550
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,420
survivors so we are first and foremost a

1551
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,400
service we first and foremost serve our

1552
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,020
clients whether they want to participate

1553
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,180
in research or not but we do also use

1554
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,799
the information that we get from that to

1555
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,500
take away some broader points

1556
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,280
um

1557
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,960
of course there are some limitations to

1558
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,760
what we to the way that we receive

1559
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,900
referrals

1560
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,460
um and so none of this is intended in

1561
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,619
any way to be

1562
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:40,559
um you know an accurate assessment of

1563
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,760
like this percentage of people

1564
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,319
experience this or this percentage

1565
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:44,520
experience that since we're really

1566
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,079
limited to who we're referred by but it

1567
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,240
does give us some information about how

1568
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,040
technology abuse plays out in these

1569
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,200
situations

1570
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,900
so this was started in 2016 by

1571
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,760
professors Nikki doll and Tom Briston

1572
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,859
part we serve all five boroughs of New

1573
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:00,180
York City

1574
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,000
um and only New York City we do not take

1575
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,980
um survival referrals from survivors who

1576
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,880
are not

1577
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,140
um attached to actually one of our

1578
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,640
partner agencies

1579
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,740
but um over that time we've received

1580
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,900
over 400 referrals to date from the

1581
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,480
local ipb agencies uh more probably

1582
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,799
since the last time I checked on this

1583
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,299
number

1584
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,339
um and we currently have about 20 plus

1585
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:22,140
active volunteers who range in

1586
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,400
backgrounds from being cyber security

1587
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,160
experts technologists at large tech

1588
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,859
companies social workers students in

1589
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:30,420
academics

1590
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,339
um if they this talk in any way inspires

1591
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,839
you to want to come join us we are

1592
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,339
accepting applications for new

1593
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,780
volunteers so feel free to get in touch

1594
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,980
with me about that as well

1595
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,780
um and so during this time in this past

1596
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,720
six years that what I wanted to share

1597
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,160
um was some takeaways from what we've

1598
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,319
actually seen in that time in with the

1599
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,780
survivors that were spoken to

1600
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,780
so Tech abuse and practice uh I wanted

1601
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,700
to start with this taxonomy of attacks

1602
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,200
because I think it's useful for kind of

1603
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,299
giving a sense of all the different ways

1604
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,640
that technology can be used to harass um

1605
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,500
or abuse um survivors of intimate

1606
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,660
partner violence and so this is based

1607
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,059
off of the 2018 analysis in which we

1608
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:11,280
identified four types of attacks I've

1609
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,020
since updated it to add my kind of

1610
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,700
fifths that's like a little bit like we

1611
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,140
can work on the wording but I think that

1612
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,640
it was necessary to capture something

1613
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,500
else that we've been seeing

1614
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,900
um that we didn't see in 2018

1615
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,480
so these are the five types of attacks

1616
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,760
that we see or how we kind of categorize

1617
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,980
them in this taxonomy account and device

1618
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,260
compromise ownership-based attacks

1619
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,900
exposure private information harassment

1620
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,480
and Technology assisted monitoring

1621
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,539
and um I'm going to run through some

1622
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:40,980
examples of what those look like in

1623
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,900
practice so

1624
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,539
for account and device compromise this

1625
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:46,980
usually means monitoring digital

1626
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,480
communication like being logged into

1627
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,920
someone's emails and reading their

1628
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,859
emails or text messages it can also mean

1629
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:55,020
using the account access that you have

1630
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,119
to delete someone's accounts which is

1631
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,579
particularly difficult when it's an

1632
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:00,599
account that someone uses for their

1633
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,520
business so I've seen people's

1634
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,400
um like the pages that they use for

1635
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,619
um like a business that they run being

1636
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:09,180
taken down from Instagram and deleted

1637
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,980
permanently

1638
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,539
um it's also really common for people to

1639
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:14,160
use this access to delete evidence of

1640
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,319
abuse so for example text messages

1641
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,240
photos

1642
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,299
um that documented the abuse history or

1643
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:22,920
for the abuser to impersonate the

1644
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,119
Survivor

1645
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,799
uh there's a lot of other things that

1646
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,119
people can do with this that kind of

1647
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,460
access but that's just some of them

1648
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,440
and then ownership-based attacks are

1649
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,599
distinct because these are attacks where

1650
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,640
the abusers the person who owns the

1651
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,500
account and that creates unique problems

1652
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,420
for the survivors so this might be

1653
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,880
something like being the person who owns

1654
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,619
the phone contract that their phone is

1655
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,839
on or haven't been the person who set up

1656
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,819
their device or account and then using

1657
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:49,260
that access to shut off their air

1658
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,880
conditioning in the summer or shut off

1659
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,220
their internet access

1660
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,440
um they can also be the person who set

1661
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,119
up someone's accounts for social

1662
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,900
benefits such as Medicare or our housing

1663
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,640
applications and then use that to lock

1664
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,799
the Survivor out of um

1665
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,839
out of accessing those benefits that

1666
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,319
they needed

1667
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,059
so exposure of private information I

1668
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:13,500
think the number one thing that comes to

1669
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,299
mind with that is non-consensual

1670
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:17,880
intimate images this is also known as

1671
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,640
revenge porn or sex flirtation

1672
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,160
um so this is sharing intimate images

1673
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,359
this can be

1674
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,400
um both things that are overtly sexual

1675
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,960
in nature but it can also be content

1676
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,660
context dependent so someone for example

1677
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,299
practices viewing for their religion to

1678
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:35,220
share photos of someone who is unveiled

1679
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,319
can both incite harassment from their

1680
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:38,760
own Community

1681
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,260
um or social

1682
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,119
um social ostracization

1683
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,980
uh so this is really something that's a

1684
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,599
very broad term which is why we use this

1685
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,400
phrase of intimate images instead of

1686
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,319
anything that's more

1687
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:51,660
overtly related

1688
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,359
to sexualizing someone

1689
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,220
um other examples of exposing private

1690
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,260
information are coerced spending like

1691
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,359
like sharing doxing someone basically

1692
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,160
and sending um their credit card

1693
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,140
information out to

1694
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,200
um

1695
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,859
people that shouldn't have that

1696
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:10,980
information or identity theft or

1697
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,359
otherwise just using blackmail and

1698
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,799
extortion based on the private

1699
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,539
information that you have so that could

1700
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,039
also be outing someone who's part of the

1701
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,240
lgbtq plus community

1702
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:22,200
um harassment again like we saw in the

1703
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,119
example like spoofing phone calls

1704
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:26,160
sending mass emails

1705
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,799
um posting summons information on public

1706
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,319
websites that people harass them we have

1707
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,180
had clients do this from like sharing

1708
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,940
someone's private information in prison

1709
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,619
um and having the people who are in the

1710
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,460
prison harass the the Survivor

1711
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,140
and then finally the last category that

1712
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,420
I kind of added to talk about was

1713
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,539
technology assisted monitoring and um I

1714
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,339
don't yet have a great term for this but

1715
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,539
it's something that's come up a lot more

1716
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:54,359
which is abusers installing AV devices

1717
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:57,359
that they own in public spaces or like

1718
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,819
to capture the survivor's entrance to

1719
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,579
their building to their driveway or by

1720
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:04,559
adding a personal tracker such as a tile

1721
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,920
or an air tag to cars pets children it's

1722
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,539
also iot

1723
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,760
um is not really captured by any of the

1724
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,039
other categories and iot is something

1725
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:16,380
where even in the same home if someone

1726
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,480
has like a smart bulb that automatically

1727
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,940
turns on when someone is in a certain

1728
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,740
area of the home and the abuser is the

1729
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,059
one who owns that then they can use that

1730
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,579
to kind of monitor where the Survivor or

1731
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:30,680
victim is within their own space

1732
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,799
um

1733
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:33,119
so

1734
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,160
that's kind of like this high level view

1735
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,900
of all of the different ways that we

1736
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,720
have seen technology being used to

1737
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,240
um um harm survivors of intimate partner

1738
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,220
violence but I just wanted to note that

1739
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,440
in practice this taxonomy it's useful

1740
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,780
for that categorization but abusers can

1741
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,400
use multiple Avenues of attacks to

1742
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,380
achieve the same results right so it's

1743
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,119
not like they just pick one way of doing

1744
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,460
this and then stick to that so for

1745
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,559
example to find a victim's location

1746
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,119
which is one of the biggest concerns

1747
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:02,460
that we see you can use an app like find

1748
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,619
my phone and and

1749
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:07,200
um add yourself to that and through that

1750
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,480
account compromise get their location or

1751
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,039
you can get proximal information from

1752
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,960
logging into their calendar or their

1753
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,400
emails where they would email people

1754
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,219
about where they'll be

1755
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,080
um it can be through ownership-based

1756
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,759
attacks like having access being the

1757
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,198
owner for phone plan can give you a lot

1758
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,759
of information about where a cell phone

1759
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,460
is and what it's doing

1760
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,839
um and you can also use for example

1761
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,460
personal trackers you can use a

1762
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,259
combination of these methods to get

1763
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:34,439
varying levels of detail about someone's

1764
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:36,738
location

1765
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,679
um and I also just wanted to touch on

1766
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:41,939
spyware because I think this is

1767
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,279
something that comes up a lot uh Ceta

1768
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,779
originally actually began as a spyware

1769
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:47,880
field study um they were just trying to

1770
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,560
I joke sometimes that they were just

1771
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,299
trying to conduct this failed study on

1772
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:53,460
you know how often is fiber actually

1773
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,960
being used in practice and then they

1774
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,339
accidentally started an essential

1775
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:59,040
service which was Ceta

1776
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,380
um ironically spyware is not something

1777
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,779
that we see that often at SATA this

1778
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,179
could just be an like an artifact of the

1779
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:08,339
fact that we are seeing clients who have

1780
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:09,839
been referred to us through the mayor's

1781
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,759
office Family Justice centers

1782
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,040
um and so that they tend to have already

1783
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,620
been separated from from the abuser if

1784
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,179
they were in a romantic or domestic

1785
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:19,859
relationship

1786
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:21,540
um and so again this might be a

1787
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,399
limitation of our referrals but we find

1788
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,620
that dual used apps are more common and

1789
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,238
what I mean by a dual youth app is that

1790
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:28,439
it's that that's an app that has a

1791
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,060
legitimate purpose that Survivor might

1792
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,500
have installed themselves and wanted to

1793
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,540
use like find my phone but it's being

1794
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,460
repurposed by the abuser without the

1795
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,120
survivor's consent or knowledge to

1796
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,920
um gather information about them or

1797
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,020
otherwise harm them

1798
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,238
and as just a more General point from

1799
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:46,859
that Tech abuse here is usually not

1800
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,198
technically sophisticated we are not

1801
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,939
often seeing people whose phones have

1802
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:52,560
been rooted we are not seeing like some

1803
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,299
cloning we're not seeing Pegasus

1804
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:55,860
deadlifted on people's phones although

1805
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,239
people are often concerned about those

1806
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,520
things when they hear them

1807
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,739
um it's usually just these very kind of

1808
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,719
pedestrian ways that people are are

1809
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:06,120
using to harm people but sometimes with

1810
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,920
the devastating effect

1811
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,239
so um

1812
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,340
um I also wanted to briefly talk about

1813
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,679
how we respond to technology abuse so I

1814
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,179
think one question that might come up is

1815
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:19,739
like how is this any different from like

1816
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,260
the Genius bar or is you know some kind

1817
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,000
of customer support who responds to this

1818
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,920
like why do we need a clinic that's

1819
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,840
specifically talking about tech abusive

1820
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,940
Tech experts

1821
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,500
um and it's that our our intervention

1822
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,780
protocols need to be sensitive to the

1823
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,580
context that our the survivors and

1824
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,980
clients that we see are in right so for

1825
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,880
one thing

1826
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,860
um if we are dealing with account

1827
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,960
compromise uh one of the first step that

1828
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,880
we would want to take is to identify who

1829
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,980
has access to the account before we do

1830
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,960
anything else right so we don't just

1831
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,580
want to jump in and change a password or

1832
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,140
say get a new phone you first want to

1833
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,300
see who has access to that phone or to

1834
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,280
that account and document it in case the

1835
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,320
Survivor wants to use that as evidence

1836
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,179
in an order of protection later

1837
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:02,100
then we also just want to take stock of

1838
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,440
like what is visible to the abuser what

1839
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,760
is visible to the person that you are

1840
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,620
concerned about because there's a big

1841
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,540
possibility of abuse escalation and we

1842
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,860
actually have seen this quite often

1843
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,260
where if someone had access to someone's

1844
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,000
iCloud or someone's Gmail and then we

1845
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,280
take away that access the abuser can

1846
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,679
escalate their their abuse um so they

1847
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,659
might show up at the victim's house or

1848
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,360
they might um start calling them or

1849
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,460
start calling their family members

1850
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,719
um or it might actually lead to an

1851
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:29,760
instance of physical violence so we need

1852
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,280
to notify the Survivor like hey the

1853
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,560
person who you are concerned about might

1854
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,179
be able to see that you are taking some

1855
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:37,679
actions to take back control of your

1856
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,500
technology and do you have a plan to be

1857
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,080
safe like do you have a safety plan um

1858
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,699
with your social worker or with your

1859
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:47,219
caseworker that can help make sure that

1860
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,260
you aren't

1861
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,580
coming into further harm

1862
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,199
I think another thing that's important

1863
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,940
is to be aware of like these this kind

1864
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,320
of cascade

1865
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,860
um

1866
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,420
or like kind of this waterfall effect

1867
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,760
where every user might be logged into a

1868
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,679
recovery account or have two Factor

1869
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,080
authentication set up on the account but

1870
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,900
not necessarily be logged in so we want

1871
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,640
to be able to trace the way that all of

1872
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,560
these accounts are interlocking with

1873
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,360
each other and what information they're

1874
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,860
giving to each other before we start

1875
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,840
taking any actions or start suggesting

1876
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,880
any actions actually

1877
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,800
because the second part of this is that

1878
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,060
we want to have a trauma-informed

1879
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,800
perspective that these are people who

1880
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,840
have had a lot of agency taken away from

1881
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,239
them and we're trying to empower them

1882
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:28,679
right like we're trying to educate them

1883
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,000
about what is going on with their

1884
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,100
technology what steps that they can take

1885
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,960
and letting them choose how they want to

1886
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,360
respond to any signs of abuse or

1887
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,400
compromise that they see and sometimes

1888
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,280
they might choose a response that

1889
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,020
doesn't make sense to us or that we

1890
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,520
don't think is the best option and but

1891
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,900
we want to respect that and make them

1892
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,080
feel comfortable doing what they um

1893
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,020
feel is right for their situation

1894
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,280
um and we also don't want to just say

1895
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,540
like we'll just don't use technology

1896
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,100
because it's such a critical part of our

1897
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,840
everyday life that we want them to feel

1898
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,460
empowered to use that normally the way

1899
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,260
that other people do

1900
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,880
um to the best of their ability while

1901
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,280
still remaining safe

1902
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,380
so that's kind of an overview of just

1903
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,140
how what we do in practice what kinds of

1904
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,880
Technology we used to be see and how we

1905
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,560
respond to it

1906
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,540
based off of what the clients that we've

1907
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,100
seen and the my time

1908
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,140
um and actually responding to these

1909
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,560
issues I've run into some open issues

1910
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,480
where we see these problems repeatedly

1911
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,179
but we don't have a solution for them so

1912
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:28,500
it's a lot of times where we're just

1913
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,900
kind of you know saying there's nothing

1914
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,699
that we can do I'm sorry and so I wanted

1915
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,199
to share with those issues were because

1916
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,699
I think that's something that might be

1917
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,520
most interesting for this group

1918
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,760
so I would say that the first issue is

1919
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,800
um what would an ipv aware protocol look

1920
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,239
like for devices that collect and

1921
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,940
transmit sensitive or personal data and

1922
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,040
how do we have a design process that

1923
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,480
includes marginalized and vulnerable

1924
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,520
populations from the start

1925
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,960
and to kind of make this a little bit

1926
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,820
more concrete I think a good case study

1927
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,640
here is air tags so air tags were

1928
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,140
released and these are some example

1929
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,520
headlines of how they were almost

1930
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,460
immediately used to for stalking and for

1931
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,260
criminal usage

1932
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,420
um a woman who found that an airtag had

1933
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,920
been attached to the underside of her

1934
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,320
wheel well at a bar from someone that

1935
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,820
she didn't know

1936
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,440
um two people from the TV show The

1937
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,320
Bachelor who were one of them ended up

1938
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,920
attacking attaching an air tag to one of

1939
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,540
the contestants cars after the show

1940
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,040
ended

1941
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,140
and just pointing out that there have

1942
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,940
been like at least 50 cases that we know

1943
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,800
of in eight months in this short period

1944
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,199
that was reported to the news

1945
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:37,500
um of non-consensual talking

1946
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,440
and personal trackers were originally

1947
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,300
designed with the only threat models

1948
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,640
being you know I'm the person who owns

1949
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,020
this item and I've lost it like the

1950
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,179
threat model is me losing it the other

1951
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,679
threat model was like the strangers

1952
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,900
stole something from me and I need to

1953
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,820
know where it is so it was never really

1954
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,320
looking at it from this perspective of

1955
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,880
how they could be abused or how they

1956
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,820
could be used to to Target you know the

1957
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,900
vulnerable

1958
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,480
and this hadn't really been as huge of

1959
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,159
an issue until Apple released their air

1960
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,080
tag because suddenly the network for

1961
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,760
personal trackers just became huge

1962
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,440
because of the way that they work their

1963
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,060
ability to pair with any Apple device

1964
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,400
just made it so that you could attach to

1965
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,780
their tag and track anyone almost

1966
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,820
anywhere in the United States pretty

1967
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,920
easily and that had immediate

1968
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,560
consequences for vulnerable populations

1969
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,360
so I guess the question here is like how

1970
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,219
do we balance this original purpose of

1971
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:28,260
not losing items and Theft Protection

1972
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,199
with ibv and stalking threats right so

1973
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,300
one example is having cross-platform

1974
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,760
detection right now air tags will alert

1975
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,500
any Apple user that they are being

1976
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,840
followed by an air tag

1977
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,040
um you will not get that alert if you

1978
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,960
have an Android or if you have like a

1979
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,420
non-ios device

1980
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,699
um so can we have develop a standard

1981
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:49,679
where whenever you have these kinds of

1982
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,239
trackers that are being released that

1983
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,219
across all platforms and across all

1984
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:54,900
electronic devices that you would

1985
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,060
receive that type of notification and

1986
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,320
what would that look like and what would

1987
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,480
we need to have that

1988
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,640
I think another thing to think about is

1989
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,380
can there be like a neutral third party

1990
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,420
who holds suspicious tracker data so if

1991
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,400
an Airtel is moving with someone without

1992
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,320
their consent that that would trigger a

1993
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,420
notification instead of sending that

1994
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,100
directly back to the person who set up

1995
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,659
the air tag can we hold that information

1996
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,820
so that if it's needed to track down

1997
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,380
something that has been stolen or lost

1998
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,120
it can be accessed but it's not

1999
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,620
necessarily immediately sending

2000
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,300
real-time information about where that

2001
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,280
is right

2002
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,920
so these are just some possibilities

2003
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,300
um and I think it's a good example of

2004
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,400
like when we release new technology that

2005
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,280
is building a new network how do we take

2006
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,080
into account these processes how do we

2007
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,699
design them with

2008
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,040
um a process that centers the vulnerable

2009
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,960
and marginalized population populations

2010
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,880
from the start and sort of finding it

2011
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,600
out after the fact

2012
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,760
um a second question that I've touched

2013
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,380
on a little bit is how do we how do we

2014
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,719
approach ID verification in an ipv

2015
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,000
context and that's specifically where

2016
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,460
ipv survivors may never have had control

2017
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,280
of their own devices or may have lost

2018
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,199
control of their devices and not been

2019
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,300
able to recover their accounts so the

2020
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,520
way identity verification works is it

2021
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,900
generally assumes that someone who would

2022
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,980
be trying to recover the account

2023
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,360
wouldn't have any personal information

2024
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,000
about the part about the actual owner

2025
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,100
and that's just not true in ipb and it

2026
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,400
is we see this abused so so often at

2027
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,739
Ceta so I think a big case study here is

2028
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,659
Android data recovery and this is one of

2029
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:26,400
the hardest things for us to see and one

2030
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,320
of the hardest situations that like

2031
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,420
emotionally I think that I have seen

2032
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,400
when I've worked with clients so three

2033
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,500
times in the past month alone how we had

2034
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,120
clients present with the same scenario

2035
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,280
where they owned an Android phone and

2036
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,900
the phone plan was owned by the abuser

2037
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,159
so they don't have access to the call

2038
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,920
logs or the text message history their

2039
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,300
data was backed up to a Google drive

2040
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,100
because it was an Android phone

2041
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,780
and the abuser just locked them out of

2042
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,699
the Google account deleted all of the

2043
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,380
evidence and then factory reset the

2044
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,820
phone remotely

2045
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,520
so all of a sudden

2046
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,980
um the clients just had zero access to

2047
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,239
any of the information that had ever

2048
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,580
been used on that phone right and so you

2049
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,900
know we've seen clients who have been in

2050
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,699
a relationship with someone for 10 years

2051
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:08,640
for 35 years and they don't have a

2052
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,500
single trace of digital evidence that

2053
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,840
they ever contacted or had any

2054
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,940
relationship with the person who was

2055
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,640
abusing them and because they don't have

2056
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,140
that information they don't have any

2057
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,580
evidence that can get them in order for

2058
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,620
order protection saying do not contact

2059
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,840
me through electronic means which is

2060
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,120
just absolutely wild so

2061
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,980
you know how do we do identity

2062
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,219
verification and account recovery

2063
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:35,100
um and do we like is it is it ethical in

2064
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,900
some ways for data to be backed up to a

2065
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,980
Google Drive if there is no account

2066
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,540
recovery process for Google Drive

2067
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,980
accounts which is currently the

2068
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,519
situation

2069
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,980
um and then finally this is the last one

2070
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,320
which is how do applications communicate

2071
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,179
across varying levels of technology and

2072
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:53,219
data literacy so a lot of our clients

2073
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:54,780
are not really good with technology is

2074
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,940
how they'll describe themselves

2075
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,920
um but what features can we build into

2076
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,360
applications and this is more of an

2077
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,340
application Level problem that allows

2078
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,780
users to have ownership over their own

2079
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,699
data especially when it's needed for

2080
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,460
evidentiary or safety purposes

2081
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,500
so some case studies here there's like

2082
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,060
the safety checks that was just released

2083
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,100
by Apple in their most recent

2084
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:14,640
um

2085
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,560
in their most recent announcement about

2086
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,440
updates to iOS where

2087
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,239
um Google also has the notifications

2088
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:22,679
like you should turn on two-factor

2089
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,060
authentication

2090
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,159
um and Facebook has some safety check

2091
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,140
features as well and what they do is

2092
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,580
they walk users through their delicate

2093
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,780
privacy settings and this really

2094
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,280
user-friendly Manner and that's been

2095
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,840
really helpful for clients to be able to

2096
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,340
take control of their own data and be

2097
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,960
aware of what's being shared right like

2098
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,699
to have some kind of dashboard of how

2099
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:41,100
their data is actively being shared on

2100
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,600
that platform

2101
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,040
um they could be better by providing

2102
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,659
abuse escalation warnings like I

2103
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,760
mentioned or resources to local ipv

2104
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,199
agencies but right now I think that

2105
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,520
they're a really good step in the right

2106
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,440
direction

2107
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,920
um a kind of a bad example of of data

2108
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,420
requests here are that a lot of

2109
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,280
applications will dump critical user

2110
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,739
data or time data and share it in this

2111
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:03,719
really unfriendly way and like this Json

2112
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,600
filed up so Google will keep a 28-day

2113
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,520
history of logins

2114
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,920
um Apple will not keep any history of

2115
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,900
logins to an iCloud so once someone has

2116
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,280
been booted off an account you can't

2117
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,760
ever prove that they used to have access

2118
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,920
um and both Facebook Instagram and

2119
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,659
Tinder all have these like Json file

2120
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,060
dubs where you request your own data and

2121
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,500
then we have to kind of process that

2122
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,239
data for our clients because they're

2123
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,679
trying to find out like what date

2124
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:30,179
someone followed them on Instagram to

2125
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:31,739
prove that someone violated an order of

2126
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,360
protection

2127
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,580
so ways that that data can be released

2128
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,840
and something that's like more

2129
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,719
technically more friendly to those with

2130
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:42,980
less technical literacy

2131
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:46,560
so I'll leave that with um those three

2132
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,600
um on those three questions

2133
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,239
um because I'm not sure how much time is

2134
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:53,040
left and I wanted to leave some time for

2135
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,139
questions we do have other efforts at

2136
01:20:55,139 --> 01:20:56,820
Ceta that I didn't talk about so far

2137
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,739
which includes like some laws that were

2138
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,020
advocated for that protected survivors

2139
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,659
at the state and federal level

2140
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,460
um we do advocate for funding and

2141
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,860
guidance for other Tech clinics

2142
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,239
um and we do have

2143
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,699
um obviously research that we publish

2144
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,620
um so there is like a whole Corpus of

2145
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,020
research that's publicly available

2146
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,340
um and feel free to ask me about any of

2147
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,920
those if you're curious

2148
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,719
um and I'll leave these contacts and

2149
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:23,940
resources that while people are asking

2150
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,860
anything they have this is my email if

2151
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,360
you have like other questions about like

2152
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,980
volunteering with us or if you wanted to

2153
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,500
share our volunteer applications with

2154
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,699
any groups that you know if that would

2155
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:34,080
be interested

2156
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,360
um and our website and Twitter account

2157
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:44,100
Alana thanks so much this has been

2158
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,360
really really interesting as I knew it

2159
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,980
would be we've already got a cue started

2160
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,440
but a reminder to folks in the room join

2161
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,620
the queue from your phone go ahead Tom

2162
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,480
hi Lana that was really really wonderful

2163
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,800
thank you very much

2164
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,580
um I had a a personal experience of

2165
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,080
something very similar along these lines

2166
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,820
actually in the past and it was it was

2167
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,800
related to an iCloud

2168
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,659
um account and it wasn't

2169
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:09,360
um abuse against myself per se but I was

2170
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,800
a sort of a third party in this

2171
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,060
situation and it was it was quite

2172
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,739
frustrating to find that there wasn't

2173
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:18,360
I don't think we have an open equivalent

2174
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,639
like this in the United Kingdom

2175
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,020
um I think that there is an equivalent

2176
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,340
certainly with the police forces but it

2177
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,620
isn't very visible if that makes sense

2178
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,060
so there's there doesn't appear to be

2179
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,260
something

2180
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,280
um similarly as well my employer BT

2181
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,900
um we're currently having an interesting

2182
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,760
conversation at the moment around the

2183
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,580
rights of miners uh those under 18

2184
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,540
children

2185
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,639
um and I think this is um something I'm

2186
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:42,780
going to want to share with them because

2187
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,159
I think it's very very important and

2188
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,739
relevant question wise I was

2189
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:49,800
hoping I don't know I think I think I

2190
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,659
know the answer to this but

2191
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:54,000
um have you been able to have any

2192
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,460
engagement with some of the large

2193
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,120
um

2194
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,100
uh device manufacturers and service

2195
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,960
manufacturers but people like the

2196
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,239
Facebooks the apples the Googles have

2197
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:04,380
you been able to have any engagement

2198
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,199
with them for the purpose of helping

2199
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,880
inform the design of their products in

2200
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,340
the future is there a is there a way in

2201
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,020
which you can

2202
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,880
um maybe they won't listen maybe they

2203
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,440
won't ask but you know is there a way

2204
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,760
that you can

2205
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,840
um

2206
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,699
get in touch with them start you know

2207
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,679
offer some some help in terms of

2208
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:24,360
research that you've you've conducted in

2209
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,120
cases that you've worked on uh it feels

2210
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,060
like it's the sort of thing where

2211
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,679
seat belts were designed with men in

2212
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,080
mind and so seat belts cause more

2213
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,840
complications with women in accidents

2214
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,360
um if we are in that situation where

2215
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,440
they could benefit from the information

2216
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,380
that you've and perhaps Anonymous

2217
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,880
information from from the cases that

2218
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,560
you've worked on it may help actually

2219
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,000
inform some of the designs that they

2220
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,920
make but you know they should be

2221
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,020
reaching out to folks like you I think

2222
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,659
but have have you had any of that at all

2223
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:58,199
or is it something that we can help with

2224
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,719
yeah I think so we have had some of

2225
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,400
those interactions I'm happy to say and

2226
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,280
we do really try to you know not view

2227
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,440
them as adversaries or antagonists but

2228
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,520
try and do them as like Community

2229
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,100
stakeholders and partners in this so I

2230
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,679
did recently speak um like so

2231
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,120
um meta does a good job of like

2232
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,219
soliciting input from

2233
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,320
um both aceta um also the national

2234
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,239
network to end domestic violence in the

2235
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:23,880
UK there's Refuge which um offers a lot

2236
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,739
of support in this area and they do have

2237
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:27,600
a technology safety team although it's

2238
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,040
quite small I think it's like three

2239
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,320
people and I know them all

2240
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,360
um and so they do solicit feedback about

2241
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,120
this and you know there have been

2242
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,920
um I'm not sure what the disclosure

2243
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,179
agreements for some of them are so I

2244
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:40,260
won't list either ones but there have

2245
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,179
been other companies that have solicited

2246
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,340
input from us when designing new

2247
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,860
features particularly around language

2248
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,320
um and around the kind of again that

2249
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,179
protocol of documenting evidence first

2250
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:52,860
and then you know a warning of

2251
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,320
escalation kind of thing

2252
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,480
so yeah I think

2253
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,580
there's some positive news there I think

2254
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,780
the downside is that there are some

2255
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,100
times where we have just pointed out

2256
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,600
these things over and over again like we

2257
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,040
have pointed out many times that Android

2258
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,440
data recovery is devastating to people

2259
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,900
like to think about the fact that like

2260
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,800
you can be in a relationship with

2261
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,780
someone for 35 years and they can erase

2262
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,520
every single trace of digital evidence

2263
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,800
that you were ever together emotionally

2264
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,719
is really hard but then legally it

2265
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,480
creates a lot of complications as well

2266
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,520
um and it's something where you know we

2267
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,280
may not like sometimes it kind of seems

2268
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,260
like people are aware or like that some

2269
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,820
people at those places are aware but

2270
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,500
they just are kind of choosing to maybe

2271
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,540
there's not as much pressure around

2272
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,159
doing it the same way that pressure was

2273
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,800
created around air tags right so I think

2274
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,179
that that's part of that thing of trust

2275
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:40,980
trying to design these processes that

2276
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,560
you know include stakeholders from

2277
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,320
various communities from the start right

2278
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,639
but yeah I think it's a really great

2279
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:49,139
point and I'm sorry to hear about your

2280
01:25:49,139 --> 01:25:50,820
experience I know like even as being a

2281
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,380
third party to something it's a really

2282
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,300
hard thing to witness it can be like

2283
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,820
just you know a very emotionally

2284
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:57,780
difficult

2285
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,239
I I think it's as you point out I think

2286
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,159
it's actually scarily common

2287
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,739
um yeah yeah I look forward to it not

2288
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:05,580
being

2289
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,840
um thank you for all of your work in

2290
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,400
this and I like the suggestion that you

2291
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,020
had on the protocol

2292
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,300
um for air tags to be sharing that

2293
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,679
information with other phones I think

2294
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,600
that was actually extremely valid

2295
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,760
um and and I hope someone is able to

2296
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,560
work on it I wish I were thank you for

2297
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,659
your help

2298
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:25,080
thank you I put myself in the queue to

2299
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,600
again thank you for a great talk I was

2300
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,400
really looking forward to this

2301
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,659
conversation and entering the group

2302
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:32,460
because for a long time Sophia and I

2303
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,739
have been planning to write some of this

2304
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:35,760
down

2305
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,300
um because it is mostly centered on what

2306
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,920
many have already raised which is the

2307
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,320
threat model is incomplete and it isn't

2308
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,120
I mean yes I think this is a very

2309
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,860
strongest use case it's maybe the

2310
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,560
simplest most straightforward expression

2311
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,380
of it but it also happens kind of as a

2312
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,900
local the local threat can be others it

2313
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,120
could be also your boss potentially if

2314
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,920
you know it's really like do you does

2315
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,480
somebody have access to your device does

2316
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,620
somebody have access to your Wi-Fi

2317
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,719
network does somebody have a social

2318
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,639
relationship to you all those things you

2319
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:07,100
very clearly laid out in the beginning

2320
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,719
is what comprises that fret model it can

2321
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:11,580
also be parents and children right

2322
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:14,159
there's there's some you know view that

2323
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,219
teenagers should you know be protected

2324
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:18,840
in that way from from things like that

2325
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,060
so that's really great and having I

2326
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,860
think the things you you've written I'm

2327
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:25,440
sure in terms of your guidance

2328
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,179
that you have produced as your clinic

2329
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:30,239
could be a really useful starting point

2330
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,719
for us to also unpack we it's really

2331
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:35,100
interesting that you mentioned you

2332
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,620
started out to study spyware because

2333
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,080
that's also where I think Sophia and I

2334
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,400
started when we were thinking about this

2335
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,320
like what if we looked at the spyware

2336
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,940
and tried to figure out how it works and

2337
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,159
then wrote that down and then you noted

2338
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:48,840
like actually that's not even the

2339
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,340
biggest part of the problem so that's

2340
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,860
really useful that I didn't

2341
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,420
um I didn't realize

2342
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,400
um and another one that I wanted to

2343
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,900
highlight that I think also is

2344
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,360
incomplete or we don't care about enough

2345
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:04,139
is data loss as an attack

2346
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:05,940
um so deleting things I mean we know

2347
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,620
like ransomware and things like that is

2348
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,480
is an attack but I think we don't often

2349
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,980
have

2350
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,320
um the right uh sort of imagination

2351
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,360
around how that can happen

2352
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,060
um quite quite more often than it than

2353
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,780
it um than we document or think about

2354
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:25,080
um and then I think another thing that

2355
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,239
uh really liked in terms of solution

2356
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:30,060
space that you mentioned was around

2357
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,219
maybe because this is an effort an

2358
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,100
empowering users more is how we can

2359
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,900
think about more mechanisms of

2360
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:41,159
presenting data to everyone all users

2361
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,020
that can help

2362
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,900
like in an innocuous way so everybody

2363
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,420
gets this sort of data presentation

2364
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,739
um to empower people to know more about

2365
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:51,360
what's going on so one really easy

2366
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,520
example that is now very pervasive is

2367
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,760
like tells you the last time anyone

2368
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,320
logged into your account and from what

2369
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,179
device like that didn't always used to

2370
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:03,179
be so ubiquitous but it is now I think a

2371
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:05,760
lot more of those kinds of things where

2372
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,960
you can look

2373
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,360
from your device or from your account to

2374
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,420
see certain kinds of activity

2375
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,100
um that would be enabled for every kind

2376
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,960
of account

2377
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,760
um those are like examples of like

2378
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,739
proactive

2379
01:29:19,739 --> 01:29:21,300
you know measures that could really help

2380
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,320
so

2381
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,940
um thanks so much for your work on this

2382
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,860
Alana I wonder if you

2383
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,699
um

2384
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:28,020
um I don't know if you were here earlier

2385
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,880
for some of the discussion we had around

2386
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,060
what hrpc does but if at all you had

2387
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,440
feedback on whether or not you think

2388
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,420
some of this like that you see the

2389
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,040
technical community that we have here

2390
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,860
been useful in furthering your work I

2391
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,179
wonder if you have thoughts on that

2392
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,460
thank you Mallory yeah and I just wanted

2393
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,260
to kind of like just a little bit of

2394
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,520
responding to some of the things that

2395
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,440
you mentioned one of them about spyware

2396
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,520
showing up

2397
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,739
um I like I do want to repeat again like

2398
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,900
you know um we have research talking

2399
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,179
about like forums of abusers and how

2400
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:02,040
they go and seek out spyware and how

2401
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,600
they like kind of

2402
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,460
um use them so those things are being

2403
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,380
used I will say that like it's probably

2404
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,440
more common if people are if our clients

2405
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,120
were predominantly in shelters which

2406
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,380
they're not they usually have already

2407
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,520
separated

2408
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,960
so

2409
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,699
um like there's a higher fiber risk when

2410
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:18,960
someone has physical abscess to your

2411
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,639
device because typically they do need

2412
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,139
that access in order to install the

2413
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:24,120
spyware and so for a lot of our clients

2414
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,560
that's not necessarily they might have

2415
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,820
changed out their device or something

2416
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,800
but they are still logged into the same

2417
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,120
account so I don't necessarily want to

2418
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,440
downplay it in that way but just say

2419
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,699
like it's not something that we see

2420
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:36,179
because of this um group here but

2421
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:38,940
um yeah I think um those those login

2422
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,860
messages are really really useful and I

2423
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,300
think just generally letting people know

2424
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,400
like for any data that is sensitive

2425
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,540
that's being transmitted over the

2426
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,460
internet to let people know like um

2427
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,080
information about who has logged into it

2428
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,179
who has Xena and who has had access to

2429
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,400
it is a transparency that we should just

2430
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,960
kind of set as a standard on the

2431
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,639
internet I unfortunately was not here

2432
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,260
for the earlier part about what hrpc

2433
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,699
does because I had a meeting that I

2434
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,739
couldn't get out of but

2435
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:03,120
um I would love to hear other people's

2436
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,800
suggestions based on like what I've said

2437
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,360
and what you know that

2438
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,159
um that you all do that you think would

2439
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,699
be relevant

2440
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:18,300
and I see um Sophia join the queue so

2441
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,920
maybe she'll have thoughts on that too

2442
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,840
um but yeah go ahead Adrian

2443
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,800
uh so uh uh great uh presentation Lana

2444
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,460
uh I also am involved in advocacy

2445
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,500
particularly with respect to digital

2446
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:36,239
identity as a dual use technology

2447
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,780
um and my question to you

2448
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:42,600
is specific to how do you see the role

2449
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,340
of Biometrics in the digital identity

2450
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:49,800
protocols and related protocols related

2451
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,219
to digital identity because

2452
01:31:52,219 --> 01:31:57,719
is it an opportunity to improve the you

2453
01:31:57,719 --> 01:31:59,699
know to to shift the balance of the Dual

2454
01:31:59,699 --> 01:32:02,940
use Technologies in favor of the good uh

2455
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,340
or is it a risk in your opinion based on

2456
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:08,460
your experience thank you

2457
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,260
yeah that is a great question

2458
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,460
um I was wondering if someone would ask

2459
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,960
about Biometrics and I'm glad that you

2460
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,100
did

2461
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,960
um so it is something that we have seen

2462
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,239
Biometrics being abused

2463
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,159
um and the clinic and I think the really

2464
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,280
important thing with Biometrics and with

2465
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,719
any other tool that's being used for

2466
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,580
identity verification is to think about

2467
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,800
it from this model of like what happens

2468
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,699
in in situations that are not just that

2469
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,880
distant attacker right because I think

2470
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,440
the danger of Biometrics like the

2471
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,940
positive thing about Biometrics is that

2472
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,500
if that person doesn't have access to

2473
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,719
your physical devices then you know it's

2474
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,900
a really like solid security mechanism

2475
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,239
but if they do still have access to it

2476
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,420
right and what happens is that they can

2477
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,460
very easily be abused if we see them as

2478
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,800
the end-all be-all identity verification

2479
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,020
like if we say well you know your

2480
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,000
thumbprint was used for this so you must

2481
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,580
have authorized this when it is very

2482
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,020
possible that someone who is being

2483
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,060
coerced or is an abusive relationship

2484
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,000
could be threatened into using their own

2485
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,699
Biometrics to verify something right so

2486
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:13,199
I think that we want to still see those

2487
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,360
limitations of it before viewing it as

2488
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,219
like an end-all be-all like if you if

2489
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:18,600
you had done this then this must have

2490
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,980
been

2491
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,840
um like proof that you consented to this

2492
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,239
and to be able to have a little bit of

2493
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,040
flexibility in understanding how

2494
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,260
coercion can play a role

2495
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:31,320
in being in in basically forcing people

2496
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,540
to use their Biometrics to verify things

2497
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,159
that they didn't want to so again I

2498
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:36,239
think it's one of those neutral tools

2499
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:37,260
where we just need to think about it

2500
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,280
from these multiple different

2501
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,020
perspectives of different threat models

2502
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:42,300
and how they could be abused and how

2503
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,980
they could be used for security as well

2504
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:46,739
right because we see this a lot with

2505
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:48,719
um like even two-factor authentication

2506
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,820
where when you're trying to recover

2507
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,620
account people will say well you you

2508
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,719
know like your two-factor authentication

2509
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,940
is set to this phone so you know you

2510
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,139
don't have access to this phone so it

2511
01:33:58,139 --> 01:33:59,699
must not be you right like that is as

2512
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:01,500
good as it gets so

2513
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,139
um and then in reality it was like the

2514
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,120
phone number is attached to a contract

2515
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,560
that was owed by the abuser and you

2516
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,460
can't remove that phone from the

2517
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,659
contract because of the way that the

2518
01:34:09,659 --> 01:34:10,739
laws work

2519
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:12,780
so does that kind of answer does that

2520
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,460
make sense

2521
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:19,760
uh yes yes thank you

2522
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,159
hello um I'm Siobhan uh I work with

2523
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:31,800
Sophia at Brave browser um thanks for

2524
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,020
your talk I came in a little bit late

2525
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,639
um apologies it was a conflicting

2526
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:37,440
session so maybe this was already

2527
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,400
covered

2528
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,679
um but I just wanted to say that um

2529
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:43,260
typically in browsers and user agents we

2530
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:46,500
don't consider the browser as like part

2531
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,080
of the like like if someone has access

2532
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,179
to your to your browser then we think

2533
01:34:51,179 --> 01:34:53,340
that oh it's game over but it seems like

2534
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,980
there's a real like you know

2535
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,860
perspective that we are missing where um

2536
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:02,639
we could be doing stuff to um to make

2537
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,219
sure that uh so you know we don't just

2538
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:07,800
like keep this out of our threat model

2539
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,239
um so something that I guess Sophia and

2540
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,040
I were talking about was

2541
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,440
um injecting random history over the

2542
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,960
last you know last two hours so that an

2543
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,940
attacker who has access to the machine

2544
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:20,940
doesn't see that someone visit someone

2545
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:22,920
went to a you know like a helpline

2546
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,199
website or something like that

2547
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,060
um so and this you know this would not

2548
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,860
be too hard to come up with like some

2549
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,420
fuzzing around this or some kind of

2550
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,920
protection so

2551
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,980
um I think if um it'd be great if you

2552
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,960
can come give a talk at Ray research or

2553
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,119
if you have any suggestions around some

2554
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,380
technical measures that could be done

2555
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,060
that would be helpful

2556
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,940
um at the browser level to help protect

2557
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,040
victims I think that'll be really useful

2558
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,500
thanks oh absolutely yeah thank you so

2559
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,880
much for your question and for bringing

2560
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,199
that up because I think that there are

2561
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:53,699
definitely a couple things that browsers

2562
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:55,800
can do one of them like you said I don't

2563
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,139
know if you had um heard about this but

2564
01:35:58,139 --> 01:35:59,460
Google recently announced that they

2565
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,940
would no longer show in location history

2566
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,900
visits to

2567
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,760
um abortion clinics due to the overturn

2568
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,860
of Roe v Wade and I think that there's a

2569
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,880
similar thing that can happen with

2570
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,679
browsers to just like block out like

2571
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,619
submit your history going to

2572
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:15,420
um you know the websites that are for

2573
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:18,060
that are like owned by

2574
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,800
um non-profits and agencies that are

2575
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,020
targeted towards ipv so right now we

2576
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,400
tend to have these quick exit buttons

2577
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,840
but to just not show it up in someone's

2578
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,179
browser history at all I think is like a

2579
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:29,520
really important and helpful feature to

2580
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,320
build in and then the other thing that

2581
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,119
comes to mind is the kind of built-in

2582
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:34,679
password management that comes with a

2583
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:36,659
lot of browsers specifically with like

2584
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:38,520
wallets and financial accounts and

2585
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,260
passwords where people don't intend to

2586
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:43,020
understand how those work or know how to

2587
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,580
limit it and we've seen some really

2588
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:46,139
devastating effects of like Financial

2589
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:47,639
abuse coming from

2590
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:49,380
um people taking advantage of like the

2591
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,239
browser caching those passwords and

2592
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:53,219
credit card information which is really

2593
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:54,719
useful people love it and they want to

2594
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,400
use it but like I think to kind of just

2595
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,860
make sure that you know that again that

2596
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,480
intimate partner threat model is being

2597
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,619
considered

2598
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:02,159
um

2599
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,080
for being able to take back control over

2600
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,860
those accounts

2601
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,540
and feel free to reach out to me about

2602
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,880
the um the brave part of it I know that

2603
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,139
we have some great volunteers who have

2604
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:14,280
worked at Brave

2605
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,920
um so always happy to see that

2606
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,460
representation

2607
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:26,219
okay I'll just go

2608
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,380
um yes so thank you very much Lana for

2609
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,540
this I was wanting to retreat what the

2610
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,880
Mallory was saying uh but definitely we

2611
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,679
need then a draft to actually address

2612
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,080
this as a threat model that is very real

2613
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,060
and maybe one of the most powerful

2614
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,219
attackers that the internet or networks

2615
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:44,000
can never see this kind of attacker and

2616
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,320
unfortunately and sadly it is not even

2617
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,000
considered most of the times when you're

2618
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,580
actually designing protocol devices and

2619
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,440
also want to reiterate that she won of

2620
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,000
the invitation but we can follow that

2621
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,440
offline

2622
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,060
um but one of the things that I do have

2623
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,520
been thinking about and maybe this maybe

2624
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,860
somehow we could share this visibility

2625
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:04,260
is that recently there has been a lot of

2626
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,699
thoughts from

2627
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:07,920
different governments or law enforcement

2628
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,739
agencies to actually break end-to-end

2629
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:13,080
encryption systems because they lack

2630
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,739
data to properly protect sometimes they

2631
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:18,000
target

2632
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,060
um children or also women well what I

2633
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,320
know from my experience with also

2634
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,880
working with women's group in Latin

2635
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,920
America law enforcement law enforcement

2636
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,619
agencies has most of the time a lot of

2637
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:30,659
data already and most of the times they

2638
01:38:30,659 --> 01:38:33,540
don't believe any kind of Survivor or

2639
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,580
ongoing abuse that is happening to them

2640
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,139
so maybe they could share that

2641
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:39,239
visibility that indeed they have the

2642
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,100
data and sometimes they choose to ignore

2643
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,800
it and that perhaps they just don't need

2644
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,080
more access to that data because the one

2645
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,159
that they have it they're already

2646
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:48,900
ignoring I don't know if that will be

2647
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,880
useful or some kind of visibility should

2648
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,440
be put there

2649
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,380
I don't know what you think

2650
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,420
yeah I mean just to kind of clarify

2651
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,159
you're talking about the idea that like

2652
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:01,080
law enforcement often already has this

2653
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,460
information and they're just choosing

2654
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,980
they're just ignoring it yeah we see a

2655
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,040
lot of that invisibilization of

2656
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,699
um

2657
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:13,560
of Technology as proof and I think that

2658
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,060
um it really depends on the area that

2659
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,679
you're in but I think that one thing

2660
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:19,440
that was thought about a lot is how we

2661
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,020
can serve as technical experts as expert

2662
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,659
Witnesses for people to force them to

2663
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,219
take it seriously so that there is

2664
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:28,080
somewhere that's speaking with authority

2665
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,360
because you know like like was said in

2666
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,739
the last talk people do listen to us

2667
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,360
more than they listen to like a lot of

2668
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,100
social workers or a lot of other

2669
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,159
agencies to say like you know based off

2670
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,380
of what we've seen like we can say with

2671
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,880
you know some Authority with the

2672
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,679
authority that we have that this has

2673
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,440
happened right and to at least have that

2674
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,320
like a testimonial that is coming from

2675
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,800
our expert backgrounds and sharing that

2676
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,380
and conferring that list survivors to

2677
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:56,460
help them

2678
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,260
um gain some legitimacy although again

2679
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,239
like you said like it's it's only as

2680
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:01,739
powerful as people are willing to listen

2681
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:03,239
but I think that there is something that

2682
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:04,560
we can do to use like our special

2683
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,840
Vantage points as computer scientists

2684
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,119
and technologists to help me maybe

2685
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:12,119
encourage people to listen

2686
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:13,920
definitely something that we've seen and

2687
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,420
I think also educating law enforcement

2688
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,820
on on

2689
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:20,100
this problem as well the ones that are

2690
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,900
willing to help I mean we've seen the

2691
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,760
New York City Police Department have a

2692
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,940
DV task force that very accurately was

2693
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,619
telling our clients how to screen for AV

2694
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:30,119
devices that might have been left in

2695
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:31,920
their homes and letting them know like

2696
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,480
any AV device is going to be

2697
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,159
transmitting things over the Internet or

2698
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:36,659
through Bluetooth so you want to check

2699
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:38,280
your Bluetooth and you want to change

2700
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,380
your internet and knock anything off of

2701
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:41,639
the internet that might have been

2702
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:44,820
transmitting data about you so yeah I

2703
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,800
but I I definitely sympathize with that

2704
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,659
problem and also I just wanted to say

2705
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:50,820
thank you so much for inviting us to

2706
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,619
come speak and always happy to talk

2707
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:55,619
about this with with um people of this

2708
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:57,920
background

2709
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,619
fantastic thanks again really excellent

2710
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:03,840
work we hope to see you and your

2711
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,000
colleagues back at some point

2712
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,100
um be good to start some some research

2713
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,480
and documentation with you I think

2714
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,520
there's a lot of interest in this

2715
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,920
um updating fret models

2716
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,239
um

2717
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:17,820
tax taxonomy on threats and that sort of

2718
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,960
thing would be really great to have you

2719
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,980
contribute

2720
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,780
thanks Alana

2721
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:24,179
thank you so much

2722
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:27,659
okay so I'm gonna go back to my slides

2723
01:41:27,659 --> 01:41:28,800
um

2724
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,139
because now we're going to shift into

2725
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:32,639
talking about

2726
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:33,420
um

2727
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:37,400
some of the group documents

2728
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,560
I think first off I don't know I don't

2729
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,880
know if we have anyone actually

2730
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,820
presenting on

2731
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:49,560
um draft guidelines

2732
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,280
that's not the slide

2733
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,679
that's the slide um as an author of

2734
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,380
draft guidelines I'd be interested to

2735
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:02,280
hear from the irtf chair where the

2736
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,760
review is on that and where the uh where

2737
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,260
the progress is what we can do how we

2738
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,719
can help and

2739
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:11,400
because I think it has been like this

2740
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,059
since last meeting

2741
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:21,199
um yeah I mean

2742
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:23,639
stressed what's changed significantly

2743
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,100
recently so

2744
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,100
um

2745
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,260
I I mean that the issue I think I've had

2746
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:37,380
sort of two two sets of comments I think

2747
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,520
I've

2748
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,800
um raised in in the past about this

2749
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,880
draft

2750
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,719
um

2751
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,400
and

2752
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,199
um

2753
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:49,860
one is that it it seems

2754
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,920
um

2755
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:55,380
it talks about uh human rights based on

2756
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:57,659
this un declaration and doesn't doesn't

2757
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:01,139
seem to relate it concretely to

2758
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:04,080
um you know how that's been reflected in

2759
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,300
particular sort of national guidance and

2760
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,679
so on

2761
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:11,159
um and as a result it seemed seemed to

2762
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:13,440
me when I was reading it to be very the

2763
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,500
discussion was very abstract

2764
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,239
um and similarly getting into the the

2765
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,060
technical recommendations

2766
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:23,580
the the sort of quite abstract set of

2767
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,980
Human Rights it mentions then leads to

2768
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,480
some quite abstract discussion about

2769
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,580
technical recommendations

2770
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:30,179
um

2771
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:32,219
and that that doesn't seem to be a lot

2772
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:35,159
of nuance in those recommendations as a

2773
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:36,480
result

2774
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,440
um

2775
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,060
and

2776
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:40,500
um I mean I think this is an issue I've

2777
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,659
raised a couple of times before it seems

2778
01:43:42,659 --> 01:43:44,880
like it would benefit from being you

2779
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,320
know focusing the discussion a little

2780
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,780
more concretely on you know examples of

2781
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:50,699
how those rights are reflected in

2782
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:53,340
particular regions and that that would

2783
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,679
then let you give examples of concrete

2784
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,300
problems which you could then concretely

2785
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,460
give examples of how

2786
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,080
you know when discussing the particular

2787
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:03,360
technical issues you know here is a

2788
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,520
specific example which that that then

2789
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,679
applies to to make it more concrete and

2790
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,159
more relatable to engineers

2791
01:44:11,159 --> 01:44:13,020
so I think that that I'm not going to

2792
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,520
explain that well but that's that's sort

2793
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,080
of where I'm coming coming from with

2794
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:16,980
this

2795
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,860
thanks so much Colin we've heard uh that

2796
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,420
from you in the last session and we

2797
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,179
created a new version and a response to

2798
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:26,900
that since then

2799
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,920
um the dash 13 version I don't believe

2800
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,719
had any changes to address that

2801
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,440
uh how did I miss a version

2802
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,619
that might because I think we responded

2803
01:44:43,619 --> 01:44:45,119
to this

2804
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:49,580
so and it has been since in your review

2805
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,500
um I think there was I mean we discussed

2806
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,300
this at the last meeting and I think

2807
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,940
that you you suggested that you don't

2808
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:59,340
believe that's in scope uh I'm not sure

2809
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,199
I agree

2810
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,460
um

2811
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:06,420
so um okay then uh this is an excellent

2812
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,540
moment to discuss because the examples

2813
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,860
have been extensively done in RFC 8280

2814
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:15,719
and if we're gonna discuss particular

2815
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:17,940
examples which we've done in the example

2816
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,600
sections but go there in different

2817
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:23,219
jurisdictions then we get into the

2818
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:25,500
implementation area of human rights in

2819
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,380
local jurisdictions and this is about

2820
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,659
the implementation of Human Rights not

2821
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:32,820
about the implementation of local laws

2822
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:37,159
in local implementations right

2823
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:39,000
[Music]

2824
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
um

2825
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:44,719
I'm I'm not quite sure I understand

2826
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,520
what you're getting at

2827
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,500
oh I was in the queue to explain a

2828
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,780
little bit further so the a lot of this

2829
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:54,719
discussion happened on the list

2830
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,699
um and I think the idea was actually

2831
01:45:56,699 --> 01:45:59,340
that that is really useful that having

2832
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,340
something that maps onto local laws

2833
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:04,800
would be something that protocol

2834
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,080
developers strongly want

2835
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,239
um but unfortunately that's a very

2836
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,219
different document and probably wouldn't

2837
01:46:11,219 --> 01:46:14,580
be as useful as a sort of compendium of

2838
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:17,699
all of the countries that have laws that

2839
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:20,280
relate to this but rather would be a

2840
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,260
document that explained maybe an

2841
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,900
approach to do so so

2842
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:27,179
um again like taking a sort of higher

2843
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,340
level view that

2844
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,920
um yes definitely checking with uh local

2845
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,340
laws and trying to swear policy with

2846
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,280
um you know technical design but also uh

2847
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,980
you know technical policy right

2848
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,840
um like there would be guidance around

2849
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,000
how what's the best practice to do that

2850
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,980
and I think there's actually probably a

2851
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,199
fair amount of writing that exists on

2852
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,480
that already would be kind of I think

2853
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,400
the the task of this new document would

2854
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,739
be to you know distill what that

2855
01:46:55,739 --> 01:46:59,159
literature says and present it just in

2856
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:01,619
the case of you know Internet Protocol

2857
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:04,199
design and deployment

2858
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:06,960
um but that this that better that that

2859
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,780
work actually would be non-trivial and

2860
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:12,420
would probably lead to and best be

2861
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:14,639
described in its on it in a standalone

2862
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,980
document that's separate from

2863
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,600
um the

2864
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,179
um the guidelines document around the

2865
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:23,400
international human rights framework

2866
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,920
um and yes as Neil's noted in the chat

2867
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,040
um Sandra was interested in that work

2868
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,719
um but I think ultimately agreed like it

2869
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:32,820
shouldn't necessarily be in this

2870
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,679
document because it would kind of not

2871
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:37,080
well Express

2872
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,480
that I mean

2873
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:43,619
sure I I think that that's not what I'm

2874
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:45,900
if I'm understanding you right that's

2875
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,239
not what I'm asking for so perhaps I

2876
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,719
haven't explained what what I what my

2877
01:47:51,719 --> 01:47:54,659
concern is here

2878
01:47:54,659 --> 01:47:56,839
um

2879
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,179
I I think this the sort of two

2880
01:48:00,179 --> 01:48:02,100
aspects to my concern about this stuff

2881
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,540
one is the sort of technical

2882
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,040
recommendations and one is the

2883
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,600
positioning

2884
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,440
um

2885
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:11,100
and the technical recommendations are

2886
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,960
probably the the easier one to address

2887
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,960
in in that they seem in a lot of cases

2888
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:20,699
to to lack nuance and like depth

2889
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,580
and I don't think there's there's so

2890
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,500
much anything wrong with them it's just

2891
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,480
that they could off they could often say

2892
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,440
more

2893
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:31,560
and I think a lot of the reasons why

2894
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,600
it's hard to say more in the context of

2895
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,460
the documents is that it it doesn't

2896
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:39,119
really give specific examples of what is

2897
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,580
meant by the rights and therefore it's

2898
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:44,400
it's hard to relate that to a specific

2899
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,960
example which of what you know how that

2900
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,820
particular technical issue

2901
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:53,100
affects things so it's difficult to make

2902
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,440
it concrete for for an engine in a way

2903
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,900
that an engineer writing a spec would go

2904
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,600
oh yeah I I see I see see how that's an

2905
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,000
issue and I can then resolve it

2906
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,340
and I think part of the reason for that

2907
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:07,679
stepping back is that it's trying to be

2908
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,560
expressed in this in what seems to me

2909
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,619
are quite abstract way without giving

2910
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:16,199
a concrete description of what you mean

2911
01:49:16,199 --> 01:49:19,800
by those particular human rights and

2912
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,020
you you clearly the authors are coming

2913
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,719
from a particular background of you know

2914
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,159
in a particular jurisdiction with

2915
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,780
particular set of experience and it's

2916
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,060
not to me clear

2917
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,580
how that necessarily relates to the the

2918
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,139
broader experiences everyone is having

2919
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:35,960
so I think documenting

2920
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,159
you're making it a little more concrete

2921
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,598
might make it a bit more useful

2922
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,820
I have to say I'm slightly

2923
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:52,739
surprised by this because I thought we

2924
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:54,719
had responded and I thought it wasn't a

2925
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:55,920
guideline and

2926
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,719
we didn't receive a response so it would

2927
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:01,080
be great to get this also in writing

2928
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:04,519
I also want to know that the office

2929
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:07,560
the last couple of meetings so I I'm

2930
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,300
surprised you say you haven't received a

2931
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,699
response no but we've we've been working

2932
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:14,159
on we've been working to address exactly

2933
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,480
that

2934
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:19,980
and um it it's interesting to see that

2935
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,040
those changes are not recognized as a

2936
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,540
significant change in trying to get

2937
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:26,820
there also the authors come from

2938
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,320
different expertises and different

2939
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,360
jurisdictions with a long-term

2940
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,460
experiences implementing human rights in

2941
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:36,000
different environments and also doing

2942
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,340
human rights refutes of drafts and

2943
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,960
working with people who have doing human

2944
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,719
rights free reviews on draft themselves

2945
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,139
here in the ITF and every Point that's

2946
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,560
brought up has a particular example

2947
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,040
with it so that there are no examples

2948
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:56,460
I find also a bit

2949
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:59,639
um hard to understand but

2950
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:02,880
I'm happy to uh

2951
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,760
have a look at the review

2952
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,500
I don't think I said there are no

2953
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,900
examples I think I said the examples

2954
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:12,960
were they I think I said the technical

2955
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,000
points were vague and that specific

2956
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,099
examples would make some of them more

2957
01:51:17,099 --> 01:51:20,840
concrete and easier to understand

2958
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,940
and I believe I have give them that

2959
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:33,719
feedback in writing several times but I

2960
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:35,940
can find the email and resend it if you

2961
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,900
would find that helpful

2962
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,619
okay we seem to be in a in a versioning

2963
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:46,980
thing whereas I think we have done the

2964
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,260
last revision and I created a new

2965
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,119
version whereas you think you might have

2966
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,040
given the last cast comments on the last

2967
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,139
version and the last responses so let's

2968
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:57,900
work it on our list

2969
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,400
sure

2970
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,500
I mean if it's useful to have a call

2971
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,659
then then we can you know there's some

2972
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:05,400
hypnotic interaction then I'm happy to

2973
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,139
arrange that but

2974
01:52:07,139 --> 01:52:09,960
yeah yeah that would be excellent

2975
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,580
I would also want to join that call

2976
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,619
because and sorry I'm skipping the queue

2977
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:14,820
Adrian but

2978
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:19,440
um the I I also am surprised and I um

2979
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,480
have been trying to follow as closely as

2980
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,980
I can also in the irsg where this

2981
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:28,020
um document had been in your queue Colin

2982
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,300
to make sure that when you know it had

2983
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,099
it was in your queue and I was I was

2984
01:52:32,099 --> 01:52:34,080
able to be about available for questions

2985
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,760
and to follow the process it seemed to

2986
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,260
me that it had it just hadn't been

2987
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:38,280
moving

2988
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,980
um but uh so it's it's on me also as

2989
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,739
chair for not realizing that there were

2990
01:52:43,739 --> 01:52:46,619
pending changes I thought actually that

2991
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:49,920
um the the suggestions had been pretty

2992
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,560
well addressed so I'd love to take this

2993
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,840
offline with the two of you or maybe we

2994
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,460
can also get Gersh about as the

2995
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:59,219
co-author so that we're all on the same

2996
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:01,440
page about what actually has to happen

2997
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,699
with this draft

2998
01:53:02,699 --> 01:53:04,739
um because I'm I'm also with me outside

2999
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:07,940
I had no idea

3000
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:15,179
I was expecting more updates and it

3001
01:53:15,179 --> 01:53:16,679
seems that you you thought the updates

3002
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:19,080
had been done so yeah definitely that

3003
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,940
was also my impression

3004
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,260
so

3005
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,340
um okay

3006
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,800
well I think there's not much else but

3007
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,599
yeah Adrian you were in the queue please

3008
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,159
go ahead

3009
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:32,699
uh yes I I think uh somewhat related to

3010
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:35,159
this point uh though I apologize I

3011
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:37,679
haven't seen these drafts

3012
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,219
um I am specifically interested in uh

3013
01:53:41,219 --> 01:53:44,940
our groups uh uh present uh how we

3014
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:48,119
approach delegation as a human right

3015
01:53:48,119 --> 01:53:51,599
because as I understand it uh delegation

3016
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:54,719
is not ex the right to delegate the

3017
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:56,520
right to choose your doctor or do you

3018
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,980
choose your defense lawyer or to be

3019
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:02,460
represented by an expert or a spouse

3020
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:08,460
um is not explicitly uh in the uh in the

3021
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:11,520
un uh declaration but then we have

3022
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,760
things like the freedom of Association

3023
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,739
which was mentioned explicitly in the

3024
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:20,820
beginning and so in in my work around uh

3025
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:24,420
protocols uh both around ganap and ietf

3026
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:29,760
and a bunch in in other forums uh I I

3027
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,800
find that I need to have a more

3028
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,920
sophisticated understanding of privacy

3029
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,719
considerations from this point of view

3030
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,739
of Delegation and uh that that's kind of

3031
01:54:40,739 --> 01:54:42,840
both a comment and a question if it's an

3032
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,580
appropriate one at this point thank you

3033
01:54:58,679 --> 01:54:59,880
I mean

3034
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,020
um

3035
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,060
thanks Adrian for those comments I don't

3036
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,860
know if others want to respond

3037
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:06,980
um

3038
01:55:14,099 --> 01:55:16,639
um okay

3039
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,860
so I think we're we're off this now

3040
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:25,139
Niels but unless you want to just stay

3041
01:55:25,139 --> 01:55:27,420
on camera we can move to

3042
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,380
um

for sharing the slides thanks all for

3053
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:12,239
the work uh we're here to talk about

3054
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:15,300
draft Association uh next slide please

3055
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,340
we've been working on this together with

3056
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:20,300
Stefan coutures

3057
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:24,480
and Mallory uh it is trying to deliver

3058
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,159
on one expected uh part of the objective

3059
01:56:29,159 --> 01:56:31,199
of the research Group which is

3060
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,920
established the relationship between

3061
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,599
a particular human rights a particular

3062
01:56:36,599 --> 01:56:38,580
freedom of expression and a right

3063
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,460
Association to internet protocols

3064
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,040
uh uh Giselle and I were the original

3065
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:48,060
editors uh Stefan has some taken up an

3066
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:49,920
editorial role and worked on an

3067
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,260
excellent uh

3068
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,380
um literature review

3069
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,540
um then we've been working on a way

3070
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:00,000
forward to define a particular structure

3071
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,800
hence they found a reconducted the

3072
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,360
literature review and identity

3073
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,940
identified their sub questions that we

3074
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:07,860
then subsequently sought to add to

3075
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:11,520
answer through empirical uh examples uh

3076
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,800
that we did by adding case studies I did

3077
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,420
that with Mallory to answer those sub

3078
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:18,659
questions and itf113 Nick Doty became

3079
01:57:18,659 --> 01:57:21,060
the dog Shepherd and conducted a review

3080
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:23,659
next slide please

3081
01:57:23,659 --> 01:57:27,960
that review done by Nick was super

3082
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,239
thorough and resulted in several pull

3083
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:32,580
requests and an email to the list

3084
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:35,760
and uh uh what the draft is now looking

3085
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,920
at is what are the considerations of the

3086
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,139
right to freedom of assembly and the

3087
01:57:40,139 --> 01:57:41,880
right to freedom of Association for

3088
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:44,040
protocol development it contains a

3089
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,780
literature review that results in seven

3090
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:48,000
research sub questions and the sub

3091
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,040
questions are answered with examples or

3092
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,520
cases of ITF protocols

3093
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:55,920
and uh in a restructure where we have a

3094
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,520
a still something to discuss uh whether

3095
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,679
to structured examples from issue

3096
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,380
Centric to protocol Centric and right

3097
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,480
now they're issue Centric because the

3098
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,580
sub questions are as well and then to

3099
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:12,019
the conclusions next slide please

3100
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:17,099
uh uh so since uh 09 uh there have been

3101
01:58:17,099 --> 01:58:19,500
nits there's been lots of copy editing

3102
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,980
going on and uh a lot of deepening

3103
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:27,119
adding references and uh some some then

3104
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,040
what we still now looking at is this

3105
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,619
restructuring should spam and mailing

3106
01:58:31,619 --> 01:58:33,900
list be shown as cases to answer

3107
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:36,060
particular sub questions or should they

3108
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:38,520
be mentioned once but if we do that then

3109
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,020
we might need to restructure the whole

3110
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,000
thing and it's not be consistent through

3111
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,679
the whole document so that that's a bit

3112
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,179
of a can of worms that I don't not

3113
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:47,520
necessarily know how to solve and Nick

3114
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,960
opened some good questions needing

3115
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,780
citations and proposed texts on the hrpc

3116
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:54,780
mailing list but I have sought to

3117
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:56,340
address them all in the latest version

3118
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:58,260
so I'm also curious to hear what you'll

3119
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:01,880
think about that next slide please

3120
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:06,000
and this is the uh the structure where

3121
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,639
it is now so there are the different sub

3122
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:11,460
questions so uh one is about got no

3123
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:14,639
peace about being assembling uh freely

3124
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:17,880
and uh addressing others and the right

3125
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,000
demonstration holistic agency that's

3126
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,520
mentioning mailing list mechanic example

3127
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,980
and in the Civics in cyberspace it's

3128
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,139
also showing mailing lists again so

3129
01:59:28,139 --> 01:59:29,760
right now we're answering based on

3130
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,219
issues and these Technologies are used

3131
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:34,080
in different ways for different examples

3132
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,900
they could also be put together but then

3133
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,300
would then problematize the way that we

3134
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,580
structured the answers now so it's a bit

3135
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:44,219
either or and it's hard to do this to do

3136
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:46,560
it to do both at the same time because

3137
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,900
that would then lead to like a

3138
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,580
demolishing of the structure we've been

3139
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,440
working long and hard at next slide

3140
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,619
please

3141
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:58,879
foreign

3142
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:06,179
actions is establish agreements on the

3143
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:07,679
way forward for the example so the

3144
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:10,080
keeping the structure are changing it a

3145
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,119
proposed a title change because freedom

3146
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:14,460
of Association on the internet was not

3147
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:15,719
very clear that it's actually about

3148
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:19,199
protocols so I worship the title a bit

3149
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,659
to make it very clear so the proposal

3150
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:23,820
for the title change is the human rights

3151
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:26,040
to freedom of Association and assembly

3152
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,280
and internet protocols

3153
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:29,880
um

3154
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,260
uh we call for uh volunteers to review

3155
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:36,239
and and revise even though we've largely

3156
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,340
done a lot of work but other people are

3157
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,780
always welcome to review and make

3158
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:43,619
suggestions and uh looking to hear from

3159
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:46,320
Nick what he thinks about what we did

3160
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,480
with the document and whether it fixed

3161
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,400
the issues we had

3162
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,199
next slide please

3163
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:55,159
I think that was it

3164
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:57,480
yeah because this is a working group

3165
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,280
document we felt like there were some

3166
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:02,040
things we wanted to bring to you all to

3167
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,860
get your feedback on and yeah would love

3168
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:08,400
um folks to jump in the queue

3169
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,760
um Nick if you had feedback now

3170
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,320
if you've had a chance to look at the

3171
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,880
new version I think it just went up this

3172
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,739
week so apologize

3173
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:19,320
for not getting that in sooner

3174
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:21,119
well we did it did get in before the

3175
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:23,699
duck freeze but then meals was so

3176
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:26,099
industrious as always and couldn't help

3177
02:01:26,099 --> 02:01:29,659
to make the rest of the changes

3178
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:34,560
yes thank you um I'll I'll be very brief

3179
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:35,580
um

3180
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:38,460
I I had that question about uh structure

3181
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,920
because I thought it was uh confusing to

3182
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,599
me as a reader about

3183
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:46,020
um uh coming back to those topics but I

3184
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:48,659
do think the issue I I understand better

3185
02:01:48,659 --> 02:01:51,000
now oh we have to do an issue by issue

3186
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,420
and then uh some of the same protocols

3187
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,980
and

3188
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,659
um and and protections are going to come

3189
02:01:57,659 --> 02:01:59,820
up in those different issues so so I

3190
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:02,699
think that makes sense I I might I I

3191
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:04,080
think it's asking for me to do a

3192
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,940
re-review that's reasonable and I might

3193
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:08,400
suggest wording changes work them just

3194
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,380
to help people like me who were confused

3195
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:12,960
but I don't think we need I I think the

3196
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,760
argument for having the structure issued

3197
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,280
by issue that that makes sense to me so

3198
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,380
I I

3199
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,119
that that would be my initial reaction

3200
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:22,560
if other people have a different

3201
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,340
proposal

3202
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,339
happy to hear it

3203
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,980
yeah if we sort of go back to just so

3204
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,719
everybody can see on this structured

3205
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:35,940
question let me go back to where we've

3206
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,980
got

3207
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:40,739
the current structure so the point being

3208
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:42,840
that like yeah on a couple of these

3209
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:44,580
different things we we talk about the

3210
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:46,980
same thing or the same phenomenon from a

3211
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:48,840
tool perspective from a from a protocol

3212
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,340
perspective

3213
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:51,900
um but it's because we're trying to

3214
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:53,760
answer remember these cases and examples

3215
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,760
are trying to answer the previous

3216
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:01,260
section that begs more areas of research

3217
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:03,119
from the literature review so we're

3218
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:05,699
trying to to pull those out more I think

3219
02:03:05,699 --> 02:03:07,500
your comment another structural comment

3220
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,900
you had Nick was just about expanding

3221
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:12,719
them so these these cases and examples

3222
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,480
aren't very robust they don't say very

3223
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,699
much they're short so one thing we could

3224
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:20,159
do is you know actually just try to say

3225
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,659
more

3226
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:25,820
um which I think is a fair point

3227
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,219
um

3228
02:03:29,219 --> 02:03:31,860
yeah I fully agree with this point and

3229
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:33,480
in a new version I saw to expand them

3230
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:37,679
already and embed them deeper in uh

3231
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:39,300
uh connect them closer to the question

3232
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,960
and make the answer super precise after

3233
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,260
the end of every paragraph that ends a

3234
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,619
section

3235
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:52,519
awesome

3236
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,199
are there any thoughts on the title

3237
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,900
change I to me it just makes it clear

3238
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:00,540
it's longer but that's

3239
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:03,079
fine

3240
02:04:06,179 --> 02:04:07,920
okay I'm hearing that's not

3241
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,020
controversial good

3242
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,880
so I think in that case we would really

3243
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,380
just ask

3244
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:15,480
um I think we're overtime but yeah we

3245
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:16,980
would just ask that

3246
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:19,920
um for folks interested we can post this

3247
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,480
to the list obviously we'll post the

3248
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:22,500
notes

3249
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:23,760
um

3250
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,860
yeah we'll get a new version out soon

3251
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,440
and then

3252
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,360
um yeah if Nick you wanted to do a

3253
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,340
re-review uh maybe in before the next

3254
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:34,199
versions out you we could

3255
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:36,780
um go back and either accept your PRS or

3256
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:39,380
do other things

3257
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:41,960
cool

3258
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:44,820
um great I think that that is the in but

3259
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:47,239
we did have aob I believe there may be

3260
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:49,980
folks I know have approached me asked if

3261
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,360
there were there would be time to

3262
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,340
consider new areas of work which is

3263
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:54,840
something we always want to do so while

3264
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,719
we're a bit over time we are over time

3265
02:04:57,719 --> 02:04:59,940
is it not then yeah let's go ahead and

3266
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:01,619
just pause though for a second before we

3267
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,179
close out

3268
02:05:03,179 --> 02:05:05,460
another

3269
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:09,119
anybody want to propose new work or had

3270
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:10,920
other business related to the working

3271
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:13,139
group they wanted to bring up before we

3272
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:15,320
close

3273
02:05:23,219 --> 02:05:25,699
okay

3274
02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:28,619
I'm not seeing anybody in the room I'm

3275

to do new and interesting and very very

3281
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:46,380
