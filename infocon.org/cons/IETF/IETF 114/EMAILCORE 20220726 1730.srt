1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,960
and on that note

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,320
you're here in the ml core

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,119
and let's get started we haven't now uh

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
um i initially thought we'll finish

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,199
early but i suspect there are actually

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,119
several discussions that might require a

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,119
bit of more

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,400
time so

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
um

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
i thought we'll try to stay on top of it

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
and kick us you know if we're not doing

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
it quickly enough

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
right with that

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
i'm alexi thought this

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,399
sitting next to me

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,760
i assume you all seen note well um

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
i think pretty much everybody here is a

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
long time participant but this is just a

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,280
quick refresher

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,760
not well kind of contact be nice to each

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
other

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,959
and again be nice to each other

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
um

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,680
we have no taking is braun thank you

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
braun

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
uh we only have one set of slides which

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,039
is chess lights

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
just a quick reminder if you're in the

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
room please use masks when you talk to

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
microphone don't take them off uh

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
obviously doesn't apply to remote people

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,880
lucky people

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,199
um

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,280
quick recap of the agenda um

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
hopefully there is no agenda bashing

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
there are two uh

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
items for smtp spec

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
uh the first one about four clauses kind

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
of smtp slash applicability statement

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
but

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
um and then uh we would like to get

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,720
closure on a registration policy

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
yes john

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
this is a

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
a question rather than just a certain

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,799
agenda i know

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
but do you want to spend a few minutes

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
discussing the uh

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
the issue which should not versus must

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
not with 550 codes that's been on the

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
email list

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
oh the one that brought on the mailing

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
list

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
yeah

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
shall we do it at the end if we have

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
time

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
okay

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,879
good point if

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,000
somebody

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
i i just don't want it i don't want to

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
twist those cracks by accident otherwise

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
i don't care

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
okay uh

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
can you remind us at the end

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,280
if we don't run out if there is an end i

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
will certainly i try to remind you

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
okay thank you john

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
so we have a fair amount of tickets for

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
applicability statement

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
actually uh while reviewing them i think

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
a lot of them can get close so at least

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
we can

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,040
see on uh on the mailing list saying

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
look this is now ready to be closed

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,680
please voice your opinion and um

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
i don't think a lot of them will take a

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
lot of time

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
obviously none of the decisions here are

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
final they will be brought in

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
to the mailing list but

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,280
would be nice to get indication on this

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,958
um

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
so that's the rest of the tickets and

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
then

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,879
um

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,680
starting on with the main body of the

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,720
work

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,760
[Music]

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,560
this is uh very quick i don't really

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
want to

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
talk much about this

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,720
uh

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
not free passed away in may

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,159
i think there will be something in the

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,599
plenary

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,799
tomorrow about this uh a lot of us

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
knew ned and

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
i think his council would have been very

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,959
helpful in

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,920
in this room but uh

101
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,958
all right

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,239
okay

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
so um

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
starting with the foreclose and receive

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
header fields um

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,918
i looked at the ticket i nearly closed

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,120
it i

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
i sent john uh you know

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
quick message saying well uh i think we

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
need to do this tweak and then he said

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
no no you know i think we need to talk

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
about this so this is four slides from

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
john and john you you you want to

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,479
present them

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,599
and then we'll have a discussion

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
um the only thing i will add is actually

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,479
um

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,080
i will for this discussion i will be as

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,639
a participant not as a chair because i

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,639
might have a stronger opinion so i will

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
ask thoughts to

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
um arbitrate and make sure that uh

123
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
judge consensus

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
go john

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,960
uh okay i i i posted a uh

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
a moderately long noted list

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
uh earlier in the week and a uh

128
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
an internet draft which

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
uh

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,199
discusses this at the same time

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,720
um

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
uh i i hope and assume that everybody

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,199
has read both of them

134
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
uh so this is intended more as a quick

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
review than i say

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
uh complete analysis

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
um the question when we start messing

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
with

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
received clauses optional z clause

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,039
including four

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,199
uh is these interests has been seriously

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
underdefined

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
since the beginning and we've been

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
picking at them in little ways but uh

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
but not necessarily getting it right or

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
changing them

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
so the question which

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
i was proud to ask when i started

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
looking at this

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
in the current text of 5321 disc

151
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
uh was first of all go back and look at

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,680
the question what the four clause is for

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
and 50 and 821 doesn't say a word about

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,199
it it provides some syntax indicates an

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
optional field and the syntax points to

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
a path which since we eliminated pads is

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
now basically a mailbox

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
uh but it just gives the mailbox name

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
syntax

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,039
and like all components of trace fields

161
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,280
and i hope this is clear enough in the

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
current document but if it is that we've

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
got another issue the primary intended

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,759
use is debugging the assumption was

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
never that users were going to

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
look at these fields unless they

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
had questions or got into trouble

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
um

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
so the value associated with four is

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,199
generally assuming a mailbox

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
of the intended recipient

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
um but again we don't really

173
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,280
say that very quickly uh and if we did

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
we would have trouble with what

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
intended recipient means which is what

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,919
the current debate is all about in a way

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
so it's never been clear what to do with

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,039
multiple receipt commands

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,840
uh

180
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
clause is only going to be used once per

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
received field

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
uh and uh

183
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
and as we have more recently discussed

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,800
it could easily disclose in information

185
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
intended to be private and we've talked

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,759
about pcp bcc mailboxes but that's not

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
actually the only choice

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
next slide

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,880
so

190
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
in the current text we've got a general

191
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
warning about accidental information

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
disclosure especially for sites and

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
special circumstances we're not going to

194
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
dividing special circumstances

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
and we advise against providing for when

196
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
there's more than one recipient address

197
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,919
i.e water speed command and the

198
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,919
particular statement there is badly

199
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,319
written and should be cleaned up to be

200
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,440
retained

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
and for the badly written part you can

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
you could flog the editor except

203
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
unfortunately revolt

204
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,919
um

205
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,440
if our goal is prevent disclosure

206
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
potentially sensitive information a

207
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
bunch of other cases having to do with

208
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,280
the fact that we

209
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
allow

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
our mpas to transit a great deal of

211
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
uh flexibility about

212
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
uncombining and recombining messages as

213
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
we suggest them on combining

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
um

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
we're very very vague about when that's

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,639
possible we don't

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,199
force it we don't prohibit it

218
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
and we may need to rethink this entirely

219
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
when it should be provided and at what

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
stages rather than just providing a

221
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
quick test patch

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,598
next slide

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,360
so

224
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
obvious solutions uh borrowing these

225
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,599
things in the order which they appear in

226
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,120
that internet draft

227
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
hard to conclude for it's just too

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
dangerous we need to get rid of it

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
uh allow it only a message submission

230
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
time because the

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
submission system including both any

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
submission servers in the mqa

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
are the only ones who really know what

234
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
the intended recipient is what should be

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
kept private and what shouldn't

236
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
uh or we decide we don't care about

237
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
those other these other cases fix the

238
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
bad sentence and move on

239
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,880
uh next slide

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
pause with you now

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
um

242
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,399
if we decide to stay with where we are

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,800
to fix the sentence the bad sentences

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
here on the screen alexis

245
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
improved version

246
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,640
after a few iterations is at the bottom

247
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
of the screen and that's where we are

248
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
right now

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
okay and i noticed you accumulated a

250
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,680
large queue

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,070
very

252

[Music]

253
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,399
this is barry lieber

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,920
so i think it's not sufficient to do the

255
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,440
multi-recipients thing because even with

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
a single recipient forwarding the

257
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
message can cause all sorts of exposure

258
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
uh okay todd can you back up or

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
whoever's controlling the slides can you

260
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
back up a slide

261
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,120
yeah so um i i primarily support 1.1 i

262
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
think we should deprecate it the only

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
concern i have

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
is whether that violates our minimal

265
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
changes rule

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
um but i think i think saying that you

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
should not include it in new messages

268
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
but it's still going to appear in uh in

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
older implementations might be

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
sufficient but we should at least do one

271
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
of those varieties of one either 1.1 or

272
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
1.2 that's my opinion a quick comment

273
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
the uh

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
the minimum changes rule

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
is is definitely a question

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
but the the answer to a different

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,959
question

278
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
is that you're explicitly allowed to

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,320
deprecate things which had which

280
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,760
experientially haven't worked out in

281
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
moving to both standards so it's it's

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,519
our rule it's a problem and it's not

283
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,000
about global warming

284
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
okay then i will say but my my vote is

285
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,319
for 1.1

286
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,440
alexi okay so um

287
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
i do have a descending opinion here and

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,839
i might be in minority we'll see we'll

289
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,040
see about that

290
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,839
uh first

291
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,200
um i did quick search on what existing

292
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,399
mtas do so i checked uh i saw their own

293
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,000
implementation and i checked uh

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
exam

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,480
um

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
both on emit four if there is a single

297
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
recipient

298
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,680
so uh which kind of

299
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,959
confirms my theory of how this is

300
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,800
supposed to work you know whether it was

301
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
how it was intended i don't know because

302
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
i wasn't around at the time but this is

303
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
my perception of how

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
i would like you know i think it should

305
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,440
work

306
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
so um

307
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
the second thing is um

308
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,360
we did actually have a request at work

309
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
where uh

310
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
sometimes it's useful to have indicator

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,600
whether you uh to occ recipient right so

312
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
email client shows whether you're two is

313
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,560
your recipient

314
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
and there is a similar request for

315
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
knowing whether

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
you are you're receiving it as a 2 occ

317
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
mailing list

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
in this case you know um

319
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
four can potentially if for uh if a

320
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
message with a single recipient goes to

321
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
a mailing list

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
it gets expanded it can get four mailing

323
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
list address added

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
and then later on you can figure out

325
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
that you actually got this because of

326
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
the mailing list so i find some utility

327
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,639
in this

328
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,800
um

329
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
the third comment is as far as i'm

330
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,240
concerned uh mta's i've seen

331
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
don't make the mistake of leaking

332
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
information they only emit four if there

333
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
is a single recipient

334
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
which also means if

335
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
i mean it's up to ntas to decide they

336
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,160
can split the message into multiple

337
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
transactions

338
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
at which point they are separate

339
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
messages

340
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
separate transactions with a single

341
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
recipient and then they can still emit

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
it whether they do or don't i don't know

just to clarify alexis you've made a

345
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
very strong argument for inserting the

346
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
four at the um

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
descending end

348
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
um and i think that's fine but it brings

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
us rapidly direction of option two on

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
the slide

351
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
um the complicated situations all arise

352
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,399
in

353
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
shuffling and reshuffling as barry

354
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
pointed out forwarding

355
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
uh and uh

356
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,839
and as you pointed out what we do with

357
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,839
list expansion or

358
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,399
sending to a list that gets a recipient

359
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
name after a while and uh the only

360
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,720
option i'm opposed to here is weakening

361
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
the rule the mtas are uh are expected to

362
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,240
poke around in previous headers in order

363
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
to be able to do next

364
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
can i just play it so yeah um i

365
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
basically kind of leaning toward more of

366
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
two or three options

367
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
and i think your option two is actually

368
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
not sufficient i think mta should be

369
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,240
still allowed to do that basically

370
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
well that raises some other questions

371
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
which are beaten to death in the

372
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
internet correct uh hi uh this is uh

373
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
victor de covney uh also i guess number

374
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,839
two on the postfix project uh also only

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
adds for

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,240
when there's a single recipient

377
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
i should note that we're talking about a

378
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
trace header

379
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
uh that happens on entry into the mail

380
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,920
system

381
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
so

382
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
at each hop

383
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
we're recording

384
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
what we received from the

385
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
previous smtp talker

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,079
and if that smtp talker sent us one

387
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
recipient that's when we had that one

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
unique recipient that we received at

389
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
that hop

390
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
two is definitely just fundamentally

391
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
flawed

392
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
that's not

393
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,920
not a good option

394
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
strongly vote for three

395
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,199
also lots of use cases where

396
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
sufficiently knowledgeable users

397
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,800
in fact find the four information in the

398
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,720
in the trace headers and postmasters

399
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,839
likewise

400
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
find it quite useful

401
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
uh when i complain about spam i often

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
want to know which of my thousands of

403
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
email addresses i received the spam for

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
the spam does not disclose that in the

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
two rcc headers

406
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
but i see it in the four

407
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,399
and i want it there

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,360
and um in any case whatever the draft

409
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
ultimately says i predict that postsix

410
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,199
will make no changes uh in the space

411
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,199
you can shout up and down but it will be

412
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
three forever

413
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
uh uh the language can be clarified to

414
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,759
warn some hypothetical mta that gets

415
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,120
this wrong i don't know of eddie

416
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
thank you and i would like to remind

417
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,320
everybody in the room you still

418
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
everybody in the room still please add

419
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,040
themselves to the queue for

420
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
hi it's pete resnick um i am

421
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,600
strongly strongly encouraging us to go

422
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
for number three

423
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,199
i think deprecating it is a mistake for

424
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,839
many of the reasons that

425
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,639
uh that victor brought up

426
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
with a single address it's quite useful

427
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
information

428
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
the fact of the matter is this is

429
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,240
deployed

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,839
as number three for

431
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,600
almost all systems

432
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
and

433
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
given our

434
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,759
charter we should not be trying to make

435
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
a new deprecation at this point we want

436
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
to put something in the as about it we

437
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
want to write a new document that's fine

438
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
let's stick with number three and just

439
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
do it that way

440
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,920
john levine i'm actually going to agree

441
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
with victor but use different words and

442
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
my preference is what i would call three

443
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
minus minus which is this

444
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,359
this entire this entire discussion reeks

445
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
of hubris we have no idea all the way if

446
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,959
the people are going to root their email

447
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
so what i would say is simply note that

448
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
anything in the four clause like the

449
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
rest of the received header is visible

450
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
to any some any subsequent party that

451
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,000
handles or receives the message and if

452
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,039
that's a

453
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
and that's a security issue you should

454
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
you should keep it in mind before adding

455
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
the clause and stop there because i

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
don't know what else i can say that

457
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
wouldn't it wouldn't have

458
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
endless exceptions

459
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
barry lee but again i wanted to respond

460
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,160
to mostly alexei but also some of the

461
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
rest that

462
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
there's no doubt that it's that it's

463
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
useful for some people

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
if it's there uh i want to remind people

465
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,080
that it's often not there you you cannot

466
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
rely on it

467
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,720
um

468
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
so given what other people have said

469
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
about three i'm okay if we decide in

470
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
three that that in 53 21 bits we go with

471
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,080
three

472
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
but we also put something in the as

473
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
saying um that we're basically

474
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
basically deprecating it or advising

475
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
against using it because of all of the

476
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
exposures

477
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
i find that the privacy implications are

478
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
more or are stronger to me than the

479
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
usefulness of it and i would rather be

480
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,919
very strong about avoiding using it for

481
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,840
that reason thanks

482
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
i'm going to limit discussion on this to

483
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
two more minutes braun europe and then

484
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
pete

485
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
and then daniel

486
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
yeah i'm going to say that as someone

487
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
who works

488
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,280
reading email headers a lot it's very

489
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
useful to me it might not be useful to

490
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,440
you barry but for a lot of people it

491
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,880
really is useful

492
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
for things um and if you're scrubbing

493
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
mail to remove things being forwarded on

494
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
you have to scrub lots of places anyway

495
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
it can also be a

496
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
received four header there's lots of

497
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,919
other things can one are being added at

498
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,840
each hop if you want to be really clean

499
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,679
against stuff being seen through you're

500
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,760
gonna have to filter out a lot more than

501
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
just this header

502
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
um i also am very much in favor of three

503
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,120
make the text clear that it can leak if

504
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
it gets forwarded on and think about it

505
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
and that's it

506
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
and this is pete i honestly don't

507
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,919
understand the serious privacy

508
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,400
implications of the single

509
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
recipient

510
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
introduction of the four

511
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
if it was

512
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
sent to me i received it and i forward

513
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,160
it what i forward is my decision it is

514
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,799
now out of smtp's hands

515
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,760
and if i need to clean up a message then

516
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
i need to clean up a message

517
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
that's not a protocol privacy issue and

518
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
i don't think it belongs in this

519
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
document

520
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
daniel van gilmer i'll be quick uh also

521
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,880
speaking in favor of three i believe um

522
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,760
i

523
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,039
uh so

524
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,480
i think that there are multiple people

525
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
in this room who have strong opinions

526
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
about how one should scrub email and i

527
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
think that was worth doing as a separate

528
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
project

529
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
uh in terms of removing uh potentially

530
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,280
leaking

531
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
things and that would be worth noting

532
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
that here i also wanted to note that

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,159
when we just talk about deprecating it i

534
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,360
don't think that's actually particularly

535
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
useful because there's deprecating

536
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
reliance on it and there's deprecating

537
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
inclusion of it and those are two

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
distinct things and i think it's a

539
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
mistake to just randomly say we

540
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
deprecate this without being clear which

541
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
side we're talking about deprecating i

542
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,320
think the simplest thing is to say here

543
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
are the risks

544
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
and work actively on a scrubbing draft

545
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
separately

546
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
thank you

547
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
i believe in the room here we've landed

548
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
on consensus on three

549
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,200
any dispute on that

550
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
no all right move on

551
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,480
it raises a separate question

552
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,559
which is the difference but as you tell

553
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
me you go off and fix text which is the

554
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,360
difference between three and three minus

555
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,799
minus

556
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,799
uh under three we

557
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,440
tune the existing language a little bit

558
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,360
and then go forward

559
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
uh

560
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
under three minus minus for which i have

561
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,080
some sympathy

562
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
we

563
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
don't address we tear the bad sentence

564
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
out and replace it with nothing because

565
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
there's already language in the document

566
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,039
the employers see the

567
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,039
uh see that id

568
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
uh that talks a little bit about this

569
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,080
and

570
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
language about whether or not people

571
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
should rely on it and whether whether

572
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
they should and whether or not it should

573
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
be provided with their edge cases

574
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
probably belongs to the as

575
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
so the three minus minus option is even

576
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
to tear some of this some of this stuff

577
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,520
which we put in back out and i'm

578
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,799
actually more comfortable with that

579
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,919
option than i am with uh with with three

580
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
by itself or uh

581
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,960
uh

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
especially we decided not to do the

583
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
others and uh and i could clarify what

584
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
deprecated number one means it's

585
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,158
probably not worth the effort

586
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
okay um

587
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,559
shall we take it to the main list

588
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
uh or maybe are you happy with trying to

589
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
do the fix

590
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,600
on the next slide i propose

591
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
and then have a quick discussion about

592
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
whether we want to move the stacks to

593
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
ass or where they should stay

594
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,240
does it work for you

595
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
i i think as far as far as five three

596
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
two one is concerned

597
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,480
i and several people spoke and very

598
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,679
included

599
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
uh are uh

600
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,799
are

601
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,159
are closer to three minus minus than two

602
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,120
three

603
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
and that would argue against choosing

604
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
either of the options on that spot

605
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
so i i think we're bound for the mailing

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
list but i hope that this time people

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
will actually

608
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
participate on the mailing list and

609
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
respond in

610
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,600
in soon time rather than in november

611
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,320
okay quickly

612
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,760
so victor said suggestion is fine

613
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
yeah this is pete i i think it would be

614
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,159
a mistake to completely yank the

615
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,559
sentence i think the suggested

616
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
replacement is fine

617
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,440
but i i think making believe that this

618
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
document can get away with

619
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
not discussing it at all is probably a

620
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
mistake we should try just fix the

621
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,840
sentence i think that's a good fix and

622
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,360
move on and better notes as well so

623
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
pete have you read the idea and noticed

624
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
that there are other places documents

625
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,840
where this is discussed

626
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,200
yeah i i suppose that's true um i i i

627
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
guess i don't feel exceedingly strongly

628
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,640
about it but there it is in this section

629
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
um it's been there i i

630
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,919
i would my inclination is to fix a

631
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,279
mistake

632
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
which that person you know the the

633
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,400
existing sentence is it's just a mess

634
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
rather than just ditch it i wouldn't uh

635
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,799
uh throw myself on my sword to keep it

636
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,679
um but i i think the fix is fine

637
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
i'm not throwing myself on any swords

638
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
either but um

639
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
but i know that this is not 5221 text

640
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,279
that we're

641
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,960
talking about bad sentences and it's

642
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
actually put in uh a meteor two ago

643
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
uh so this is this is recent text and

644
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,520
it's still on the target list i don't

645
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
feel nearly strongly about this as i

646
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
probably sound

647
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,440
but i think we need to make a uh a

648
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
careful and considered decision here

649
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
rather than saying rather than shutting

650
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,320
our shoulders and moving on

651
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
and and i think the text which isn't

652
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
documented most of which is from five

653
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
three three two one is very much part of

654
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,480
this picture uh one of the problems with

655
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
five three two one and this document and

656
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
two eight two one is this altogether too

657
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
much redundant text which talks in

658
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
almost the same way about almost the

659
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
same things and that's a danger in

660
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
itself

661
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,720
can i still suggest you try to apply the

662
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
text and then we'll have a

663
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
review on the mailing list of the whole

664
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,879
document of the sole issue

665
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
are you okay with that

666
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
um

667
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
since since i have no immediate

668
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
instructions the way when i'm going to

669
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
do a new version

670
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
uh i'm i'm okay with that but it's

671
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,360
almost meaningless as far as what

672
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,158
anybody else sees

673
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,080
applying to do taxes obviously

674
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,200
okay

675
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,679
well i'm just trying to suggest a way of

676
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,279
getting closure on the document this is

677
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,640
pretty much one of the two issues

678
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,720
remaining um

679
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
uh and and i would argue that especially

680
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
assistance is a full standard and based

681
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
upon the number of people

682
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
attending this meeting interests seem to

683
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,400
be waiting and we should really get it

684
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
right

685
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,919
all right let's take the mailing list

686
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
and and and and i guess to answer your

687
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
question i am as happy

688
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
putting in your text and then arguably

689
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
you should be taken out as i am leaving

690
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,799
the old text and that argument should be

691
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,279
taken out

692
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,039
let's just

693
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
do revision to the list right with the

694
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,080
text

695
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
that's where we want to go

696
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
i i don't i don't feel like we're going

697
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,440
to solve this but this problem in the 35

698
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,480
minutes we have remaining we've got

699
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
other tickets to get to so let's let's

700
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,760
get let's move the discussion on to the

701
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,679
list and keep going with it

702
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,880
i think

703
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
some flavor of option three whether it's

704
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
three or three minus minus is where

705
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,200
we're going with this we have some

706
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,159
proposed text on the slide here

707
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
or discussion the text on the slide here

708
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
so let's

709
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,880
see we can hammer out on the list and

710
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,440
move forward on this

711
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,480
john i i i think there will be a slight

712
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,559
uh definition of compromise i think

713
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,039
everybody is equally unhappy so let's

714
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,760
let's move on

715
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,200
all right

716
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
okay

717
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,919
my favorite issue i love to hate

718
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,840
hopefully uh so um i i read the mailing

719
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,760
list on this uh topic um and uh i

720
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
thought it would be actually more

721
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
controversial than i thought you know

722
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
i expected it to be more controversial

723
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
but it looks like

724
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,159
very proposed text

725
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,480
john the other john did a tweak to it

726
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
and people said yeah

727
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,679
i can live with this

728
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,559
dave clocker did it a tweak and they

729
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,039
said he can live with it and john you

730
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
you said you can live with it

731
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
um

732
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,559
with that in mind

733
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,799
oh

734
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,559
hold on

735
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
um

736
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,399
my proposal is

737
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,360
to kind of if we can quickly agree that

738
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,080
we cannot live with this

739
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,399
um

740
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,760
the other

741
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
uh suggestion is

742
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
if we can live with it

743
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,520
well

744
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
i think we should just try expert review

745
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,200
and see how it works and if we really

746
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,399
hate it then we can do it week later on

747
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,840
but i think

748
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,600
whatever is on the table is already

749
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,760
better than what we have in the document

750
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,960
but i want to ask a question i've tried

751
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,399
asking several times i've never gotten

752
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,840
an answer

753
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,120
do we have real world cases

754
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,360
in which someone has proposed an

755
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
extension

756
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,960
for other than private use in a small

757
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,640
community and has found the

758
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
current situation

759
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,600
or two burdens

760
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
i know there's no general problem with

761
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,320
the registrations

762
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,200
and as i've said in other places i'm uh

763
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
i'm very very concerned about those

764
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,960
but i'm still haunted by marshall's

765
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
uh argument about sparsity

766
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,039
and um uh

767
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,799
am wondering whether we have real world

768
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,840
pieces which justify worrying about this

769
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,679
or whether it is

770
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,039
it's just a theoretical problem

771
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
um

772
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
my

773
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
okay some of it probably wasn't said on

774
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,000
the mailing list but my interpretation

775
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880
of comments received from one proponent

776
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,200
is actually that specification required

777
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
would be sufficient

778
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,640
even though the person went into more

779
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
details saying you know all the troubles

780
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,360
that he got into and though that there

781
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,760
was no champion it wasn't the same issue

782
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,720
so

783
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
i think with the

784
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
one or more experts which uh

785
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,279
trying to be helpful and friendly

786
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,360
i think that's not going to be a problem

787
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,520
at least that's that's my interpretation

788
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,960
of of the proposal

789
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,919
and and again that's the comments

790
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
did not seem to be about a real world

791
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,799
problem which was a problem

792
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,120
it seemed uh

793
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
much more about a

794
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,440
more theoretical set of questions but

795
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,720
maybe i didn't understand it

796
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,000
okay quickly victor

797
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,279
uh expert review sounds uh excellent

798
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,000
i'll in fact be an early user of it at

799
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,360
some point before too long

800
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,600
okay

801
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
mary

802
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
so this is barry um

803
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,200
the the reason i wanted to get to this

804
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
slide before i said anything is i want

805
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
to make sure that we agree

806
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,600
that this slide has

807
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,640
the right

808
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,760
uh

809
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
the right guidance for the designated

810
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,960
expert

811
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
um this is what

812
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
i proposed that john tweaked and dave

813
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,279
tweaked and i think

814
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
the three of us are probably good with

815
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,360
this is everybody else good with this

816
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
so

817
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,240
um as a participant and as somebody who

818
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
didn't like first come first serve i'm

819
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,799
happy with this

820
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,360
and a thumbs up from braun is anybody

821
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,600
and a thumbs up from murray and thumbs

822
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,840
ups from everybody i see in the room

823
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
okay this is all cool i i think we're

824
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
done with this now

825
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
and i think we spent collectively way

826
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,519
too much time on it so let's move on

827
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
okay

828
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,679
we declare victory i was so depressed

829
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,240
last time i have to say

830
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,240
okay

831
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
all right do you want to

832
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
or they want me to talk

833
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
okay so uh we are moving on to the

834
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
applicability statement

835
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,480
issues um

836
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,000
some of these um

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,919
there is too much text to really show in

838
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
the room or to live edit um i think this

839
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,480
particular issue is we had

840
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,679
uh two rounds of discussions uh chaired

841
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
by todd then

842
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
um i think ken incorporated it in the

843
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,799
latest revision uh and

844
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,840
this is just a reminder for people to

845
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
have a look at this i think the text is

846
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,919
baked

847
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,000
i personally propose just to do a small

848
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,679
tweak to the text which i can send to

849
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,399
the mailing list

850
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
but i think this is good enough and

851
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,840
hopefully ready to be closed

852
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,679
final call final call for final call so

853
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,840
we'll take it to the main list to double

854
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
check

855
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,480
that people are happy with this

856
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
and unless there are strong objection on

857
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720
the maining list i think this will one

858
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,440
will be closed

859
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
okay

860
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,840
um

861
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
this one is actually new i don't think

862
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,679
we discussed it

863
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,079
pete

864
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,119
i'm so sorry this is your ticket that's

865
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,800
why i can't yeah

866
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,199
um there was basically a suggestion

867
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,560
saying that

868
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,480
maybe something should be said about

869
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,800
this in applicability statement

870
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,440
we have no proposal so far i think what

871
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,240
what do you want to do

872
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,320
my proposal is always make me write less

873
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,918
text and move it to the applicability

874
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,960
statement

875
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,599
um no we can still make you write taxes

876
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
we are going to end up in your documents

877
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,280
you don't have to do it now

878
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
okay uh

879
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,599
do

880
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,079
do you remember what you meant by this

881
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
there i think there was someone either

882
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,960
posted narada or something else about

883
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
the 78 question

884
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,760
and whether the it should have said 77

885
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,240
with the fold or what have you

886
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
um

887
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
so last time i checked i think your

888
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,640
document is fine and very clear

889
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,760
um

890
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
i i think

891
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
you know we may want to give examples in

892
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,680
the as to explain that there are going

893
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,800
to be times with headers that

894
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,160
you're not going to have a nice fold

895
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,240
point and so you may need to do

896
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
something different

897
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
and john has a comment and maybe he can

898
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,440
come up with what the heck we were

899
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
talking about

900
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
my only question here pete before you

901
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
sit down

902
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
uh is the use of the word always in that

903
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,480
first clause

904
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,040
because that's always absent sntp

905
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
extensions and various other kinds of

906
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,359
weird stuff

907
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,480
say it again sorry it's always plus or

908
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
minus

909
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,160
uh mine

910
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
stops so all so so if you're gonna do so

911
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,560
if it says always you may need to think

912
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
a little bit about that choice of words

913
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,800
right

914
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,520
i

915
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
don't think there's a problem here

916
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
that's even worth messing and messing

917
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
with in the as

918
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
uh i'm not yep sure what was proposed to

919
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,400
be honest

920
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
what was proposed was move the ticket to

921
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,720
the aas instead of leaving it on 53 22

922
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
best it's already done it's already for

923
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,480
aos but the question is what do you want

924
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,359
in ais to be said about this uh

925
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,680
who who is

926
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
is todd ostensibly the author

927
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
no that's something behind you the

928
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,960
person behind me is ostensibly the

929
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
author will work offline on some text

930
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
i'll propose some text to him and he can

931
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
put it in and he can and he will bug me

932
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
okay so can you do it this week please

933
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,640
he will get me to get the text done

934
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,480
as ostensibly one of the other authors

935
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
please include me

936
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
okay yes not a problem all right three

937
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,400
of you uh

938
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
will discuss some texts and bring it to

939
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
the mailing list thank you

940
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,880
right um

941
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,119
ticket number 35 erratum 3135 about

942
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
quarter string definition

943
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
basically this is the current text in a

944
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,920
s that talks about

945
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
funky use of empty quotes in left-hand

946
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,040
side and how it is likely to cause

947
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
problems in real world

948
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
i think suggestion is to close this

949
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,720
ticket as done

950
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,680
if

951
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
people have

952
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,079
any objections

953
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,680
in the room and we'll double check this

954
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,160
on the mining list

955
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,920
going once going twice

956
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
okay

957
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,079
okay ticket 51 is about uh

958
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,240
format elements

959
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,880
in web forms this was actually raised by

960
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,520
ned freed i think

961
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,160
the issue is that many web forms are

962
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,920
being too strict they don't even allow

963
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
pluses and various other things

964
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,640
uh so this is about adding some text

965
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
saying that

966
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,280
based on abnf you should really be

967
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,079
accepting these funky characters like

968
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,240
probably forward slashes equal signs and

969
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,280
pluses

970
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
at least

971
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,079
well in addition to dots and

972
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,720
alphanumeric stuff

973
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,240
obviously there is no text but you know

974
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
this is kind of deciding which direction

975
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,280
we want to go on this

976
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,400
buddy

977
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
this is barry lieber what about

978
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,960
internationalized email addresses

979
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,640
do we want to go there in the

980
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,839
applicability statement

981
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
good point probably a separate ticket

982
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,359
okay because this is talking about forms

983
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,079
not accepting uh

984
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,040
book standard us key addresses

985
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
which would be otherwise valid right the

986
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,359
question is whether we should also talk

987
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,560
about forms accepting non-ascii okay can

988
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,400
we have it as in in a minute as a

989
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
thing to discuss as well thank you

990
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,760
excellent

991
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,560
okay

992
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,880
right

993
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,599
i guess my question is do we expect this

994
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,040
to have any effect

995
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
putting it in this document

996
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
um

997
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
is there is there any point in telling

998
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
web forms what they should do and do you

999
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
think they would listen

1000
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
um i think there would be in a sense but

1001
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,760
there is actually uh

1002
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,359
you really have to be uh a bnf expert to

1003
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
figure it out from

1004
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,720
the base pack uh this is a common enough

1005
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,119
problem so maybe at least you know if

1006
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,960
it's written down then you can point

1007
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,280
people to say look it says there that

1008
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,119
you should do it

1009
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,319
cool

1010
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,760
that's kind of the point of it

1011
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,440
okay john john clemson

1012
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
and something to point to that is

1013
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,720
written in

1014
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
uh relatively plain english rather than

1015
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,240
uh a bnf or uh or whatever language five

1016
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,760
three two one or five three people were

1017
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,560
written in which is not english uh will

1018
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,040
it by itself anybody if they know but

1019
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,680
have your clear pointers useful and i

1020
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
say this as somebody who has this

1021
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
problem a couple times a week and uh and

1022
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,359
needs to need something to avoid it too

1023
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,119
and that's more or less the argument

1024
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,359
that they've made

1025
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,319
okay

1026
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,599
all right thank you

1027
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,400
hans york hi uh this is hansard hubble

1028
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,960
um i think this is a very useful thing

1029
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,920
so um i mean i see uh bronze concerns

1030
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,839
that obviously that might not change

1031
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,319
things immediately somehow but um

1032
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,839
i think this is really something in my

1033
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,920
personal experience even even i

1034
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
experience on a weekly basis that's our

1035
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,440
ill-defined

1036
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,079
validation algorithms and also

1037
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,599
when we do migration projects we see

1038
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,200
many different systems to accept many

1039
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,359
different standards and many of that is

1040
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,760
basically i think done in libraries

1041
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
so actually if we can point library

1042
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,000
developers to this um that might be

1043
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
great

1044
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,560
and that might even have an impact in

1045
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,200
the long term um i'm not sure about the

1046
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
abn f if it's easily so easy what i

1047
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
think would be really helpful in

1048
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
addition is maybe to have a

1049
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
repository a list of example data which

1050
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,280
is

1051
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,800
which can be tested for those library

1052
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,920
developments or something okay

1053
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,440
okay uh

1054
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
can so

1055
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,200
we can probably

1056
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,359
collaborate and we can find other people

1057
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,400
to help you with this john

1058
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
if i may throw a spanner in the works

1059
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,800
the html living standard has an email

1060
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
address validation

1061
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
pattern which

1062
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,280
vast numbers of libraries and web

1063
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,200
applications actually use

1064
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
and if we can't persuade them to make

1065
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,280
their pattern match our pattern we are

1066
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,119
completely wasting our time and their

1067
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,640
pattern specifically says we know this

1068
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,480
is only a subset of what this of what

1069
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,040
the mail spec says

1070
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,440
but we think it matches what male actual

1071
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,960
male systems accept and it's not

1072
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,000
terrible

1073
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,160
but my guess is we're not thrilled about

1074
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,520
it so i would like talk to him

1075
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,720
mark naughty hammer somebody but

1076
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
basically if we can't get we can't get

1077
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,800
their pattern on our pattern in

1078
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
in sync like we'll just confuse people

1079
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,880
and we're not going to improve things

1080
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,280
okay apropos uh the question about i

1081
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,599
think that's fair let's minute this that

1082
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,760
we need to double check whether

1083
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,359
how restrictive it is yeah yeah and also

1084
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,119
i don't think they're hostile to having

1085
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,240
stuff

1086
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
they're hostile to updating it i think

1087
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,319
they just

1088
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,000
there have been a lot of pranks and

1089
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,440
particularly back when there was a fork

1090
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,119
between the w3c and what wig w3c said oh

1091
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,240
we're going to make it we're going to

1092
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,079
we're going to do eai so all unicode

1093
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,599
characters are valid which of course is

1094
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,000
stupid right right yeah and yeah apropos

1095
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,440
unicode

1096
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,280
um i don't want to go there simply

1097
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
because having done if there are a

1098
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
number of experiments with with eai mail

1099
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,800
systems i see no pattern whatsoever in

1100
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,680
what character sets ea addresses

1101
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,359
actually allow so i wouldn't know what

1102
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,400
to say

1103
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,680
okay

1104
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,359
well at least we kind of declared this

1105
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,280
separate ticket so we'll figure it out

1106
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,040
when we get to it

1107
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,400
real quick as an attempt to take the

1108
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,839
path of least resistance would it be

1109
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,240
sufficient for the aes just to reference

1110
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,160
the document john just mentioned

1111
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,440
and say that

1112
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,599
web forms do have a restricted set

1113
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,760
consult this spec to see what's allowed

1114
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,000
um

1115
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,319
to be honest when i look at regular

1116
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,720
expressions my my brain still hurts i

1117
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,920
kind of feel like i didn't play in

1118
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,319
english

1119
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,440
apropos that their pattern is not

1120
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,880
horrible but it could be better i think

1121
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,760
if we could engage with them

1122
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,040
constructively and say hey we're the

1123
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,640
male experts and here's a pattern that

1124
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
we think will work they might want to

1125
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,359
say oh thank you

1126
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,040
yes yes i mean we shouldn't rule out uh

1127
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,520
ability to actually do do changes if

1128
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,280
they are well um

1129
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,359
argued from output all right

1130
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,160
john

1131
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,760
i think we need to understand really

1132
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,520
what you're designing to say that there

1133
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,319
is an

1134
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,400
active pew going on between w3c and wg

1135
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,319
over some of these issues

1136
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,560
and the last thing we want to do is to

1137
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,920
point to one of the other of their

1138
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,119
documents

1139
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,000
one of the other of their

1140
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,880
incomprehensible documents and say pay

1141
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,319
attention to that incomprehensible

1142
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,920
document rather than the other

1143
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
incomprehensible document or our

1144
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,240
incomprehensible document uh clear

1145
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,760
english language would be a good idea

1146
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,079
okay

1147
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
victor you've figured out

1148
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,839
uh yes the interface has lost

1149
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,880
um i can volunteer to write uh fairly

1150
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
advanced regular expressions if people

1151
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,839
want that i've uh i don't get scared by

1152
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,560
them okay that's not actually what

1153
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,160
no but if we want to could you know you

1154
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,359
said

1155
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,440
you know we know but okay

1156
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,280
i think if people want to do regular

1157
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,200
expression it's kind of a separate topic

1158
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,960
in a sense of and there was actually a

1159
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,480
sample proposal uh a draft at the time

1160
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
i would like this written in plain

1161
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,839
english first

1162
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,760
okay and then we can figure out whether

1163
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,480
we

1164
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,520
want to include regular expression and

1165
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,680
we can do a call on the main list okay

1166
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,599
all right thank you for volunteering

1167
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,720
dkg very quickly yeah um

1168
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
i definitely think that we should exert

1169
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
what uh influence we have on the other

1170
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
standards bodies to

1171
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,720
produce something that is regularly

1172
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,319
usable

1173
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,160
and that does mean some amount of

1174
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,599
functional material which is like a

1175
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,440
regular expression i'm fine if that goes

1176
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
alongside english text

1177
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,319
but

1178
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,119
the

1179
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,200
i think the um

1180
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
the test suite that you're describing is

1181
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
really the key thing to say here's a

1182
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,040
bunch of things this one is valid here's

1183
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,839
why it's valid here's why it's not right

1184
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,319
but we that that set of three things is

1185
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,599
really what you want if you want people

1186
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,280
to take it seriously as

1187
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,880
implementers

1188
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,040
test suites specific

1189
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,400
regular expressions and an english

1190
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
overview

1191
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,960
okay point taken

1192
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,599
all right uh ken i think you have enough

1193
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,079
direction for initial version and then

1194
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,560
we'll see what happens

1195
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,079
okay trying to speed up a little bit

1196
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,640
oh yeah the new ticket that

1197
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,400
that people wanted to discuss so

1198
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,040
the current ais basically has a stub

1199
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,720
version in the mime section and i think

1200
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
some people want to change that

1201
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,200
let's have a chat

1202
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,200
[Music]

1203
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,960
uh this is barry

1204
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
ken and i talked about this the other

1205
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,960
day and i um i think the answer to this

1206
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,119
is that we should say a fairly minimal

1207
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,920
amount about uh mime there

1208
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,160
uh because what's likely to happen is

1209
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,599
when we're finished with

1210
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,800
53 21 and 53 22 bisses

1211
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,079
we will consider adding mime as our next

1212
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,040
pass

1213
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,359
and at that point we will probably

1214
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,760
revise the applicability statement for

1215
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,720
that

1216
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,520
but right now all we should say is that

1217
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,319
mime is a widely implemented and very

1218
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,520
important

1219
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,800
extension to the internet message format

1220
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,280
go there and look at it and we will talk

1221
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,559
more about this later and that's

1222
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,280
probably all we should say

1223
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,599
okay

1224
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,000
p peters is saying plus one plus two

1225
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,400
plus ten

1226
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,720
okay

1227
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,760
so so real quick a barry pete are we

1228
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,960
looking for

1229
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
like normative text like we recommend

1230
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
you support this you should support this

1231
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,920
are we going to dig into it and say

1232
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,680
these parts of the spec

1233
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,520
have never been used avoid them

1234
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,240
you're really thinking

1235
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,119
with respect to mine yes not now i mean

1236
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,839
i think all we should do now is say

1237
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,119
if this is widely deployed and there and

1238
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,119
it's documented here

1239
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,079
and

1240
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,839
further advice will come later and

1241
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,599
that's that's that's that's all i would

1242
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,960
want to say now

1243
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,680
right

1244
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,760
yeah it it doesn't actually i think it

1245
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
doesn't have to be normative

1246
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,599
and pete is quite good at phrasing

1247
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,280
things which are normative but without

1248
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,000
using shoots a must

1249
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,200
pretty much you know

1250
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,760
okay

1251
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,160
okay that was actually quicker than i

1252
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,000
expected sounds good um

1253
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,960
i'm going to uh so there are three more

1254
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,280
slides on issues which i built um

1255
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,839
i think should be closed again subject

1256
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,160
to mailing list verification etc etc

1257
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,030
um if people want to object

1258
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,129
[Music]

1259
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,400
i think you probably should take

1260
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,680
discussion to the maining list

1261
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,759
realistically but if people want to

1262
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,040
okay everybody says yes

1263
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,880
yes to take it to the mailing list now

1264
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,720
to

1265
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,280
just close the ticket

1266
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,280
john

1267
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,440
it started was not about

1268
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,280
one of the places where this started was

1269
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,040
not about the domain names just

1270
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,119
addresses but about the use of ip

1271
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,400
addresses

1272
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
yeah there is a separate ticket about

1273
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,559
this hold on okay if there's a separate

1274
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,720
ticket about that that's fine

1275
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,000
it's the next slide actually

1276
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,920
okay addresses in the hello

1277
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,359
that i have no problem with closing the

1278
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,200
previous one and

1279
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,799
we should deal with this if you need to

1280
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,800
okay and the proposal is to close this

1281
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,200
one as well

1282
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,480
so

1283
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,720
since i've still got a video on i will

1284
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,680
record

1285
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,279
record by holding my nose

1286
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
sounds good

1287
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,240
um and the last one

1288
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,799
do you want to just quickly

1289
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,839
i know that the proposal was to close

1290
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,680
this ticket because that's what it said

1291
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,760
in the ticket documentation itself so

1292
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,559
let me just find out real quick

1293
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,400
oh yeah this was about

1294
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,839
there's there are timeout specifications

1295
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,079
that are in 5321 and probably previous

1296
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,400
issue or previous versions

1297
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,000
and there had been some discussion about

1298
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,200
whether or not to revisit them because

1299
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,440
they seem really freaking long for

1300
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,760
modern networks versus when 8 21 was

1301
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,960
first written

1302
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,559
um

1303
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,319
as we've discussed it over the months

1304
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,800
there's been a whole lot of

1305
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,280
might as well leave them there's been no

1306
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,359
but they're also like iot networks where

1307
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,599
it's still relevant right so there's

1308
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,520
been no no call to change them

1309
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
whatsoever so

1310
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,119
the proposal is just to close the ticket

1311
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,720
okay

1312
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,000
we john

1313
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,240
if people wanted to i i'm not

1314
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,160
necessarily in favor of it

1315
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,079
put a little bit of text in the ais

1316
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,079
which points out that under many

1317
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,720
circumstances those timeouts

1318
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,240
in the modern world those timeouts may

1319
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,680
be a little bit long

1320
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,079
but uh i don't know at the moment how to

1321
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,800
write that text and uh and would prefer

1322
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,760
we didn't but uh but we should be sure

1323
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,640
we

1324
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,319
don't eliminate that possibility without

1325
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,079
thinking about it if we thought about it

1326
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,640
we should move on

1327
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,640
okay so um

1328
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,839
we're actually at the end of the slides

1329
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,280
the only thing i

1330
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
i propose maybe we will look at

1331
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,119
outstanding

1332
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,319
tickets for smtp spec and i'll just

1333
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,440
quickly talk about

1334
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
oh yeah uh john do you want to talk

1335
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,559
about your i think first to do or shall

1336
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,200
we look at tickets first

1337
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,480
uh let's talk about that briefly very

1338
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,680
briefly

1339
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,000
because i think that it's uh

1340
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,319
i think we're having an argument that

1341
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,240
borders

1342
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,040
let's go say words like silly but sorry

1343
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,079
um

1344
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,720
it's it it's it's clear to at least many

1345
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,280
of us that uh that we cannot promote

1346
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,960
that to a bus not for operational

1347
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,119
reasons i don't understand the

1348
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,040
correspondence of the list

1349
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,000
because i think that the person who is

1350
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,160
advocating changing into a must turn

1351
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,520
around and explain why it should be

1352
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,240
assured so i'm confused i just did not

1353
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
want to let this

1354
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,559
go past this meeting without at least

1355
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,400
some minimal discussion and awareness of

1356
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,480
what's going on if we have to continue

1357
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,920
arguing with them on the list i guess

1358
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,400
that's our danger

1359
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,720
mrs barry i completely agree with john

1360
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,800
the only the only thing that needs to

1361
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,319
change is the knot needs to be

1362
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,960
capitalized as well capital should lower

1363
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,000
case not is not a

1364
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,520
bcp14 keyword

1365
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,040
otherwise it's fine

1366
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,280
if the stupid editor made that mistake a

1367
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,480
stupid editor will correct it

1368
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,880
okay

1369
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,200
okay can you see the list of issues

1370
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,160
yes

1371
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,399
uh

1372
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,340
i think so

1373
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,680
[Music]

1374
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,280
let's do this first

1375
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,400
okay

1376
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,880
uh we do have five minutes uh

1377
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,040
right so

1378
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,280
we have some way forward towards seeking

1379
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,359
55 the foreclose received we

1380
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,960
i think pretty much closed iron

1381
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,599
registration policy

1382
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,799
there are two tickets 61 and 12 about

1383
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,440
mailing lists and improved definition of

1384
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,040
mailing lists so um

1385
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,920
a few months ago ned proposed to write a

1386
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,480
document this is not going to happen now

1387
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,720
i tend to think that

1388
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,640
we probably don't have energy for this

1389
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,640
so i suggest we just do nothing

1390
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
should people

1391
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,760
in slow time write a document on the

1392
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,400
topic we can

1393
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,280
revise it some future day date

1394
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,960
uh

1395
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,000
and

1396
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
the only other ticket is nullimax and i

1397
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,640
think

1398
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,598
discussion was that the current text is

1399
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,680
okayish and so i should close this one

1400
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,839
john any comments

1401
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,279
are you happy with this

1402
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,880
and at the risk of sounding like teeth

1403
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,559
making it go away so i don't have to do

1404
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,839
anything is fine

1405
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,760
fine okay so

1406
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,960
because pete asked

1407
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,760
um

1408
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,839
i think there was one ticket asking for

1409
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,359
enhancement which we are not going to do

1410
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,319
yeah

1411
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,400
this is barry so does that mean that

1412
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,520
after john posts the next revision for

1413
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,839
5321 this we're ready for working group

1414
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,440
last call absolutely yes

1415
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,200
so

1416
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,960
yes this was

1417
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,599
kind of a ticket basically why is this

1418
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,520
so uh

1419
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,000
email address is so complicated and it's

1420
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,559
like um

1421
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,000
oh it's your your democrat

1422
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,240
i was just gonna i'm just gonna say that

1423
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,599
looks like something somebody would have

1424
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,119
written on the dmarc list and it was

1425
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,640
that somebody

1426
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,540
right

1427
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,590
[Music]

1428
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,599
okay so

1429
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,240
yeah i don't think we'll deal with this

1430
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,359
are you happy with this pete

1431
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,559
you know we we try that over at d mark

1432
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,119
and he just keep coming back so um try

1433
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,839
to ignore him but it doesn't

1434
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,759
work this is public

1435
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,200
also too much conversation off mike so

1436
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,359
uh

1437
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,119
all right so

1438
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,880
um

1439
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,839
and if we look at list of issues for

1440
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,960
applicability statement it actually

1441
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,920
doesn't look too bad

1442
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,959
so

1443
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,040
we'll have some text about the first one

1444
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,880
we're about to close the second number

1445
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,799
54.

1446
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,520
we talked about 51.

1447
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,160
i think we're about to close uh

1448
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,559
number 40 recommended smtp extensions

1449
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,480
but i'll bring it to the main list

1450
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,559
there will be some suggestion about 38

1451
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,240
close 35

1452
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,920
close 19

1453
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,480
close 16.

1454
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,000
uh

1455
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,599
close number one right number eight

1456
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,480
this is actually kind of important yes

1457
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:38,870
um

1458
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,319
[Music]

1459
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,799
this started about a year ago and there

1460
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,640
was a long discussion about an extra

1461
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,160
registry

1462
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,599
going through the main english

1463
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,520
discussion i realized there was no

1464
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,280
consensus so i i suggest we just drop it

1465
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,880
and ned was a big

1466
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,680
motivator and part of the discussion and

1467
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,599
i think he sort of initiated it but at

1468
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,880
the end he he didn't like doing it

1469
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,760
either so i think

1470
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,599
closing it with

1471
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,559
do nothing is probably the best way

1472
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,799
so

1473
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,839
hopefully the plan is john will update

1474
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,480
the document

1475
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,000
uh which will go to last call um knowing

1476
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
that next month is august it's probably

1477
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,359
going to be september just to make sure

1478
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,319
that people are paying attention

1479
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,799
and then

1480
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:35,280
we do have some work to do on ais but

1481
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,960
um

1482
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,839
i think we will very closely uh very

1483
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,480
soon will have a call on opening new

1484
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,040
issues so i think it's actually getting

1485
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,040
pretty big now

1486
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,420
um

1487
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,799
[Music]

1488
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,440
so if people think that there is a major

1489
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,640
thing which is unclear or missing

1490
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,160
now it's a good time to actually bring

1491
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,359
it up

1492
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,119
look at the mic but you know on the menu

1493
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,119
list

1494
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,880
this is barry is our plan to send 53 21

1495
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,880
and 53 22 bits to the isg together yes

1496
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,000
and then to send as to the iesg sometime

1497
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,079
later

1498
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,359
maybe soon later but not yes with them

1499
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,359
uh

1500
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,920
i think it sort of depends you know if

1501
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,520
if we uh feel that ais is

1502
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,079
so nearly done you know like can be done

1503
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,200
within a month after that then we can i

1504
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,119
just said okay

1505
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,160
right i know that i hope ties

1506
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,839
i'm just thinking of the

1507
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,640
burden on the iesg and i would prefer to

1508
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,520
get

1509
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,359
21 and 22 taken care of before the iasg

1510
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,400
sees the ais oh yeah yeah absolutely

1511
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,480
look at that later it will be before yes

1512
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,359
it's just a question if you send as nine

1513
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,039
months later people forget what they

1514
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,039
want to document maybe you know a month

1515
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,240
or two later

1516
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,400
okay yeah okay i'm good with that

1517
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,119
cool john

1518
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,640
i bought the deck too for the same

1519
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,480
reasons but uh

1520
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,039
but if we're gonna send the

1521
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,599
5321 best 53

1522
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,960
22 risk to the uh to the iasg without

1523
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,599
waiting for the gas we better be very

1524
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,680
very careful with the ais

1525
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,520
it doesn't say anything which seems to

1526
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,839
contradict the two-way documents

1527
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,520
um and the good news is that if we get

1528
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,839
53 21 finished

1529
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,000
next month or in september i will be

1530
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,520
able to pay more attention to the ass

1531
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
sounds good i mean

1532
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,839
fantastic

1533
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,559
just actually a question for murray but

1534
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,839
from the mic so but we all hear it

1535
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,359
yeah are are you okay with

1536
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,599
running the two through

1537
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,480
where

1538
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
you're we're gonna have to deal with the

1539
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,599
as

1540
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,960
we'll need to be watched to make sure it

1541
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,240
doesn't contradict and all that

1542
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,119
the isg is happy not dealing with it

1543
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,480
um

1544
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,839
no i think that's fine i think we could

1545
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,520
even i could even warn them that you

1546
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,960
know this is coming these are related

1547
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,160
but they're going to be separated by a

1548
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,039
little bit

1549
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,039
try to remember

1550
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,839

1551
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,400

1552
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,760
anything else to say but i think you

1553
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,440
just said what you wanted to say so

1554
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,319

1555
