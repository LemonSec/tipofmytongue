we realized that uh mark and folks um

and so we just got in touch and in touch

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
and

20

join forces and

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,479

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
the research

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,680
system organization of the ietf we are

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
not doing standards here

64

our c's and doing internet drafts so

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
using the

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,159
like same tool chain

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
but

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
the documents that we produce are mostly

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
informational or experimental so this is

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,360
not

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,080
any internet standards track work here

73
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
okay and

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
been around in dinergy yeah just

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
think of i think about um signing up

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
the mailing list um

78
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
and um so we

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,680
really need a note taker um for today um

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
so we have one hour so not a lot of time

81
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
um but we are hoping to get many good

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
ideas um out of this meeting and um we

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
really really need to capture those

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
and

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
yeah as usual notetaking doesn't require

86
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,519
um you know

87
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
discussions or

90
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,159

91
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,159

points that uh were discussing and then

138
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
we we hope to

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
get a do a round of discussion get

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
feedback or new ideas and

141
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
um kind of um

142
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
use this meeting for like also starting

143
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
um like the next steps in in this

144
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
direction so like figuring out topics

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
but maybe also way of working

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,120
where they're working and

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,080
yeah without further ado i would say um

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,560
alicia let's start with the summary um

149
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,720
this is a very quick report for this

150
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
workshop we organized

151
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
last year in june

152
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
we should have written the report early

153
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
everyone's busy

154
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,120
so

155
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
you can see that the report put together

156
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,440
as a group effort

157
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
and therefore everything goes right it's

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
a group effort anything goes wrong

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
nothing is not my own

160
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
mistake but i will will fix it

161
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
we look forward to people's

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,280
input into this report next slide

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
so

164
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,639
the

165
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,319
identification that mitigation effort

166
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,560
for internet centralization

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
actually started a few years back

168
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,479
this is a very incomplete list showing

169
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
on the slides about the existing

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,960
internet draft on the topic

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
in particular i want to point out that

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
you know the first field

173
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
identifies

174
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
the observed centralization

175
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
phenomenons

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
and the second half of the list you can

177
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
see that there is a great attention

178
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,199
paid to

179
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,280
the security issues

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,520
ongoing on the today's internet

181
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
it may not be the best thing to say but

182
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
uh let me say i think we are yet to gain

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
upper hand

184
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
to put the internet security uh really

185
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
under complete control i think that's a

186
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
big factor

187
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,799
that

188
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,719
i think accelerated the centralization

189
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
as we gonna elaborate

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
in the following report

191
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,279
in short i think those existing work

192
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
actually reflected the many shared

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
understandings and the insight

194
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
but uh so why this not very early

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
workshop on the topic

196
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
we set the goal to say that instead of

197
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,599
them into

198
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
designing new solutions let's first

199
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,120
understand

200
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,519
what are the root causes what has

201
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
happened in the last 30 some years

202
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,120
that turned the internet from originally

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
somewhat pretty decentralized operations

204
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
into where we are today

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
exactly

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
what happened

207
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,080
then

208
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
what we can learn

209
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
from those observations

210
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
we want to put a caveat up front

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
the workshop discussions are very

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
limited in scope

213
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
we largely focused on the application

214
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
providers

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
consolidation centralization and didn't

216
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,680
get into other aspects of the

217
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
consolidation for example internet

218
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
access is obviously today are in the

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
hand of very few providers and there's a

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
number of other aspects of the

221
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
centralization

222
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
but in the following

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
report

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
summary we're going to mostly focus on

225
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,399
what happened to the applications

226
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
so this is only one effort into

227
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
understanding the problem space i think

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
more effort will be needed to better

229
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
understand the overall picture

230
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,480
in the workshop jeff houston i hope he's

231
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
here

232
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
thank you jeff if i say anything wrong

233
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,959
please

234
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,600
correct me so jeff houston gave a great

235
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,880
opening talk

236
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,920
and told us that the centralization is

237
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
nothing new

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
it's actually started

239
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
with industrialization

240
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
by over a hundred years

241
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
you can observe from a history

242
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
that economic economy of scale does

243
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
drive consolidation

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,839
so that the industry always evolves

245
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
towards centralized control over

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
specific

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
industry sectors

248
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
and uh

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
you know it's kind of a nature

250
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
when the corporates wanted to maximize

251
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
their profit

252
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,200
that's

253
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
not exactly

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
the same action they're going to result

255
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
in

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
maximizing the user interest or

257
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,880
society's interest as a whole

258
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
and therefore in the history you can

259
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
think back that time in 1890

260
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
the sherman

261
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
anti-trust act to curtail the control

262
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
power

263
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
of the industrial giants

264
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
and many years later that the same

265
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
antitrust act also

266
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
dissolved the att monopoly

267
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
in the telecom industry

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
i encourage everyone to actually watch

269
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,720
the workshop report and i'm sure you're

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,440
going to enjoy jeff's talk the very

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
vivid

272
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
and very interesting

273
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
but uh look at that today's internet

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
industry

275
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,120
there's really not a surprise

276
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
that it's really by nature

277
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
they followed the footsteps of the past

278
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,079
giants

279
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,639
of course time changed technology

280
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,680
changed

281
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,079
and therefore the specifics are

282
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,519
different

283
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,880
the past the industry giants they

284
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,440
exploited the labor forces

285
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,120
to accumulate the profit and today

286
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
the industry

287
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
of the internet

288
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,480
does something different

289
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
they uh

290
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
gain this uh

291
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,279
innovative

292
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
personal data and then profit from the

293
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
advertisement

294
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
gains

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
so coming to the next slide uh some of

296
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
our specifics this is given by uh

297
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
christian fuedema i hope it's online

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,760
to explain

299
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,320
what exactly happened as like the

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,480
samples through the past 30 years

301
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
you can see that the internet

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
centralization before we paid attention

303
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
you know this uh pioneer companies they

304
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
actually started by

305
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,760
investing in to provide very much needed

306
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
service when the internet started

307
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
like the search engine like the email

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
like social networking things that

309
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,200
the user in general very much wanted

310
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
of course over the time those services

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
get consolidated

312
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
we started with

313
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
different search engines and then got

314
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,199
into yahoo and eventually

315
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,120
google take off

316
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,000
for email i'll have more to say later

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
and social networking facebook was not

318
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
the first one but today it is a dominant

319
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
one

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,720
and more services get ideas over time

321
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,360
so you can observe this

322
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
positive feedback loop you get more

323
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,639
users

324
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
you have more incentive and the more

325
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,000
input to provide those users better

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,279
services

327
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
that's gonna attract the more users then

328
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
you get higher revenues and you attract

329
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
more users that's really kind of a

330
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
snowball

331
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440
loading effect that gets the big guys

332
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
even bigger

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
and

334
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,519
when

335
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
these collecting services are collecting

336
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
the user information

337
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,839
under

338
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,639
title of providing you more service

339
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
that goes to a different degree

340
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,199
there's no longer distinguishable

341
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
from this new term called the

342
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,720
surveillance economy

343
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
the service providers wants to know

344
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
you're well so therefore say when you do

345
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
search they can provide you exactly

346
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
which one

347
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
but the more they know about you i think

348
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,920
the more influence they can have over

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,639
you

350
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,040
through the information selectively

351
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
provided to you

352
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,839
there is an accident book that's in the

353
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,920
workshop reference

354
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,040
titled

355
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,079
surveillance capitalism

356
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,560
that book actually actually provided the

357
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
numerous

358
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
specific

359
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
evidences

360
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
on how facebook and even google

361
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
influenced

362
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
the internet users

363
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,079
believes understands with regarding to

364
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
the contemporary

365
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,199
political social economical issues

366
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
next slides

367
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,480
so

368
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
the

369
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
the networking uh started from

370
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,360
the dominance of carriers in the early

371
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
days you know people mostly

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
paid attention to say hey which isps

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
actually provided service for most users

374
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,880
and that is no longer much of a topic

375
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,759
now

376
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
because

377
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,040
the attention the money and the profit

378
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,639
have moved up the protocol stack

379
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
so later microsoft became the dominance

380
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,959
in terms of providing the

381
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
operating system platform

382
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,600
and then you can see today it's not so

383
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
much operating system

384
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,759
that dominates the market or make the

385
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
most profit inside it is really the

386
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
application services

387
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,399
so that why is the applications

388
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,480
because the technology moves forward uh

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
network services this really becomes

390
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
commodity services

391
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
while you look at the applications

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
when you control that you essentially

393
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
get much easier time to uh

394
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
become a monopoly so if you move on to

395
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
the next slide

396
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
the uh

397
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,079
applications on that

398
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
specifics number three

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
um

400
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,559
the applications

401
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
actually is much easier to become

402
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
dominant

403
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
because they

404
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
they don't have to do anything lower

405
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,039
layer

406
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,520
to standardize this standard that's that

407
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,880
inside they just install the application

408
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
on your browsers

409
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,240
and then

410
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
they are ready to go

411
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,280
so this is the

412
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
so if we want to decentralize the

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
applications that christian warned us

414
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
that's really uphill battle

415
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
against the centralized monopoly because

416
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
decentralized systems or applications

417
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
you need standards and we all know how

418
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
long and how much effort that it takes

419
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
to get into the standard

420
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,120
ready and go

421
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
it's really far easier cheaper faster

422
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,960
for the application monopoly providers

423
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
to add the new things and the new

424
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
features they don't need

425
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,000
standardization you don't need to

426
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
coordinate with their competitors they

427
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
just do it

428
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
and deploy the code

429
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
so in uh

430
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
uh putting the workshop

431
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,840
reported together we actually speculated

432
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
this question

433
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
that is we commonly hear people seeing

434
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
that the distributed

435
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
protocols somehow get decentralized

436
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,080
so we looked into answering that

437
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
question it's really that the protocols

438
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
get decentralized or something else

439
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
actually happened

440
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,840
you look at the protocols

441
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,400
merely shapes the bits around

442
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
even the higher level protocols dns

443
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
it'll facilitate that shaping by

444
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,799
translating the names into addresses

445
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
the protocols are carriers they don't

446
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,280
make a decision on where

447
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
the pack is the most

448
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
it's the application deployment

449
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
that actually make that decision

450
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
and the next slide

451
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
that's going to say that in the early

452
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,760
days i was very very early in the game

453
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
right

454
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,080
first at mit later i went to xerox park

455
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
and then i went to ucla

456
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
even

457
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,600
after i got to ucla ucla we provided dns

458
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,640
services email services our own

459
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
web services

460
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
that's the norm of the day

461
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
the in the applications were

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,320
decentralized

463
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
provided by largely individual

464
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
institutions

465
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,320
but the ucl we did that as a service

466
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
to ucla

467
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
user community they are not

468
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
revenue generating business

469
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
but once the service providers grabbed

470
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
those applications

471
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,679
making them to be revenue generating

472
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,280
services

473
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
that is really economical forces

474
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
drives consolidation

475
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
the bigger the better the more profit

476
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
more control and hence bigger

477
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,120
so as you can see on the slides we just

478
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
say that

479
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
bigger sizes you can afford more

480
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
investment into the better services and

481
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
in particular

482
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
better defense against all kinds of

483
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,960
failures and security attacks

484
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
i give you specific example

485
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
email

486
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
who can do better spam

487
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,799
filter than gmail

488
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
i guess

489
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
probably no one

490
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
there's very few places that still run

491
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
their own email services i think the

492
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
uclacs department as one of those

493
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,320
exceptions even the engineering school

494
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
turned into gmail service

495
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
i can tell you that i have a gmail from

496
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
a personal use i have the department of

497
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,480
email

498
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
for my business i mean for my work use

499
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
and i can tell the difference

500
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,559
on my gmail there's virtually no spam

501
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,360
on my cmx cs account

502
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
there's a big percentage

503
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
so that really illustrates that

504
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,440
centralized service does have their

505
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,799
edges

506
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,760
because

507
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
the

508
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,400
lack of effective security mitigation

509
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,880
make providing individual services

510
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
become the last analyze

511
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,799
variable so i put it there to say that

512
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,159
there is an economy of skill that drives

513
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:36,960
the

514
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,760
centralized service to become a bigger

515
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
but security really plays a big role in

516
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,440
accelerating this whole process

517
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,480
so i hope those uh two slides last one

518
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
this one helped answer the question how

519
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
come there used to be distributed

520
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,720
applications become centralized

521
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
that's because they become

522
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,039
a revenue generating

523
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,159
services

524
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,480
and the economy drives them into

525
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
centralization and thanks to mark he

526
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,880
offered this

527
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
reference you can see the the pointer to

528
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
the real paper this is just the

529
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,320
you know somehow evidence to show that

530
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,600
for web hosting there's yet another

531
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
service that got centralized this is

532
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
only showed a five year span

533
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
of web hosting for

534
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
websites under different tlts as you can

535
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
see in the five years

536
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,200
the centralized services roughly roughly

537
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
doubled

538
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,000
i think over the last two years is

539
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
probably getting a lot worse

540
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,280
as well

541
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,679
so if we move to the next slide

542
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,200
we can say that

543
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
make it short there are multiple factors

544
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,919
but the top two factors driving the

545
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,280
centralization its economy of skill

546
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
and security threats that's i think the

547
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
outcome conclusion out of the workshop

548
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,440
just make it simple

549
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,400
so

550
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
what to take it away uh going to the

551
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
next slide it's just these two things

552
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
i'm repeating myself

553
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
the centralization becomes so rapidly

554
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,000
advancing because there's very few

555
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
regulations

556
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,280
to counter measure the big market force

557
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
the economy economy of skill really

558
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
motivates corporations to go big

559
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
and we cannot

560
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
deny that the fact

561
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
as a matter of fact uh jeff pointed out

562
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,799
very clearly this is not really the pure

563
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,559
size

564
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
the real concern about centralization is

565
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
their control power

566
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
their influence they decentralize the

567
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,279
influence and control

568
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
over all the users and over the security

569
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
of the society as a whole that's our big

570
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,440
big concern

571
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
so security challenges you know why

572
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
security accelerated the whole

573
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,679
centralization because we don't really

574
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,039
have

575
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,480
this magical

576
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
power to mitigate the security threats

577
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,480
very effectively for ddos mitigation

578
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
that's the fact that the major

579
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
mitigation means is absorbing it

580
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
and the only big

581
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
uh systems has a capacity to do that

582
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
there are limitations on the existing

583
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
web security framework that doesn't

584
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,400
allow your phone and my phone

585
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
communicate directly how we communicate

586
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
go up to the clouds go through the

587
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
facebook then we communicate your phone

588
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
doesn't really know my phone home that

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
it belongs to there's no security in

590
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,279
today no security no communication and

591
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,679
we don't really have security solutions

592
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
as of now deployed

593
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,960
for direct user-to-user communication to

594
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,080
enable

595
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
truly uh decentralized applications

596
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
that's just uh maybe

597
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
stopping it and then uh the workshop

598
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,120
actually spent some time elaborate on

599
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
the difficulties

600
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
on developing and deploying security

601
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,240
solutions

602
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
it's a hard it's really hard and people

603
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,679
pointed out i forgot who mentioned that

604
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,159
security itself is really hard and the

605
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
interoperable security is even harder

606
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,039
if you want to decentralize applications

607
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,039
if you go next slides i think my time is

608
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,440
roughly up

609
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,919
so reflections inside

610
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,240
i mentioned earlier but jeff pointed out

611
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,760
there's a conflict between the corporate

612
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
profit maximization interest

613
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,440
and the society's

614
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,679
overall interest

615
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
so the society strives when you keep a

616
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,200
balance between economy between the

617
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
regulation and the technologies and

618
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,600
today we're in this kind of limbo stage

619
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
because economy drives

620
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,039
drive these things forward by the large

621
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
the regulation i think they try they

622
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
really try but the a big challenge

623
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,840
what exactly to regulate and how

624
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,159
and then the technologies

625
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
as i mentioned we are finding the hand

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,799
behind the security threats we don't

627
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,440
have effective solutions to mitigate

628
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
them as of now

629
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
so as a result i think at least for

630
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,600
us drafted the report we believe that

631
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,799
the

632
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,960
effective regulations and the

633
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
legislation

634
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,080
we're actually playing a deciding factor

635
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,360
in curtailing the unconstrained market

636
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,400
as much as this itf community has a

637
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
brilliant engineers researchers

638
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,400
designers

639
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,320
the technology solutions alone

640
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
we don't think that it can

641
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,880
mitigate the centralization on its own

642
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
so it doesn't mean that ways

643
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,200
just step aside and watching how the

644
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,679
regulation goes as i mentioned already

645
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,400
regulators need our help uh to figure

646
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
out what to regulate i think it's really

647
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,679
our responsibility to help them

648
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,559
and we work with the regulations

649
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
effectively by providing new solutions

650
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,559
for the

651
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,679
already identified security problems

652
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,120
we listed a couple here

653
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,279
your input is really there what

654
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,080
additional new technical solutions will

655
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,200
help

656
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,679
help assist the regulation the new

657
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,200
regulation and move the internet away

658
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
from further consolidation and towards

659
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,679
the

660
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,840
decentralize the control

661
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
so

662
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,679
um

663
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,520
this is my last slide essentially all

664
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,799
those one more

665
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
so further discussions are needed and

666
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
that we thought that uh thing rg could

667
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,679
be the platform

668
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,679
for collecting all the inputs and

669
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,480
following a platform

670
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,120
to carry on the future discussions i

671
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
think they're really hard questions that

672
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
need answers

673
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
so say that i always tell the students

674
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,520
if you're facing a big problem where do

675
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,080
you get started you ask yourself this

676
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
question

677
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
if the god grants all your wishes

678
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
what do you wish to happen

679
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,159
if we have a clear answer to that

680
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,360
question

681
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
then we can from there

682
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
figure out how we get there so that very

683
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
first question is

684
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
what do we wish to see

685
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,360
as an ideal outcome out of all this

686
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,600
effort mitigating

687
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
decentralization

688
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,360
and that need to take into account all

689
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,399
these

690
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,480
major factors in the play

691
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
big data has advantages

692
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,600
economy of skill has advantages at the

693
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,120
same time we must protect the end user

694
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
interest

695
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,320
so

696
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
you know ideally can we gain back the

697
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,679
control

698
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
but without necessarily

699
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
dissolving those

700
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
the cyber jacks

701
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
what regulations

702
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,919
suggest and what kind of measurement

703
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
input we will provide

704
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,720
for the regulators to make the new rules

705
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,080
and what kind of

706
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
input you can have

707
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,720
put into uh that list

708
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,360
so i guess

709
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
dirk that probably we're gonna just

710
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,000
start a discussion

711
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
so what's missing from whatever the

712
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,720
summary i just presented

713
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,799
and what futures

714
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,440
directions people want to suggest

715
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
and what the specific work

716
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,960
we should

717
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
start

718
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,399
yeah we have a few people um lined up in

719
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
the queue and

720
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,760
let's start with uh jose

721
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
yeah i

722
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,200
i really i really uh

723
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
like this workshop but i come from a

724
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
completely different world

725
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,640
i come from the iot world

726
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,559
where we have the i would say the

727
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
internet and the small

728
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
and where

729
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,240
we're at this point doing distributed

730
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,480
and very decentralized applications

731
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,559
um inside our own networks

732
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,600
and

733
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,840
so of course there's blockchain all kind

734
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
of other stuff but i'm not even going

735
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,279
there because we're a lot of time we're

736
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
within the same domain so we don't

737
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,000
really have to deal about deal with this

738
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
but when the challenge that we have is

739
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,399
because of the centralization

740
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,880
a lot of the systems we're using

741
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,799
or are vertically integrated so although

742
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,799
we have two sensors

743
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
that are co-located in the same place

744
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
the first time they talk to one another

745
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,519
is somewhere in aws or azure or google

746
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,880
or whatever

747
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
and and we're working really hard

748
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,840
to make sure that we can create the

749
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,720
applications that are necessary for next

750
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
generation

751
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,120
uh industrial systems for example or

752
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,640
or or smart cities where sensors talk to

753
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,799
one another because they are located in

754
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,480
the same place

755
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
so i i understand that your workshop

756
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,679
looked at i would say the big picture

757
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
but there's also this internet in the

758
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
small

759
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,159
this this need to have

760
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,559
co-located devices on the same network

761
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,120
to be able to talk to one another

762
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
and not being completely vertically

763
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
integrated and i think

764
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,120
the centralization

765
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,360
actually is preventing that and the

766
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,840
reason we need

767
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,760
decentralization is we need to have the

768
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
system to talk to one another

769
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,960
and

770
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
uh you know you were there maybe early

771
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
this morning when somebody was

772
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
mentioning the use of ai and networking

773
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
and if we want to have data driven

774
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,799
systems and ai driven systems

775
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,080
we need to have local information to be

776
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,720
integrated so i would say on top of the

777
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,760
conclusions that you have about you know

778
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,480
i would say that the applications that

779
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
are used by billions of people there's

780
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
also the application that are used by

781
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,559
billions of sensors

782
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,320
and that's a different it's a completely

783
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
different world

784
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,880
but we are facing this every day so

785
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
that's a comment i'm done

786
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,159
thank you

787
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,039
um

788
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,320
by the way are we taking notes

789
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,039
i'm taking notes i said i would

790
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,799
yes we have okay great thanks

791
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
okay dino's next

792
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,039
hi this is dino um

793
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,480
i'm not going to ask a question but i

794
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
want to get a reaction by using an

795
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,279
example

796
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,240
i think all the monopoly companies that

797
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720
are offering centralization

798
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
are helping for the examples you use

799
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
with email and sometimes maybe we give

800
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,080
up the decentralization for the

801
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,519
advantages

802
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,760
of centralization but

803
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,360
in the in the case of text messaging

804
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,240
lisa and i are in the same room here

805
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
the monopolies offer

806
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
security as a feature and they believe

807
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,600
it has value and that will pay for it

808
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,640
maybe not explicitly but implicitly

809
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
but if i want to text

810
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
alicia right now in the room and we're

811
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
on our iphones all our messages are

812
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
going to apple they claim that they

813
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
can't read the messages because our keys

814
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
are local but they could be storing the

815
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,279
data which we don't know what they're

816
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,840
going to do with later or not but we can

817
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,440
still communicate and it's still

818
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,200
somewhat private

819
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
but we both have iphones that have their

820
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,760
own wireless interfaces and we can talk

821
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,440
directly to each other right now over

822
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
bluetooth

823
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,440
and if the users objected or requested

824
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,399
this feature to these monopoly companies

825
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,079
where we would want to talk directly to

826
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,480
each other still encrypted but across

827
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,879
the airway here 20 meters

828
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,800
that this would be a good feature and i

829
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,879
have a feeling they would be motivated

830
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,119
to do it if we'd be willing to pay extra

831
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,679
for this feature just like we pay extra

832
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
for not having advertisements in various

833
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,719
apps

834
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,719
reactions

835
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,000
so

836
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
let's collect a few views and statements

837
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,679
and

838
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,399
then

839
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,239
maybe try to come back and structure

840
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
this a little bit um so so far we we

841
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,599
have heard um you know things about

842
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,879
um

843
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,560
local communications or iot in the small

844
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,079
so dino just alluded to um direct local

845
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,800
communication and the like trust anchor

846
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
topic that licia actually um talked

847
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
about

848
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,000
but let's hear from a few more people

849
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
vittorio is next all right

850
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,960
with terrible torah from open exchange

851
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,040
so i'm sorry i didn't this is all i know

852
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,720
about the workshop so i only it's a

853
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,640
an immediate reaction

854
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
so you ask what is missing well i was

855
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
surprised because in the end you listed

856
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
these two factors as the major factors

857
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
for centralization and uk security i

858
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,800
agree and then you mentioned economy of

859
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,839
scale

860
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,880
but economy of scale is something that

861
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
i mean it allows someone to outperform

862
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
the other companies on the market by

863
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,800
offering the same the same product at a

864
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
better quality at the same price or at a

865
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
lower price with the same quality

866
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
and this can be through in the lower

867
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
levels maybe in the infrastructural

868
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,040
products but most of the consumer-facing

869
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,880
products we're talking here are free

870
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
products like instant messaging like

871
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,240
search

872
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
and so there is no price competition for

873
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,920
search or for instant messaging or

874
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,160
forward and so i don't understand how

875
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
economy of scale can really be a factor

876
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,760
here accepting the fact that maybe it

877
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
increases the margin for the companies

878
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,680
that are providing this but it doesn't

879
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
make things better for consumers because

880
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,520
it doesn't even lower the price

881
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,480
and so i i mean i'm also surprised that

882
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,839
by not seeing

883
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,119
the other factors that are often

884
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,640
mentioned i don't know maybe it's just a

885
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,480
matter of terminology but when we have

886
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
these discussions in other environments

887
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,240
that mostly in europe mostly maybe in

888
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
competition discussions there are other

889
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
worlds that come up like one gardens

890
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,560
network effect self-preferencing so a

891
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,400
number of practices which are both

892
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,119
technical and business practices so i'm

893
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,480
wondering whether this came up in any

894
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,320
way whether it's just a matter of

895
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,400
aligning the language or it's really a

896
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,240
part of the analysis that is missing

897
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
i don't know if i can jump out of the

898
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
queue to answer a question

899
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
i think a search is a very important uh

900
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,839
service

901
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,720
it's only today's implementation of a

902
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,839
search

903
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,119
required as a centralized monopoly

904
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,520
but me as maybe i'm the researcher to

905
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,800
blue sky thinking but i firmly believe

906
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,960
there are different ways

907
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
to implement a search function

908
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,800
that

909
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
doesn't have to be provided by

910
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,680
centralized monopoly

911
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,079
okay we need to open mind and look into

912
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,480
different ways of doing the same thing

913
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,280
and not can confine our thinking to say

914
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,320
this is how things got done and this way

915
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
of doing business

916
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,560
need monopoly let's think about

917
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
different approaches if we can talk

918
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,960
offline we actually have no i i agree

919
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
then if your mobile phone will just give

920
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
you by default decentralized also a

921
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
single company then you can make

922
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
whatever you want

923
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
like you know i already mentioned

924
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,520
we are so great in terms of uh the

925
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,720
low-level communication technologies the

926
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,040
bluetooth can work a wi-fi can work

927
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
directly

928
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,960
what is not working as a protocol

929
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,079
the individual users have no identities

930
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,200
and therefore you don't have associated

931
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,560
crypto credentials to enable the secure

932
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,640
communication directly

933
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,280
between dino and me and this is the

934
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,240
thing

935
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,200
we could have done but we haven't

936
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
sachin

937
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,520
yeah hi

938
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,000
there's sachin here i had this point

939
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
that you made about the email thing

940
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,079
the point that the university email was

941
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,760
not

942
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,560
uh removing as much spam as gmail has

943
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,839
been doing

944
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,359
and just

945
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
the email example you gave

946
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,440
about spam

947
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,599
yeah so this comes back to the point

948
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,960
that i was actually discussing with the

949
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,040
fast mail guys and this is important

950
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,160
because technically speaking email is

951
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,480
not something that cannot be run easily

952
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,720
by normal people i mean reasonably

953
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,480
technical people

954
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
we are all capable out here i guess of

955
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,160
running our own email servers

956
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,320
at least 80 percent would be

957
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,680
the standards this server just run

958
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,480
the problem happens is when i run my own

959
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,800
server somewhere someone would have

960
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,200
added that particular ip address to some

961
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,960
long list which will prevent my email

962
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,880
from going out

963
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
which does not happen if i'm taking an

964
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,160
email service from a gmail or a

965
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,240
microsoft or somebody like that

966
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,079
and that's i think one of the issues

967
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
that we possibly should i don't know how

968
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
we can solve it it's more of a social

969
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
issue rather

970
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
technically i think it's a solved sort

971
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,680
of a thing but we need to get back to

972
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,040
the basics and try to possibly

973
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,480
understand what people really want to

974
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,680
decentralize how they want to

975
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,160
decentralize it what they're giving up i

976
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
mean that's just

977
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,160
my thinking

978
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
yeah thank you again

979
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,839
i'm so old

980
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,040
when the email started in my early days

981
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,119
it's all decentralized the email servers

982
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,200
individual organizations around their

983
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,280
things by the way during that those

984
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,000
years there's no spam

985
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
there's no compromises it's really the

986
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,680
security the big factor destroyed

987
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,560
decentralize the email service

988
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
so the question is

989
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,119
how will you find the solutions

990
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,760
that effectively mitigate those security

991
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,079
strikes i think that is the question

992
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,319
all right hi andrew campbell speaking um

993
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,000
in terms of

994
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,119
you post the question what's missing

995
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,599
i would have expected to see uh loss of

996
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,119
resilience uh on here um something

997
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,720
there's been a significant loss of

998
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,839
resilience in the internet

999
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,200
infrastructure

1000
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,880
arguably because of standards and

1001
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,760
because of consolidation uh in different

1002
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
ways i think that's an issue

1003
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,960
i agree with victorio uh that it's not

1004
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,720
economics of scale it's much more about

1005
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
network effects

1006
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,880
uh at the application layer so we expect

1007
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,119
uh reference for that and the other

1008
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,119
thing i don't think i saw is loss of

1009
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,640
privacy

1010
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,680
um

1011
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,240
and again

1012
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,359
because of the application layer and

1013
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,040
the network effects of the application

1014
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,800
layer there's research out there which

1015
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,599
tells us that people

1016
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,599
don't want to give up their personal

1017
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,440
data but feel they have no choice

1018
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,400
so they're

1019
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
reluctantly giving it up

1020
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,960
and that's an enormous issue again

1021
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
that's because of the network effects

1022
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,079
they feel they have no choice but to use

1023
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,359
these apps

1024
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,599
um and therefore the sort of digital

1025
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,119
surveillance that's undertaken at the

1026
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,319
application layer is is a huge problem

1027
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,079
um and it's facilitated by the

1028
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,839
consolidation thank you

1029
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,280
thanks andrew

1030
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,960
um it's just uh as a note is just closed

1031
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
the queue because um i think we're

1032
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,359
running out of time otherwise um so but

1033
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,560
let's let's move on um mallory please hi

1034
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
everybody mallory noodle from the center

1035
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,920
for democracy

1036
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,319
technology um i

1037
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,079
think that the

1038
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,760
report back is really interesting and

1039
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,040
i've been thinking about it a lot so

1040
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,440
thanks for presenting it i wonder if it

1041
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,000
doesn't look very very different

1042
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
at different layers of the internet i

1043
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,720
mean

1044
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,839
i was just thinking about the case of

1045
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,200
hardware

1046
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,040
and then you follow that naturally all

1047
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,800
the way down and it's like do we want a

1048
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,640
bunch of companies mining for rare

1049
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,680
minerals in the congo like no

1050
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,280
so you know there are going to be some

1051
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,560
natural points where things get

1052
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,680
centralized um but potentially mapping

1053
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
out

1054
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,200
very specifically in each of these

1055
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,920
layers from each of these perspectives

1056
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,599
all along the stack

1057
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,280
what are the

1058
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
sort of benefits sometimes of

1059
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,280
centralization what are obviously the

1060
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,680
detriments what are the mitigations also

1061
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,240
what does it look like from

1062
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,800
providers as users versus actual end

1063
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,960
users i think a lot of us in this space

1064
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,839
um think about end users but we actually

1065
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,560
come to the space as as implementers in

1066
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,520
our users um in our own right in a

1067
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,359
different sort of view so i think that

1068
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,640
that work could actually be really

1069
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
useful because we do have a lot of

1070
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,920
really interesting

1071
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,760
examples that we like to talk about a

1072
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,800
lot

1073
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,079
especially when it comes to things like

1074
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,599
interoperability

1075
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,640
or the

1076
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,520
um

1077
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,280
you know anti-patterns like this idea

1078
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
that you know blockchain solutions are

1079
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
fully decentralized when we know very

1080
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,560
well from a code perspective they aren't

1081
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,440
but you know um so these examples abound

1082
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,480
and a lot of people have brought up

1083
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
really good ones today i wonder if that

1084
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,520
sort of

1085
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,680
overall very high level survey of

1086
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
different effects wouldn't help bring a

1087
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
little bit more concrete a concrete

1088
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,720
approach to actually mitigating them

1089
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,480
in very different ways and understanding

1090
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,560
where one solution and one

1091
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,319
layer isn't actually the same solution

1092
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,440
you would get all the way up in the

1093
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,640
application layer for example

1094
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,240
okay thank you

1095
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,720
jeff

1096
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,359
hi let me try this with a mask on is

1097
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,880
that too loud

1098
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,240
it's okay

1099
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,920
folk have said i've often get too

1100
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,560
depressed about this and you know just

1101
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
um spread around my depression

1102
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,359
i'm going to continue with that

1103
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,480
because this is about as bad as it gets

1104
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
and you sort of look at what can you do

1105
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,319
and the first question is

1106
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,160
the whole idea of the internet was to

1107
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,400
walk away from a highly regulated

1108
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,880
structure where national entities ran

1109
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,280
the telephone systems

1110
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,240
and they ran by a common set of rules

1111
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
into a market-based deregulated

1112
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,000
structure

1113
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
where competitive market pressures were

1114
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,079
meant to impose a discipline on the

1115
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,200
industry

1116
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,040
that provided users with what they

1117
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,079
wanted so will markets

1118
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,119
naturally get us out of the situation

1119
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,880
they drove us to

1120
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,560
the answer is no

1121
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,640
because what's happened is that

1122
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
monopolistic power that's being

1123
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,720
exercised in these markets

1124
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,000
now makes any form of competitive entry

1125
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,920
suicidal

1126
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,359
if you wander around and look for

1127
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,440
venture capital these days to disrupt

1128
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,560
the market

1129
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,040
you need tens of billions of dollars of

1130
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,839
venture capital any less you're burning

1131
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,760
the money in a bonfire

1132
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,800
will markets help us no

1133
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,520
will regulation help

1134
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,119
no

1135
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,760
the reason why oddly enough is we've

1136
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,359
enabled an

1137
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
abundant

1138
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,920
computing communications and storage

1139
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
system

1140
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,640
that now enables the projection of power

1141
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,720
globally

1142
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,280
way beyond nation states

1143
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,319
way beyond regional coalitions

1144
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,599
so any group any country

1145
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,400
even the eu an amalgam of countries

1146
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,599
finds itself an acute disadvantage

1147
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,839
because they cannot amass

1148
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,760
the regulatory impost

1149
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,040
and there is no template

1150
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,400
this is not telephony anymore

1151
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,760
there's no industrial widgets

1152
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,240
how do you regulate

1153
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
what should we do

1154
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,599
and the real answer to that is we don't

1155
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,560
know

1156
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
no one knows it's new experience

1157
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,640
okay so those two won't help will users

1158
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,160
get us out of this

1159
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,520
no

1160
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,240
because this entire industry

1161
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
is focused on giving users

1162
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,119
precisely what they want

1163
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,240
tik tok

1164
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,960
is what they want not what they're

1165
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,720
forced to do oh god i've got to do

1166
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,520
tick-tock today no way this entire

1167
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,839
industry is actually based around

1168
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,160
understanding and predicting your needs

1169
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,400
and meeting them

1170
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,200
so anything you try and do to curb that

1171
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,040
you're actually going against what users

1172
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,520
want i want my search i want my mail i

1173
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,839
want my facebook whatever

1174
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,480
and so users aren't going to help

1175
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,040
so that brings the depressing picture

1176
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,559
we've been here before and christian

1177
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,280
whitman actually alluded to it in chat

1178
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,880
if you think you can get out of this

1179
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,359
with evolutionary change

1180
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,119
you're dreaming

1181
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,440
this is not going to be evolutionary the

1182
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,280
pressure's built

1183
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,200
and the only way the change happens is

1184
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,359
actually revolutionary

1185
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,720
at some point

1186
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,319
it becomes such a damning wall of stasis

1187
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,240
that nothing ever changes

1188
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
that the pressures to change

1189
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,559
knock it all down that's the way we

1190
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,960
destroyed telephony it was unpleasant

1191
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,359
lots of folk locks lost jobs

1192
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,839
all of these changes ultimately once you

1193
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,839
get to this position

1194
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,160
there's no clean way out

1195
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,480
other than actually revolutionary ways

1196
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,160
that actually end up destroying the

1197
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,480
incumbents in the existing sets and

1198
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,559
replacing with different structures

1199
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,640
we're going to do the same again

1200
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,000
and you know i think that's wrong i

1201
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,319
think it's really sad but

1202
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,000
frankly i can't see any other way out

1203
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
okay alicia do you want to respond to

1204
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,160
that

1205
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,200
uh yeah i already said something

1206
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,280
but but let me say the couple wine side

1207
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,119
let's be clear

1208
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,119
the internet did break the monopoly

1209
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
this really broke the telecom

1210
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,880
connectivity monopoly

1211
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,280
so therefore today when we talk about

1212
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,000
centralization we're talking about

1213
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,119
different things that get decentralized

1214
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,920
not the low level

1215
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,319
ip level connectivity

1216
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,440
not yet

1217
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,400
i don't know whether it actually will be

1218
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,520
uh consolidated in some near future but

1219
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,640
but

1220
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,079
so today's centralization is really

1221
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,240
at a much higher level

1222
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,359
than what the ip started aim the form i

1223
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,680
want to make that very clear

1224
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,200
as of today

1225
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,960
the

1226
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,359
bgp regulated the connectivity that's

1227
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,319
not in any single hand yet

1228
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,920
um

1229
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
regarding the

1230
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,960
revolution

1231
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,640
jeff talked about

1232
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,319
that's i think i very much

1233
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,000
agree with

1234
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,800
that i hinted in the earlier

1235
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,319
comments about how to do search today if

1236
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,640
you do the search google does then

1237
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,960
google find the best way

1238
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,000
but uh if you really open up the mind

1239
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,920
you think in the fundamentally different

1240
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,800
ways of doing search that's really a

1241
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
revolution

1242
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,800
that can bring you a very different

1243
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,599
world from them

1244
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,960
okay

1245
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,960
christian

1246
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,799
okay let's first say that i cannot agree

1247
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,359
doesn't with good and

1248
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,839
it will take some kind of

1249
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,640
dry thing

1250
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,000
on the other hand i am not so much for

1251
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,319
a heads on the on the top of spikes and

1252
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,319
things like that i mean blood only

1253
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,119
becomes blood and more blood so

1254
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,559
what would be the pacific way to do that

1255
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,640
the

1256
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,400
the one thing that we asked me that was

1257
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,760
a bit mean thing in alicia's summary

1258
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,280
is that a huge part of her the

1259
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,400
problem is the accumulation of power

1260
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,319
and the accumulation of power is not

1261
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,319
just about insulin strength but it's

1262
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,520
also about big data

1263
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,800
and

1264
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,119
big data can be used to make better

1265
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,160
product but it can also be used to

1266
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,760
as a barrier to entry it can be used as

1267
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,800
a mean of influence and things like that

1268
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,880
big data itself

1269
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,680
derive from a very specific

1270
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,200
decision

1271
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,640
to fund the internet services using

1272
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,040
advertisement and make them appear free

1273
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,640
and

1274
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
behind this power and decentralization

1275
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,000
power

1276
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,559
we have this advertisement business and

1277
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,800
personalized advertisement

1278
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,040
which is largely driven by big data now

1279
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,359
it has also driven the acquisition of

1280
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,119
data

1281
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,160
so

1282
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,119
i believe that if we want one avenue in

1283
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,720
which to

1284
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,200
start pushing the ball

1285
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,640
regulating big data and regulating

1286
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,000
also the making of money by trafficking

1287
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,240
into user data

1288
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,480
is a way to do that

1289
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,440
because

1290
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,800
if people

1291
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,559
when i mean if you look at the industry

1292
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,400
in which people pay directly for their

1293
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,559
services

1294
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,800
you do see concentration but you also

1295
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,319
see competition

1296
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,240
people pay for their car

1297
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,480
and there are many car companies people

1298
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,400
pay for the air travel and there are

1299
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,440
many are travel companies

1300
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,400
but

1301
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,160
if you don't pay

1302
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,520
three brings centralization

1303
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,160
and i think that the one revolution for

1304
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,078
the internet it has to stop being free

1305
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
okay

1306
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,119
let's

1307
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,839
hear from dominic

1308
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,319
thank you um looks like i get the last

1309
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,800
word uh what's been interesting about

1310
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,359
this discussion is that it shows that we

1311
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,359
need further discussion

1312
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,359
and that this particular group is

1313
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,960
probably the best place for it there's

1314
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,200
so much interest and impassioned

1315
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
interest that i've just seen in the last

1316
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,640
30 minutes um

1317
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,880
but also just a couple of other thoughts

1318
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,559
and ideas for direction one is

1319
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,400
measurement we've already seen a couple

1320
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,960
of really good presentations in

1321
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,440
the workshop last year and

1322
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,680
and researchers looking at that

1323
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,520
i particularly also like mallory's

1324
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,440
suggestion on looking at different

1325
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,559
layers

1326
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,800
russ who can't be here today

1327
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,119
has a really great draft on protocol

1328
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,440
consolidation which the point of which

1329
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
is around complexity

1330
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,839
um and finally i know we've just been

1331
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,280
discussing uh the economic point of view

1332
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,559
which i do think is really a main driver

1333
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,880
um but also looking at the unintended

1334
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,920
consequences of uh regulation and other

1335
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,000
aspects that show up around the

1336
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,559
ecosystem of the the technical aspects

1337
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,520
would be a really good approach so

1338
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
thank you for having this discussion

1339
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,839
today

1340
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,480
thanks dominic um

1341
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,800
yeah that was actually um

1342
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,760
a good statement in a sense that um

1343
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,559
so i mean we have heard many inputs and

1344
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,240
so even if you

1345
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,480
for example buy um you know jeff's um

1346
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,240
a pessimistic view

1347
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,400
um

1348
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,880
you have the different things you could

1349
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,400
do right so you could um say

1350
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,440
you know um think about disrupting

1351
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,200
developing developing disruptive

1352
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,640
technologies

1353
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,240
um but even if you do evolution somebody

1354
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,880
probably should analyze um things very

1355
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,839
very well like um say so what are the

1356
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,319
the factors what what is uh has been the

1357
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,040
history and so on so we have been

1358
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,640
circling around all these different

1359
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,000
potential

1360
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,920
activities um

1361
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,760
so in the workshop last year and also

1362
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,960
today

1363
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,160
and um so yeah we felt um

1364
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,839
would be maybe

1365
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,520
interesting to identify say

1366
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,799
activity

1367
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,760
topics that people would be most

1368
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,359
interested in

1369
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,720
for say follow-up activities

1370
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,400
and

1371
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,960
yeah it's it's um

1372
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,160
the energy started with a say maybe over

1373
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,559
ambitious approach um some some years

1374
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,640
back actually when you know

1375
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,280
people thought okay blockchain is uh is

1376
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,720
um saving us from centralization

1377
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,520
and

1378
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,720
so now we have taken this step back and

1379
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,640
so also at the workshop last year i mean

1380
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,799
we we we heard really

1381
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,000
um

1382
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,599
very

1383
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,119
well thought through

1384
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,720
presentations of

1385
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,359
the historic developments and

1386
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,559
yeah also

1387
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,040
the commercial

1388
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,760
centralization concentration

1389
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,440
and

1390
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,920
the question is so what's next so what

1391
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,760
where where can we actually make a

1392
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,040
difference and um so that's i think

1393
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,960
something where we have gotten new new

1394
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,799
inputs today um

1395
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,680
but we need to structure this uh somehow

1396
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,559
and

1397
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,720
so that's i think next on the agenda for

1398
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,879
us

1399
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,319
so i think that might be my cue

1400
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,280
um

1401
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,520
we only have a couple minutes left uh

1402
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,760
but uh let me sort of

1403
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,440
look to the future rather than the

1404
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,359
workshop in the past

1405
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,640
uh

1406
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,400
what i'd like to do is if you look at

1407
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,480
the second bullet that's on the screen

1408
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,520
right now

1409
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,599
one of the things that we observed in

1410
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,280
the last

1411
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,960
12 to 18 months

1412
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,200
is that there are many people writing

1413
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,359
independent submissions individual

1414
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,640
submissions

1415
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,400
that are talking about various uh

1416
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
various features

1417
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,799
of consolidation and centralization

1418
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,160
some of them are talking about the

1419
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,240
economic part of it some of them are

1420
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,079
talking about the architectural part of

1421
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,880
it how how centralization affects things

1422
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,400
like the end-to-end principle and so

1423
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,200
forth

1424
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,040
some of it talks about specific

1425
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,319
protocols

1426
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,839
we do have a lot of independent drafts

1427
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,680
that are floating around

1428
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,000
that don't have a home

1429
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,520
to talk about there's not a place

1430
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,880
in the either the ietf or the irtf to

1431
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,200
actually do this work

1432
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,240
and

1433
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,559
i had set up a

1434
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,400
a side meeting today

1435
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,480
to actually talk about how to fix that

1436
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,440
problem

1437
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,240
how to find a new home

1438
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,480
for the work that is obviously first of

1439
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,119
all already going on and second of all

1440
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,280
as dominique said the passion in the

1441
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,839
room talking about the results

1442
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,359
of the workshop

1443
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,200
and so i'm going to propose i'd like to

1444
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,960
propose and i'll take this to the list

1445
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,920
as well

1446
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,440
that dnrg become that focal point

1447
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,119
and that for the individual

1448
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,040
contributions

1449
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,400
that have been made

1450
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,119
on centralization and consolidation

1451
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,440
that we bring it to a research group

1452
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,920
that's actively interested in it and

1453
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
actually can be a home to future

1454
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,359
discussion

1455
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,880
keeping dinrg active and sort of

1456
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,119
energized on the topic

1457
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,480
and again

1458
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,040
giving individual authors a place to go

1459
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,960
to discuss their ideas

1460
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,680
something that's really missing now

1461
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,559
now we're almost out of time but that's

1462
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,760
a proposal that you'll see on the

1463
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,760
mailing list and if there's support for

1464
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,400
it

1465
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,559
i think the chairs and i will move

1466
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,920
forward

1467
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,000
to try to make that happen

1468
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,680
and that would be the future direction

1469
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,480
here

1470
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,480
is to activate ti nrg by actually making

1471
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,359
it an active home for these kinds of

1472
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,160
conversations but also not just the

1473
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,440
conversations but real contributions

1474
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,559
right contributions on economic aspects

1475
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,200
contributions on architectural aspects

1476
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,839
contributions on protocol aspects and we

1477
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,359
see that there are individuals already

1478
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,119
interested in doing that

1479
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,640
and so that's the proposal that i'm

1480
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,000
going to make for

1481
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,280
moving us forward here uh in dinrg

1482
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,839
when given that we are nearly out of

1483
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,359
time jerk i

1484
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,480
i once again encourage all of you to be

1485
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,319
on the mailing list where i'll actually

1486
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,160
put that proposal to the mailing list as

1487
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,119
well

1488
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,160
um but uh maybe let me hand it back to

1489
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,440
dirk here to finish up

1490
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,040
yeah thanks mark um there's still two

1491
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,319
people in the queue i don't know if you

1492
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,359
want to honor their request

1493
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,200
yeah so i mean we still have a bit of

1494
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,799
time so christian do you want to add

1495
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,119
something

1496
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,960
i think that if someone wants to

1497
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,799
associate with tommy he makes a very

1498
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,559
good point i mean if

1499
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,480
if we think that cutting off the

1500
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,319
trafficking of data will cut off the

1501
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,040
oxygen that decentralization

1502
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,119
then the atf has something what to do

1503
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,119
which is minimizing data

1504
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,839
in everything we do

1505
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,640
and

1506
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,960
minimal data will be

1507
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,440
minimizing data across protocols

1508
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,960
will be very nice

1509
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,680
it's something that we can do

1510
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,920
the uh the other thing that we could do

1511
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,319
is look at the very example that

1512
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,960
leash has given about the

1513
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,440
distributed dots and things like that

1514
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,280
there is work going on in

1515
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,520
the itf to

1516
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,480
have open solutions like those problems

1517
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,640
so the more work we get there

1518
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,280
the better we make the system as well

1519
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,359
these are two concrete area in which we

1520
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,839
can work might very well let's

1521
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,680
ask for the the third thing which is can

1522
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,319
we develop this with applications and

1523
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,839
yes of course we know we can develop

1524
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,119
this street application we've been doing

1525
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,839
that for 50 years that's not the issue

1526
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,079
okay

1527
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,359
so lenny is the last on the queue

1528
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,160
in a close queue

1529
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,599
thank you um

1530
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,480
so

1531
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,200
i

1532
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,119
i think

1533
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,280
what can we as engineers do

1534
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,680
we as people contribute to the ietf what

1535
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,240
can the iecf do

1536
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,040
i think it comes down to uh the best we

1537
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,880
can hope for is to build

1538
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,000
solutions that lower the bar to entry uh

1539
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,359
and make it inexpensive for anyone

1540
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,160
uh to contribute now

1541
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,038
you know if if the giants end up then

1542
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,680
providing a level of value that the

1543
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,079
smaller players decentralized players

1544
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,319
couldn't each meet then i don't know

1545
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,319
that there's a solution to that um you

1546
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,799
know ultimately the consumer decides and

1547
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,160
if you know

1548
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
the consumer finds gmail to be better

1549
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,440
than running a mail server in their

1550
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,599
house they're going to do that as one of

1551
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,200
the few people who run

1552
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,119
a mail server in my house

1553
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,280
it used to be easy it's not easy now

1554
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,799
it's kind of kind of a pain in the ass

1555
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,559
but uh

1556
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,119
you know people move to where they find

1557
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,280
value and if they're going to find value

1558
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,119
from a giant they're going to use the

1559
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,039
giant

1560
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,400
i don't know that

1561
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,920
we can

1562
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,039
um

1563
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,799
i don't i don't know we can fix that and

1564
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,960
i'm pretty confident regulation

1565
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,559
i don't have a lot of confidence that

1566
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,359
regulation could solve that problem

1567
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,880
i'd be more fearful that whatever

1568
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,720
regulation comes would probably make

1569
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,000
things worse and would probably

1570
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,799
empower giants more than it would hurt

1571
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,319
them

1572
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,200
so

1573
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,039
you know just empirical evidence does

1574
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,559
not suggest that

1575
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,119
regulation helps giants or hurts giants

1576
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,200
but rather it usually helps them

1577
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,440
so i think ultimately the best thing we

1578
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,799
can do is

1579
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,720
to focus on designing solutions and

1580
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,960
empowering technologies and evangelizing

1581
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,599
technologies that um

1582
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,079
democratize uh

1583
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,920
you know the contributors of

1584
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,319
content and the users of the technology

1585
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,799
and you know

1586
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,720
whoever builds the best mousetrap wins

1587
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,559
whether it's you know

1588
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,440
a a bunch of small companies or a few

1589
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,200
large ones

1590
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,280
but i think that this working group

1591
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,119
does provide value in

1592
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,400
you know maybe creating a level of

1593
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,680
consciousness

1594
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,640
uh on those issues

1595
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,319
okay um

1596
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,839
we are out of time lisa do you want to

1597
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,640
say some final words

1598
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,119
i think it's a really interesting

1599
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,520
discussion i appreciate is the last

1600
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,839
speaker uh input we can chat more

1601
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,839
afterwards but i guess this is a very

1602
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,240
good uh starting point uh like mark

1603
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,640
mentioned that we can get to this thing

1604
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,039
rg as the platform

1605
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,680
to at the focal point to continue this

1606
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,359
conversation i really

1607
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,400
agree with that suggestion that's so um

1608
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,960
to say now

1609
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,200
all right thank you very much for coming

1610
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,920
and um have a nice evening in

1611
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,359

bye-bye

1614
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,839
yeah i think we're probably gonna

1615
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,039
organize uh uh interim meetings let's

1616
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,760
wish if we can put our actor together so

1617
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,880
stay tuned down the menominees

1618
