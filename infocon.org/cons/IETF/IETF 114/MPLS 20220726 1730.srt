open andy malice

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,360
over the

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,600
last two days i think

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
and we've been

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,119
discussing the 25 year anniversary of

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
the mpls working group

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
so i have a little bit of history

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
so

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
prior to

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,679
november

47
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,160
1996 there was a lot of

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
kind of unorganized work or organized

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,560
work organized by different companies

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,440
but

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
november 6 1996

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,959
we had the first what we call the tag

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,319
switching buff

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
at mit in boston

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
and

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,160
that was followed

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,160
um

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
by

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
that first buff in mit was outside the

60
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
aitf meeting we planned a new buff at

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
the itf meeting

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
in san lucia in april

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
1997

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
but what happened was that

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
joel help and that was the

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,680
responsibility at that time he beat us

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
to the goal line and he actually

68
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,680
shorted the mpls working group

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
in march 1997 and

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,680
the meeting we had in

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,840
san jose was kind of a mix

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,800
between above and a normal

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
working group meeting

74
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,560
as i remember it dj and yours were

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
sharing and

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
i was a notetaker

77
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,760
and

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
roscal and eric rosen

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,319
i think yakov had presentations

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
the very first meeting that actually was

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
a meeting that also will run like a

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
[Music]

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,630
itf working group meeting should be run

84
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,080
[Music]

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
was run in the iota in munich

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,879
and it took place uh wednesday august

87
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
the 13th

88
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,200
um

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,519
so that was all the

90
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
all the things that i people requested

91
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
slot people

92
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
people made presentations that wasn't

93
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
kind of a company sponsored and things

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
like that

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
so

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
i think we could actually if we want we

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,240
could consider august 15 1997 at

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,800
our birthday and uh

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
it actually

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
the

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
that day is actually corresponding to

102
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,479
the meeting in the

103
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
summer

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
so it's wednesday tomorrow

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
so

106
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,280
we can say that we made

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
25 years and we are going strongly into

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
the next whatever it will be 25 years

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
um okay that was it

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280

and i want to wish it another

117
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
okay

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
i'll have to run a little bit faster

120
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
so let me progress uh to the next slide

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
and unless you i still see you raising

122
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
your hand lower but let me know

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,039

124
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,120
so this is the usual time where we

125
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
present the note well

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
uh

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
which um many may already have been

128
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
acquainted but for those who don't know

129

um you're encouraged to read

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
the best current practices

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
about contributions and

133
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
collab

134
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
participation at itf

135
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
so

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
please go through it if you haven't done

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,719
that already

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,319
um a bit of administrative uh pointers

139
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
uh we do have an mpls working group wiki

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
uh we encourage you to visit that

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
uh it has informative information about

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,560
the

143
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
activities that the working group is

144
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
working on we also have a github

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
page so we do

146
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
once in a while use it

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,479
and we we plan to continue to use that

148
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
we have a

149
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,120
a decent agenda with six items today

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
including the intro by the chairs

151
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
i am hoping that people who have not

152
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
submitted their slides

153
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,599
have the slides ready so when time comes

154
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
i can give them the

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,599
the ball for them to share their uh

156
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,039
slides

157
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
so those who don't uh who have not

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,880
uploaded the slides know themselves

159
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
uh we do have two errata's reported

160
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,319
since last time we met the first one is

161
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,360
pretty straightforward i think it

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
the authors

163
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
dropped

164
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,199
the rro ipv6 sub-object from the

165
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
sentence although they meant say two

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
flags

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
so i think this is

168
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,919
been taken care of by our ad

169
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,520
and it's an accepted

170
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
the next erata is

171
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
is against rfc 3031. uh there is a claim

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,840
that the u usage of the tur of the

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
uh

174
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
of the abbreviation l1 l2 and l3 may be

175
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
confused with

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,639
for labels mpls labels may be confused

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,879
with layer one two and three

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
uh discussed that with uh my co-chairs

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
and uh we did agree that

180
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,840
um uh with 25 years i'm not sure how

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,879
many years

182
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
for our rfc 3031 it's been alive and

183
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
people are by now

184
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
are very well acquainted with what l1 l2

185
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,120
l3 means in the context of rfc 3031

186
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
so

187
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,120
this is not too much of a

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
an issue

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,200
i do want the flag in terms of

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
document status update and since last

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
time we meant

192
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
we do have one rfc

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
and we thank all the working group and

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
the authors who contributed uh on this

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,959
to make it uh an rfc

196
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,399
um

197
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
we have an rfc which is

198
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
stuck in miss ref right now and

199
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,080
uh i checked the uh

200
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
uh the the mishra pointer it's pointing

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
to a draft that has expired

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
i know the i'm not sure if there is a

203
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,279
co-author

204
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,279
present that want to comment on that but

205
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
i know one the main author is in a way

206
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
so we'll have to follow up on that

207

and feel free law to intervene if you

208

know if you know of an update on that

209
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,440
um in terms of new working group

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
documents so the working group was

211
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,959

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,839
documents that got adopted

214

expired

230
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,200

documents we saw we left the status for

234
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,560
uh so hi everyone uh my name is rakesh

267
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
gandhi and presenting the draft on the

268
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
mpls iom on behalf of the co-authors

269
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
listed

270
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,800
next slide please

271
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,959
next slide please

272
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,440
so agenda is a

273
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
quite simple requirements and scope the

274
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
summary and the next step

275
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
and next slide please

276
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
so requirements and the scope of this

277
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,720
draft uh basically is to transport the

278
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
iom data fields with mpls encapsulation

279
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
so in scope is the work that's being

280
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
done in the ippm

281
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
working group

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
so the first draft the iom data is in

283
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,639
rfc now i think it's rfc 9197 i believe

284
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
then the next one is for direct export

285
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,160
but irrespective of the data fields

286
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
here the the scope is on the

287
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
encoding or end cap

288
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,440
on the mpls side

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
and cover both the edge to edge as well

290
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,240
as the hop by hop iom

291
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
cases

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,479
next slide please

293
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,000
so draft has been around for a few years

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
now uh used to be in spring it was moved

295
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,920
to mpls

296
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
uh about a year and a half ago we had

297
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
mplsrt expert review

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
we received good comments including the

299
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,279
gas channel for iom

300
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
and this was just before the m a work

301
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,600
that got started

302
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
since then

303
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,920
the

304
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
encoding

305
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
of the end cap has changed

306
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
a few times

307
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
this one is the latest encoding uh

308
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,240
that's um

309
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,760
in the drop jacks mpls mna header uh so

310
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
we'll just review that encoding uh today

311
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
and next slide this

312
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
so uh the m a and indicators uh

313
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,120
basically as defined in the direct

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
jackson draft this morning that was

315
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,360
presented in pulse

316
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,120
there is a bit a flag in the ttl

317
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,079
in the next lse after the m a label

318
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,360
which is the

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
special purpose label

320
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,480
that indicates that there is um

321
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
post tech data present and

322
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
if there is a need to process

323
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
it hop by hop then there is another flag

324
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,360
for it

325
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,920
next type this

326
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,399
so as mentioned uh

327
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
there are two flags defined in the ttl

328
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,600
field

329
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,320
and in case of n2n iom there are

330
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
option types that's defined for that

331
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,320
in the ippm documents are

332
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
applicable and for hub by hop there are

333
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
also option types defined

334
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,720
for that

335
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
are applicable uh in these two cases

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,959
and next slide please

337
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
so as mentioned as part of the mpls rt

338
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,079
expert review suggestion was to use

339
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,600
iaiom gas channel

340
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,759
to carry the iom option types

341
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
so this is the encoding uh it would look

342
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
like basically all i am data fields

343
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
with the the header that's defined

344
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
slide please

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,519
so the complete packet with encoding

346
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
defined in this draft there is an mna

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
label the special purpose label

348
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
uh in the next lse there are two

349
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,759
flags defined in ttl

350
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
and post-tech data basically the iom

351
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
data fields

352
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
next slide please

353
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,320
so the procedure wise the encap node

354
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,680
will add the iom data the option type

355
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
and the indicator so which is the m a

356
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
label and the flags

357
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,360
in case i went

358
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,000
edge to edge there is a flag bni flag

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
because the hub by half flag is not set

360
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,519
in the m a the intermediate nodes will

361
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
skip the iom processing

362
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,639
uh

363
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
and as uh is the case with mna

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
that the mne header needs to be received

365
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,639
by the decap node that contains the

366
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,920
those flags

367
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
in the header

368
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,519
and basically d-cab node will process

369
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,440
the iom it may point the data iom data

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
to the slow path

371
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
and it will remove the iom data fields

372
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
and the mna header

373
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,800
and next slide please

374
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
so only difference in hub by hub case is

375
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
that there is a new flag set for it and

376
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,319
the intermediate nodes will see it and

377
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,880
it will process the iom data

378
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
from the posttec data

379
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,119
option types

380
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,918
next slide please

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,679
so next steps basically welcome your

382
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,720
comments and suggestions

383
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,679
there is some good

384
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,599
feedback for the

385
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,160
mpls extension header draft

386
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,039
that

387
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,240
hyu presented this morning uh so we do

388
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,919
have a gas base posttech data defined

389
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,120
um

390
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
it probably makes sense to use the

391
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
extension header as a common header uh

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,559
assuming that's what the working group

393
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
consensus or acceptances

394
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
this can be done as part of the working

395
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
you process

396
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,320
but if you have any feedback and

397
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,600
suggestion on that please let us know

398
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,960
and in the end

399
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
we are requesting a working group

400
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
adoption for this trial

401
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
i think that's all i had uh thanks thank

402
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
you

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
thank you yes we have greg in the queue

404
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,400
go ahead greg

405
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,640
um

406
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,960
because it will be embarrassing

407
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
to me

408
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
um

409
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
okay so um

410
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,880
i have a couple questions uh first

411
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
um

412
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,880
rfc 5586 uh

413
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
defines uh

414
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,400
gach4 only to be used on oam packets so

415
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
it's not to be used on the data packets

416
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
so that makes it problematic of applying

417
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,679
iam to the data packets which is i

418
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,120
understand it intention

419
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,600
second of all i have a question so you

420
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
suggest to support

421
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,039
all trace options defined in iem data

422
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,720
draft

423
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
incremental and pre-allocated

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
so you know that uh pre-allocated it's

425
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
basically when

426
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
each transit node adds data

427
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
to the packet

428
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,200
i think that's a very serious impact on

429
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
performance

430
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
and

431
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
i would be

432
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
very much concerned about that to be

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,320
supported in mpos

434
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,000
i believe that it's

435
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,280
[Music]

436
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,480
not useful

437
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
option for npls so maybe in some other

438
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,400
environments

439
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
it's useful but in mpls especially since

440
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
it's uh

441
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
beneficial but not required options so

442
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,679
uh it's something that concerns me

443
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,240
and second of all your request to

444
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
working group adoption is not clear

445
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,440
because

446
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
you're proposing a particular

447
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
encapsulation which

448
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,320
cannot be used on data packets so that

449
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
makes this solution that you are

450
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
proposing

451
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
not

452
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,879
realizable

453
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,760
yes so uh

454
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,000
on the line as well so go ahead rakesh

455
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
now we can hear you for sure

456
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,039
okay

457
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
uh thanks uh greg for the

458
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
um so gsch

459
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
recommendation came from the mplsrt

460
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,919
expert i do agree that in 5586 it's

461
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,440
mentioned it's not for the pro or the

462
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,679
for the data traffic that

463
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,799
that

464
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,520
iom being used so there isn't we

465
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
mentioned in the draft that this is an

466
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,919
issue

467
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,640
and if you recommend or if you

468
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
think that the the

469
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
highest draft extension header is the

470
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
right approach

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,640
for course data encoding then

472
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,039
that is one suggestion that we could

473
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,200
take as a next step

474
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
um yes thank you

475
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
i don't know what the

476
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
community will decide which solution to

477
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,039
accept and standardize

478
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,240
i hope that we'll decide to standardize

479
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
single solution

480
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
which one it will be it's

481
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
yet to discuss but yes i i think that

482
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,200
since iam is one of the use cases for

483
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
mna in the document that working group

484
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
adopted i i hope that

485
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
it will use their solution that working

486
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,080
group adopt for mma

487
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
yeah and currently as you know there is

488
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,159
only one proposal uh that's the highway

489
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,559
drop for post like data encoding and

490
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,799
that seems to be good

491
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
it's not controversial so at least at

492
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
this point unless there's another

493
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
proposal cuts it's like

494
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,679
right next time

495
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,280
welcome the suggestions

496
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,559
um

497
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,039
okay my understanding of proposed

498
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,960
solutions is different but if the

499
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
working group already converges on how

500
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
you proposal for post-tech encapsulation

501
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,280
it's very good news

502
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,039
yeah thanks

503
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,919
thank you um i am next in the queue my

504
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
question hopefully is very quick rakesh

505
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,640
is there any additional validation that

506
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
the ingress will have to do

507
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
before triggering this uh

508
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,480
action be it edge to edge or uh hop by

509
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,840
hop like capability check uh

510
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
specifically the edge to edge does it

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,120
have to check if the

512
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,559
egress is capable of

513
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,200
processing the extra header

514
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
or even the action timestamping thanks

515
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,039
yeah definitely there is a capability um

516
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
signaling is required from egress and if

517
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,919
up by up then

518
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,360
up as well

519
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,240
and this is uh either part of the mna

520
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
capability signaling or there is also uh

521
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
quite a bit of work going on with

522
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,960
i-feet and other uh pce based signaling

523
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
as well for that capability

524
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,000
but yeah there is uh definitely to avoid

525
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
dropping the packets so we do need the

526
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,200
capability signaling

527
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,520
thank you

528
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,880
um

529
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,960
i don't see anyone else in the queue

530
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
so thank you rakesh i'll move

531
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
on thank you

532
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,679
thank you

533
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,240
and next i have is

534
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,159
my camera

535
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,320
on mpls

536
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
mldp extensions for multi-topology

537
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,840
routing

538
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
i think we can go to the next slide

539
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
okay one moment

540
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,799
you guys can hear

541
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,880
okay yeah i can hear you my camera thank

542
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
you

543
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
so just to give a little background that

544
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,159
this draft we presented in iatf 181

545
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,279
and it has

546
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
been adopted very recently

547
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
and

548
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,960
it this draft has been in fact

549
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
implemented and deployed and i think

550
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,720
there were some comments which we wanted

551
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,880
to kind of bring out here

552
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,919
we can go to the next slide

553
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,279
so one of the comment was

554
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,799
how to handle reserve bits and initially

555
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
we had written it as a should be zero

556
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,960
and the command from working group was

557
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
to make it as a must be g road on

558
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
transmission and ignored

559
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
on the received side and i think that is

560
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
fair enough and unless anyone has any

561
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
other

562
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,880
option about this i think we are okay

563
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
with that yeah we can go to the next

564
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
slide

565
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,320
another comment was about can we make it

566
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,559
as a two draft where mldp extension for

567
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,679
igps which is like i t empty field is

568
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,559
separate and for flex algorithm but i

569
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
don't think we

570
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
we don't think that maybe a good option

571
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,720
are really needed because there may not

572
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,600
be a deployment where you really want to

573
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,919
have empty as well as on top of it flex

574
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,799
elbow

575
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
so you will be using either of them and

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,559
maybe that was the reason i don't have

577
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,120
historical reason 10 years back why

578
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
it started with two different draft and

579
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,279
then we finally decided to merge it so i

580
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,279
think we would like to go

581
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,000
with the way it is currently implemented

582
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,720
and the way the draft is

583
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,600
so that's all if and i would like a

584
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
working group to provide comment

585
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,799
and

586
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
i think by the next idf we would like to

587
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
go for working group last call

588
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,919
considering

589
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
it is implemented

590
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,840
unless there is some more comment or

591
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
some more discussion which is required

592
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,679
we have uh lower in the queue and go

593
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,080
ahead though

594
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,919
so

595
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
it's lower why are you waiting for the

596
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,880
next meeting

597
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,400
i'm just waiting in case people have

598
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,480
some comment otherwise from our side

599
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
from the other side we are okay for last

600
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
couple let's say let's say they have to

601
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
give you the comments on october 1st and

602
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,360
then we go ahead

603
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
we don't need need to tie this to a

604
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,159
meeting

605
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
okay yeah sure so we are ready for last

606
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
call for this trap

607
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,000
okay yeah okay you just send out the

608
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,360
mail and say that you you even ask for

609
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
starting the

610
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
publication procedure

611
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
after october 1st

612
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
but you send out the mail

613
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,000
thank you

614
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
okay we don't have

615
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
anyone else in the queue

616
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
uh so thank you my coming up i'll move

617
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,640
on

618
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,720
i have

619
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
uh

620
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,039
i have the next one is uh

621
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
deprecating the use of route alert and

622
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,799
lsb bing

623
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,360
and the presenter is kiriti

624
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,039
um

625
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,760
i don't see your slides in the list to

626
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,799
be shared

627
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,600
uh kiriti so let me see if you're

628
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
available

629
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,799
let me start by asking kiriti if he has

630
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
any slides to share or how does he want

631
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
to tackle that

632
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
i do see you walking to the mic yep he's

633
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
going so

634
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,600
i'm at the bike

635
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,399
um

636
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,960
so i do not have slides i was hoping

637
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,760
that maybe ron had uploaded the slides

638
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,399
i can give an update of where

639
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,000
closer okay

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
so i can give an update of where we

641
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
stand with respect to this

642
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,919
in the document in the lsp ping document

643
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,039
we had

644
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,279
um several modes

645
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,440
and one of the modes is

646
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
that we want to be able to

647
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
return the

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
the ping

649
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
the reply

650
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
via control channel

651
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
and it's not clear at the time why we

652
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
did that

653
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
um i think there was some concern that

654
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
if you return it over

655
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,799
another lsp or something

656
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,000
uh and you're you know debugging lsps

657
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
that would be a problem

658
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,559
so we so we introduced that mode and

659
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,440
then

660
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,679
um and then we said oh to make sure that

661
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,720
happens

662
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,279
let's make make the packet go up to the

663
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
control plane at every hop

664
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,240
so that's one use of router alert

665
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
the other was to make sure that the

666
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,159
reply or the original message

667
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,840
doesn't make it past the end of the

668
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,960
mpls domain

669
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
and somehow get injected into

670
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,799
traffic outside of that

671
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,919
and

672
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,399
we have several ways of doing that

673
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,720
so we don't need to do a

674
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,600
router alert for that

675
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
one uh

676
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
one point was uh brought out

677
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
that in uh

678
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,919
so the way we do that is we set the

679
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,880
destination address in ipv4

680
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
to 127 slash

681
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,399
um i'm trying to think eight

682
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,799
127.00

683
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,880
no 127 slash eight

684
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
and

685
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,960
unfortunately in in ipv6

686
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
there is not a whole subnet that you can

687
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
use similarly there's a single

688
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,559
address i think it's colon colon one

689
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
which which is something that greg had

690
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,080
pointed out

691
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,520
um so

692
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
that's a little bit of a restriction but

693
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
at the same time you know it's in we set

694
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
the ttl to one we we set a bunch of

695
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,640
things so that the packet won't you know

696
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,919
go beyond the last uh mpls router

697
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,360
and so

698
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
the idea was let's just deprecate

699
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,120
doctor alert

700
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,520
and that's the direction that uh

701
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,440
ipv6 guys want to go independent of

702
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
uh you know what we're doing here for

703
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
lsd bing

704
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
so um modulo this one comment

705
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,279
um i think this draft is ready to go

706
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,000
uh in terms of you know at least to do a

707
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,279
working

708
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,360
working group adoption

709
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
and then you know if we have to iron out

710
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
a few things okay

711
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
but then you know we want to get to the

712
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
next level where we

713
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
we say this is um

714
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that whole approach

715
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,399
of having a router alert

716
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,519
in lsd ping packets should go away

717
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,799
um and

718
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,720
of course between the working group

719
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,080
adoption call

720
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,320
and working group glasgow

721
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
we need to make sure that no one's

722
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,600
actually using this

723
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
and that's our feeling

724
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,279
but you know i think we need to give

725
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,960
people time to say

726
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,200
have they actually implemented

727
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
lsb ping

728
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
with uh router alert

729
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,919
so that's basically where this uh draft

730
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,720
stands and i'm sorry i don't have slides

731
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
but that's a that's a summary of this

732
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,480
okay thank you kiriti we have people

733
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,679
in the queue for asking questions uh

734
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,559
and uh let me ask laura to go ahead

735
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,840
so hello kiriti uh

736
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,799
actually the point with this draft is

737
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,760
that

738
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,120
you presented it once before

739
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
and you are asking for working group

740
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
adoption

741
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,240
and we didn't have one single reaction

742
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
on the mailing list

743
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
so you your task is to actually make

744
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
sure that you have a discussion that can

745
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,399
motivate

746
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,840
make it the working group document

747
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,399
thanks okay

748
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,799
i mean we can start a thread so

749
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,559
we'll do that yeah please please do

750
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,600
okay

751
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,799
okay

752
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,240
um zafar you're next

753
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
yeah there is a farley

754
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,120
uh so you mentioned that the ipv6 group

755
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
is also going in that direction could

756
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
you elaborate a little bit more because

757
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
i think there's an individual draft but

758
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,760
no discussion i i could be wrong on that

759
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
so i don't know the details of what's

760
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,760
happening in ipv6 but there was a

761
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,320
movement in the ipv6

762
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
um

763
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,760
six man

764
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,279
six men yeah

765
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,720
saying um you know we we want to

766
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
um get rid of

767
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,640
uh router alert

768
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
and i think in general they want to

769
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
make sure that the extension headers

770
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,559
that are being used

771
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,799
are ones that you know actually are

772
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,519
being used and will go forward

773
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,720
so i don't i'm not a regular attendee of

774
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,919
six man

775
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,880
so that's more of a side comment uh i

776
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
mean whatever we decide here

777
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
uh we'll have some influence there but

778
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,159
uh you know really

779
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,799
if we are not using it whatever

780
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,320
six man is doing

781
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,360
if nobody is in has implemented

782
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,240
uh lsd ping with the router alert option

783
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
either in v4 or v6

784
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,919
we should just take it out of the

785
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,320
document

786
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,799
yeah let's have a discussion on the main

787
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
list but you mentioned about the survey

788
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,760
i think the survey will be important

789
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,199
thank you

790
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,839
thank you um incorrect you're next

791
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,159
thanks

792
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
hi i'm gregory erickson um

793
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,359
as committee pointed out so uh there is

794
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
a

795
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,679
problem with the ipv6

796
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,359
address being

797
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,480
documented in lspp

798
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,000
and i think that

799
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,599
we might use this

800
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,280
work

801
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
it doesn't have to be due as an

802
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,760
individual draft but in the course of

803
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,040
their progressing into publication

804
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,320
to

805
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,199
fix this problem and then fix a

806
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,079
recommendation that basically

807
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
suggests to use a destination address as

808
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
an entropy

809
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,640
but instead of that given the fact we

810
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,119
have single address in ipv6 for the

811
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
loopback i recommend you use the source

812
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
udp port number as an entropy

813
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,200
but it's something for discussion thank

814
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
you

815
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,720
thank you

816
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
okay um no one else in the queue so

817
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,079
thank you kiriti but i'll double check i

818
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,040
think you are next cell so please

819
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,599
stand the ground and i'll switch the

820
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,000
slides

821
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,939
[Music]

822
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
okay yeah thanks

823
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
so um

824
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
so let me switch to this one

825
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,720
um in in this document we've proposed

826
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,480
a a registry an iana registry for what

827
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
we are calling the mpls first nibble

828
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,440
which is

829
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,400
the first four bits after the last

830
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
label the label with a

831
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
end of stack bit set

832
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,040
so so we're up to division o2 here

833
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,520
and this is joint work with uh stuart

834
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,400
bryant matthew bocce greg mursky and

835
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
lowe anderson

836
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,480
next

837
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,920
so there's been quite a bit of

838
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,200
discussion

839
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
on this

840
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,119
not so much on the open mpls list but in

841
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,520
the design team

842
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,320
and i think there was some concern

843
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
is this trying to replicate the ipv4

844
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
version number registry

845
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,200
um you know what is the goal here

846
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
and the goal here is to say

847
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,440
we've we've had a couple of

848
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,680
code points that we've put

849
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,400
that we use for for example the

850
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,560
pseudo-wire control word or the net

851
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,520
control word or the beer header

852
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,680
and we just said okay we'll use zero for

853
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
this we actually use zero for both

854
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,520
survivor control word and that next

855
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,320
control word and then we use i forget

856
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,720
what two or one or two for the beer

857
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,160
header

858
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,880
but these are sort of um just allocated

859
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,160
and

860
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
basically everyone just says avoid four

861
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,560
and six and then you're good

862
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,240
but i think it's a lot clearer if you

863
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,200
have a registry so we're looking at this

864
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,839
control words and the beer header as

865
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,480
early instances of what we are now

866
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,640
calling post-stack data

867
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,800
and so we're saying it would be good to

868
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
have a registry where we have all of

869
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,480
this

870
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
so that kind of um answers the question

871
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
why a registry

872
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,280
the other part

873
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,359
that there was some confusion is

874
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,920
does this registry mimic the ip version

875
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
registry and the answer is very clearly

876
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,640
no

877
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
we avoid four and six

878
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,480
but if tomorrow there's an ip version

879
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
seven

880
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,760
uh the psv could also have version i'm

881
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
sorry this um first nibble registry

882
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,760
could also also have an entry for seven

883
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,560
and

884
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,520
if you follow the recommendations in the

885
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
document

886
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
there will not be confusion between ip

887
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,040
version 7 packets

888
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,279
and

889
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
you know pseudo wire sorry

890
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,599
post stack data

891
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,480
so the recommendation here is you can

892
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,560
send a packet that's a native ipv4

893
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,880
or a native ipv6 packet without vsd

894
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,599
any other packet must have

895
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,560
some form of full stack data

896
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
in other words there are existing rfcs

897
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,720
that say you must have

898
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,440
for ethernet pseudo wires you must have

899
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,119
a control word

900
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,320
the idea there being you don't confuse

901
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,400
that ethernet packet with an ipv4 packet

902
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,640
so so that's sort of the third point

903
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,440
here

904
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,680
we want to mandate

905
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,960
a psd or control word or something

906
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
that doesn't start with four and six for

907
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,880
all non-ip actually more accurately

908
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,040
all non-ipv4 or ipv6 packets

909
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,160
now can we mandate this we already have

910
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,440
an rfc that says at least for ethernet

911
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,480
pseudo-wires that you must have it

912
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,200
um but you can't mandate it in the sense

913
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
there are implementations that don't do

914
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,400
this

915
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
you can rot them across the knuckles you

916
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
can do various things the providers who

917
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,000
have this

918
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
should understand that they're

919
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
opening themselves up to packet

920
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,160
reordering and other kinds of trouble

921
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,520
but you know

922
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,760
all we can do is set the rules and

923
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,520
people can decide whether they want to

924
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,760
follow them or not

925
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
the other thing the last one that's a

926
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,000
bit more controversial

927
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
is

928
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,599
should the fact that there is psd in the

929
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,720
packet

930
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
be in the control chain

931
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,599
so for example with pseudo wires

932
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,359
you say in the control plane whether

933
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,599
you're going to insert a control word or

934
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,440
not

935
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,680
or should be in the data plane and so

936
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,000
many of the mna

937
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
proposals say there's a bit

938
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,359
in you know the moral equivalent of the

939
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,680
fbi special purpose label

940
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,200
that says there is psv in the packet

941
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
or should be both

942
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,230
and

943
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,520
[Music]

944
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
i think stuart put it

945
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,359
in this way that he doesn't like the

946
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,920
belt and suspenders approach

947
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
um you know i think that's something

948
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
that the

949
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,319
working group

950
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,240
should um should decide

951
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,480
that you know there is signaling in the

952
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,720
control plane but maybe it's all it's

953
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,440
nice to also have signaling or indicator

954
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
in the data plane so that when you're

955
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,599
passing it um you you don't make a

956
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,640
mistake

957
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,400
so these are the sort of open points

958
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,119
next slide

959
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,400
so

960
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,920
um i think

961
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
you know that discussion that we had and

962
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,560
some of it was pretty vigorous in the

963
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,000
design team

964
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,599
needs to happen in the mprs working

965
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,200
group at large

966
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,319
but i think the questions to ask are is

967
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,319
this stuff useful

968
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,000
but does it belong in the itf does it

969
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,079
belong in mpls

970
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,599
and then is this a good enough starting

971
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,359
point for working group adoption i mean

972
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,920
there's definitely a lot of things to

973
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
to fill in and to clarify

974
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,560
but you know are we at a position that

975
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,680
we should do

976
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,000
working group adoption or should we have

977
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
more discussion in the in the

978
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
mailing list

979
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,070
that's kind of where we are

980
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,040
[Music]

981
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,319
and i think that's the last slide

982
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,560
okay

983
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,200
yeah i have a question please uh so with

984
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,520
signaling um it's a little bit i

985
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,640
understand if you signal in advance

986
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,880
uh you know i i will be sending you a

987
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
control word uh

988
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
and then you start sending traffic after

989
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,200
and that's a kind of a static state that

990
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,160
you're in

991
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,560
that all your flow or all your packets

992
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,400
from ingress to egress will

993
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,480
contain the control word and that's

994
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
understandable but when you're doing on

995
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,720
demand type of

996
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,079
thing

997
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,200
where you enable

998
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,599
you know

999
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,760
you're saying here a control word i can

1000
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,520
give a different example you enable

1001
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,119
something but then

1002
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,520
your flow is already started so some

1003
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,640
packets may carry that or some

1004
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,800
some packets may not and there will be a

1005
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,960
timing issue between control plane and

1006
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,480
the data packets so we cannot correlate

1007
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,599
when the state is uh ready for

1008
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,720
you know uh

1009
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,119
control work being present at that time

1010
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:49,920
so

1011
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,720
i'm not sure yeah that's signaling i

1012
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
mean there is advantages in getting

1013
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,319
carrying it in the data plane in that

1014
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,760
sense

1015
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,720
yeah clear guys do that as well so

1016
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,599
um

1017
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
even though they have a lot of signaling

1018
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,119
in the control plane

1019
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
in the data plane they have a

1020
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,000
special purpose label that says i have a

1021
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,440
beer

1022
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,160
you know beer data which comes after the

1023
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,599
stack so basically they have brpsd

1024
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,640
but that's

1025
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,920
heralded

1026
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,280
by a special purpose label so we do both

1027
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,440
like the control words

1028
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,280
for that net and pseudo wires are

1029
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
signaled in the control plane but not

1030
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,480
the data plane

1031
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,720
in beer we do both

1032
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,680
and then

1033
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,520
as you said there may be cases where

1034
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,200
it's more ad hoc

1035
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,960
and so you'll have things that are

1036
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
signaled in the data plane but not in

1037
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,040
the control control plane so i think

1038
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
that's something that we need to think

1039
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,599
about

1040
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,599
and see from an implementation point of

1041
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,560
view

1042
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
as well as a you know make sure we're

1043
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,240
doing the right thing with the packets

1044
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,440
point of view

1045
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
what is the approach we want to take

1046
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,280
okay

1047
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,400
there isn't any other question

1048
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,480
so i will

1049
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,560
proceed move on and thank you kiriti

1050
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,880
i think the last presentation for today

1051
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
uh

1052
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,599
so i do have i think uh

1053
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
either robin or

1054
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,680
chuang long

1055
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,839
uh i will shy okay

1056
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,640
okay and do you want uh controlled uh

1057
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,359
flip between slides i'm giving you

1058
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,720
i don't do nothing

1059
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
you can control it

1060
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,520
okay

1061
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,880
uh hello everyone my name is

1062
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,119
from huawei and today my topic to

1063
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,599
generalize the ipv6 town of mps

1064
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,319
let's start please

1065
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,640
okay

1066
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,200
uh we know some technique on challenges

1067
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,480
to mps

1068
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,000
uh first one is the amherst legs the

1069
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,720
mechanism of source education

1070
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,400
for mp2p connections this causes the

1071
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
difficulty and the complexity for omo or

1072
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,599
mps

1073
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,119
we know that also the sfl is defined

1074
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,640
but a few

1075
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,960
implementations

1076
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,599
and the second the type of pillow out

1077
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,280
cannot be directly determined because

1078
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,839
no pilate type indication

1079
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,720
and the third we know the mps is

1080
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
difficult to encapsulate new forwarding

1081
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,960
attributes

1082
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,560
for the new features

1083
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,400
such as the net spacing i feed and ep

1084
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,079
and so on

1085
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,720
and first the first

1086
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,560
the process of

1087
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,160
the esmp function is in complexity and

1088
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,440
we know the interfacible or flow level

1089
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,640
are usually placed at the bottom of the

1090
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,960
labor stack for processing

1091
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
and the internet behind the information

1092
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,000
may also be impossible for the purpose

1093
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,960
of the example

1094
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,119
okay last slide please

1095
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,640
uh before i

1096
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,400
progress from long would you like to

1097
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,560
take questions now or towards the end

1098
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,800
do you like to think

1099
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,680
uh

1100
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,839
sorry

1101
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,800
um

1102
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,440
i have greg wants to ask a question do

1103
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,200
you like to take it now or towards land

1104
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,119
do you like to uh take the questions

1105
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,319
was that's the video

1106
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
okay i see greg already at the mic why

1107
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,280
don't you go ahead greg and ask your

1108
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,880
questions okay thank you um uh can you

1109
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,040
clarify what you've seen the difficulty

1110
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,480
complexity of oem over mpls

1111
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,240
if i understand correctly for the

1112
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,640
multi-point to point

1113
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,440
connection i mean maybe in the next

1114
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,599
steps i can give them more detailed

1115
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,960
information

1116
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,280
okay

1117
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,240
okay are you okay to hold uh greg

1118
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
okay i can hold

1119
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,000
okay thank you thank you

1120
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
please proceed

1121
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,160
okay

1122
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,960
so next slice okay

1123
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,920
hit number three

1124
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,280
okay

1125
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,559
and

1126
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,599
you know in the drafted jp6 draft

1127
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,040
defines

1128
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,920
the jp6 tunnel how to support the new

1129
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
features

1130
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,240
for example iom and ipn

1131
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,440
under the exiting functions for the ip

1132
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,160
tunnels based on the extensions to the

1133
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,800
ipv6 extension headers

1134
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,119
the right figure is showing the cab

1135
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,440
solution or jp6

1136
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,800
in this figure we can find the ipv6

1137
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,359
extension hydra includes the

1138
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,839
cab solutions of new features

1139
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,720
and

1140
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,400
absolutions of exiting tunnels functions

1141
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,240
this is the jp6

1142
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,400
the in-cab solution

1143
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,640
if the jp6 tunnel is used for mps

1144
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,079
there can be the following advantages

1145
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,760
the first is the ipv6 source address is

1146
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,440
used to do for more sourcing additives

1147
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,119
and the second

1148
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,559
the ipv6

1149
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,640
uh that's kinda can

1150
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,599
indicate the payload type

1151
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,640
and the third is the ipv6 flow label

1152
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,000
can are used for the smp

1153
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,040
and the last one is the in-cab solutions

1154
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,079
for the new features have been defined

1155
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,599
well in the ipv6 and can be reused

1156
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
easily

1157
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,759
next step please

1158
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,009
[Music]

1159
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,489
[Music]

1160
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,920
okay

1161
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,960
and in order to support the mps

1162
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,200
based on the jp tunnel the method

1163
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,280
carrier ms label stick

1164
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,720
information is defined as follows

1165
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,400
pressure all well known ipv6 profiles

1166
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,640
need to be assigned

1167
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,480
and then encapsulation the ms label

1168
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,520
and the

1169
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,640
second is the ipv6 pressure prefix

1170
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,079
can be followed by maple the mps label

1171
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,319
in cap solutions to form

1172
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,280
120 bits

1173
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,800
we quickly call it the ipv6 nps state

1174
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,160
and type one

1175
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,400
this is the following figure shows the

1176
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,960
details from it

1177
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,079
okay next slides please

1178
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,440
okay the ipv6 empire said can be placed

1179
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,880
in the ibvs distinction advice and how

1180
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,359
to process the first label when the

1181
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,200
packet is received

1182
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,240
see this figure to the local action of

1183
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,400
the label one is pop

1184
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
then properly for one and

1185
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,839
label two label three are moved left

1186
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,680
to uh number left by 32 bits

1187
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,359
if you look

1188
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,119
label one swipe

1189
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,760
then replace the enable one with new

1190
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,960
label

1191
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,400
yeah next thread please

1192
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,680
okay uh if all the empty labels type

1193
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,880
cannot be placed in the ipv6 distinction

1194
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,839
device

1195
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,160
ipv6 the hydra can be used to host the

1196
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,200
remaining has mps labor stake

1197
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,599
in this figure is defined ibv6 amputated

1198
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,359
we call it the type 2

1199
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,680
and the next multiple label cab

1200
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,000
solutions

1201
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,520
the type 2

1202
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,559
it is used as the segment

1203
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,319
in the root hider

1204
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,720
after all of the label income solutions

1205
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,680
in the ipv6 distinction address are

1206
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,040
profit

1207
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,400
the first label in the segment indicated

1208
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,000
by the asylum will be protest

1209
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,400
next please

1210
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,440
uh some considerations about the control

1211
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,559
plan

1212
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,359
first of all the jp6 only processor the

1213
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,640
way to carry mps label cab solutions in

1214
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,319
the data plan

1215
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,480
and the amps can travel and actually

1216
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,960
need to be changed so

1217
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,640
i missed the label

1218
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,000
can still be

1219
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,960
distributed using existing control plan

1220
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,800
doesn't change anything

1221
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,839
okay next please

1222
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,359
[Music]

1223
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,040
oh an incumbent

1224
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,440
thank you

1225
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,119
yes greg is uh the top of the cube

1226
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,160
okay thank you okay okay now i have two

1227
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,839
clarification questions uh the first is

1228
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,680
to the first slide where you

1229
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,200
mentioned that

1230
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,760
motivation for this work is

1231
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,160
difficulty in complexity

1232
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,880
using mpos oam

1233
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,000
and second is how in your opinion this

1234
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,079
work is related to

1235
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,480
mpls over udp rfc 7510

1236
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,880
and mpls

1237
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
sr acid impellers or ip

1238
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,879
rfc 8663

1239
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,440
uh

1240
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,960
sorry my level is not a stable uh i

1241
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,280
cannot listen very clear and jamie can

1242
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,280
you help claire for it for me okay jamie

1243
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,480
jimmy do you want to take that

1244
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,079
question

1245
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,480
yeah i can try to

1246
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,520
help to help to answer that one

1247
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,400
i think

1248
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,359
the complexity about the oem for mprs is

1249
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,400
mainly

1250
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,200
uh due to the lack of the source node

1251
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,800
indication in the

1252
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,720
nprs package so that is usual

1253
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,960
document is talking about uh

1254
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,799
as for the ampers over ip and

1255
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,440
udp encapsulation

1256
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,280
um

1257
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,559
my understanding is it is

1258
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,359
a separate thing from the npr's original

1259
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,520
impr's encapsulation so we were

1260
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,839
comparing the npr's absolution with this

1261
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,319
uh new proposal

1262
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,200
here

1263
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,150
okay

1264
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,960
[Music]

1265
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,160
little bit um

1266
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,799
that you say that

1267
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,400
mpls oem packet don't have uh source

1268
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,319
information because

1269
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,480
if we use ipedp encapsulation

1270
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,520
for oem packets as we discussed earlier

1271
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,960
for example in lspping so it does

1272
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,200
include uh ipsource address

1273
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,599
uh yeah that is another encapsulation

1274
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,839
which may help to

1275
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,319
encapsulate the source address but the

1276
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,520
mprs itself does not have this kind of

1277
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,359
uh capability

1278
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,160
yes but it's matter of choice so

1279
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,558
basically yes if you choose

1280
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,960
then you can use sfl

1281
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,400
again so that's already been solved

1282
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
so if you choose non-ip encapsulation

1283
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,440
then you can use sfl

1284
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,920
and sfl so synonymous flow label

1285
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,599
being

1286
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,480
developed as a mechanism to identify the

1287
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,720
source in mpls environment

1288
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,040
yeah that one has also been mentioned in

1289
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,400
the presentation well you can see

1290
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,040
uh sfl is one option it is not uh

1291
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,440
widely implemented or used in the

1292
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,720
network

1293
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,680
uh

1294
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,240
okay but we already have defined and you

1295
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,480
introduce another option that is not

1296
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,280
being implemented by anybody yet

1297
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,920
kind of strange thank you

1298
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,799
okay

1299
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,480
greg please follow up on the mailing

1300
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,799
list

1301
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,880
as well so i'm next in the queue uh

1302
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,599
tarek sad as a working group participant

1303
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:54,400
um

1304
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,040
the as you know the mpls label contains

1305
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,599
an additional in addition to the label

1306
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,880
value

1307
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,920
ttl and traffic class

1308
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,119
fields

1309
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,920
and the ib header as well the ipv6 in

1310
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,599
this case

1311
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,880
contains traffic class and ttl so which

1312
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,680
ones will be respected and

1313
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,200
your in your encoding proposal

1314
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,040
if they're contradictory or different

1315
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,359
so which is it the ipv6 ddl and the

1316
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,359
traffic class or the mpls

1317
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,240
uh hello tarik can i take this question

1318
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,599
yeah sure

1319
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,880
okay tariq i think that's a very good

1320
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,319
very good question in fact this has been

1321
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,559
taken into account

1322
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,119
until now we think that

1323
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,640
in order to maintain the original impr's

1324
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,240
encapsulation

1325
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,160
we recommend that the mprs ttl traffic

1326
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,640
class will be used

1327
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,040
instead of the ipv6 ttl or the

1328
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,240
other

1329
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,640
traffic class that's this is the

1330
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,559
answer until now

1331
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,720
but we thinking maybe in the future

1332
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,839
if possible maybe we only encapsulate

1333
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,760
encapsulate the label value but the ipv6

1334
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,040
ttl

1335
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,480
and

1336
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,599
traffic class can be reused

1337
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,280
but i think that

1338
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,400
means much change

1339
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,280
thank you robin i i was hinting to that

1340
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,599
you know that you know maybe you should

1341
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,839
consider only the label value rather

1342
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,240
than the whole 32 bits

1343
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,440
but

1344
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
the next question i have is why do you

1345
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,599
call it sid i is it srv6

1346
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,119
related

1347
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,559
uh

1348
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,040
in fact yes in fact you use not a ipv6

1349
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,400
address

1350
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,520
but you know that we talked about some

1351
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,880
of the this generalized srv6 i mean

1352
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,160
this is the

1353
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,880
segment that

1354
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,280
encapsulated the impr's label

1355
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,119
so we call it a

1356
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,200
type of this seed

1357
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,160
maybe

1358
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,440
more appropriate

1359
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,040
that's something

1360
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,480
so it is srv6 then

1361
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,839
to some extent that generalize the srv6

1362
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:37,119
because you know that's the classic srv6

1363
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,319
is the segment means the locator plus

1364
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,440
the function plus arguments but here is

1365
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,599
different from the classic

1366
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,040
srv6 segment

1367
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,240
okay i appreciate maybe you clarify that

1368
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,559
in the draft as well

1369
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,559
okay

1370
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,079

1374
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,880
i was i was just going to say i think

1375
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,480
you should change along with what you

1377
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,040
thing you should change the name of the

1378
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,559
draft even shouldn't just clarify it
