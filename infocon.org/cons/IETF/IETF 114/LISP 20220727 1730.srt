1
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,560
okay

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
so welcome everybody to the lisp session

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
working group meeting

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
uh we have a one hour meeting

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,960
the usual note well which you are

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
supposed to have read it

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,119
during your registration

9
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
procedure

10
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
i know you are familiar with every

11
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,840
single line of this not well

12
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,560
few tips for if you are in the room you

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
join the mitiko with the local uh

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
uh tool okay

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,119
uh so that

16
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,040
in this way you can sign the blue sheets

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
also

18
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,878
okay right you can arise your hand if

19
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,080
you want to go to the mic uh okay

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
and

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
wear a mask

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
unless you you are at the mic and you

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
are speaking sometimes is better that

24
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
way otherwise for people that are in

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
remote the usual procedure with mitiga

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
in remote

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
okay

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
this is a

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
slide that we have already the last time

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
i think it's important the code of

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
conduct also

32
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
i keep it

33
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,400
are expected to

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
to treat each other with courtesy which

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
means also to to wear a mask because

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
it's protecting each other okay

37
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
we have technical discussions here not

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
personal discussions

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760

and then you have to click on the pencil

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
icon to switch from just viewing it to

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880

74
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,520
two months that there was quite some

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919

76
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
now in the rfc editor queue

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
which is good news so the beast

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
documents basically are through

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
lisptec

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
okay that

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
was quite some discussions

82
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
on that one

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,479
but yeah we

84
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,120
we seem to to to to ready to actually

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
also unblock some old documents like the

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,360
the introduction document which is

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
stuck in the queue for uh i don't know

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
how long uh

89
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,919
anymore but now with the

90
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,400
the the beast document going through we

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,759
should be good

92
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,479
is there any uh

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
means you're almost done

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
what you've got what you've got in front

95
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
of you is when they get to it the rf rpc

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
the production center will do their job

97
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,319
when they are done they will send to you

98
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,000
an email that says auth48 here's what we

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
did to your document

100
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
please review and approve there is a

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
list of questions please answer them

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,800
do so promptly please

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
i've had authors in other contexts

104
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
that they are work by the editors but

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
they they have occasionally noticed wait

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
you said x here and why there what did

107
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
you mean

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,039
so it's mostly editorial but they're

109
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
very sharp and they they occasionally

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,440
spot other things

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,479
that's why answer the questions is

112
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,080
important and

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
god we've spent long enough on this

114
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
luigi has done more work i mean my

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
thanks to luigi he's done a tremendous

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
amount of work

117
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,720
so

118
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
the uh they ask is authors when we hit

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
off 48

120
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,039
please be responsive and looks like the

121
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,800
ad wants to chime in to add to that

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
you gotta find the on switch it's up on

123
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,239
the side of the microphone

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,799
and you gotta slide it all the way up

125
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
so hard to say something

126
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
uh

127
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
no i forgot what i was going to say

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
oh the documents

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
um

130
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,879
keep in mind that

131
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,759
we requested expedited processing for

132
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,720
the whole cluster

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
because at the request of um i

134
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,360
ko right

135
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
and there was no way to request

136
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,279
processing for just two so for the whole

137
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
cluster all seven or eight documents

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,240
so what that means is that please as

139
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
joel said

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
reply to the auth 48 ideally in 48 hours

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,399
i think that's what that's supposed to

142
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,360
mean

143
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
uh so that we can get these documents

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
out because all of them are

145
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
probably going to come out together in

146
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
one block

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
and so we need them to to get out so we

148
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
can

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,720
uh meet what uh iko wants us to do

150
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,330
so between luigi um

151
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,379
[Music]

152
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
to tell the rpc don't worry about

153
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,320
certain authors

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
who've drifted away but we'll we can

155
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
deal with that

156
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,489
[Music]

157
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,959
don't celebrate until it's published

158
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
because you'll actually get the rp

159
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,160
you'll actually know what the rfc number

160
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,800
is

161
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
before it's published yeah sure because

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,640
you'll see it in the auth 48

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
yes good plan

164
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,640
uh

165
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,120
we have another couple of documents that

166
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
they they passed the working group last

167
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
call um

168
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
we're working on that

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
okay the there is the

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
young model i think it was uh already

171
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
mentioned in the last time we

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
we should pay attention to data moving

173
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
it forward i think is

174
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,399
ready or

175
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
or really close to it

176
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,000
okay and then we have a bunch of

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
documents for which

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,839
um

179
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
we need to to to focus on them now that

180
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
the these documents are over or almost

181
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,839
over okay

182
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
that's the next next uh task i would say

183
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,959
uh the agenda for today we have first

184
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,000
the least reliable transport okay mark

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
uh we will

186
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
present that and then we have dino with

187
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
the satellite networks and distinguished

188
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
name encoding

189
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
unless there is any comment on the

190
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,760
agenda

191
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,839
i guess we can move

192
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,720
over okay

193
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
so mark

194
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,789
[Music]

195
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,920
should i run the slides for you yes yeah

196
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,560
okay so

197
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
um we just wanted to provide an update

198
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,279
on the reliable transfer draft now that

199
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,040
it's a working group document

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
i'm mark i'm presenting on behalf of

201
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
list of authors

202
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
next like this

203
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
so in terms of updates what we've done

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,480
is uh yeah we've been integrating all

205
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
the changes that we've been discussing

206
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,839
during the last meetings in this

207
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,279
document

208
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
in particular what we are doing what

209
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,120
we've done is

210
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,839
is provide further details on how do we

211
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,800
do the transition from udp to reliable

212
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
transport

213
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
then

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
also the draft now incorporates the

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
reliable transport bit

216
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
that

217
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,839
drives the understanding between the etr

218
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
and the web server that when when to use

219
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
a reliable transport

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,079
and now the document includes quick as

221
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
an alternative protocol to to use

222
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
for reliable transport and discusses a

223
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
little bit how to select the protocol

224
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
when you have multiple options

225
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
and i reserved the last part of the last

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
slide that you'll see for portal

227
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
locations uh all the discussion that we

228
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
had in the mailing list

229
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
let's see now next slide please

230
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,079
so from udp to reliable transfer uh

231
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
the the idea of that the draft defense

232
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
it's always you must always first

233
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,200
register with you lease udp uh once uh

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,399
successful udp registration has happened

235
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
and that's the only time that you can

236
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,399
switch to reliable transfer

237
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,880
so what we've done in address is clarify

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
how this works right um

239
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,279
in particular and

240
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,920
there is this concept of

241
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
as a security measure the the map server

242
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
should never accept any reliable

243
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
transport session

244
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
it should not even open the possibility

245
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
until at least

246
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
one etr has

247
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,959
registered with udv and has expressed

248
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,639
the intent to switch to reliable

249
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
transport

250
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
once an etr expresses the intent to

251
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,959
switch to reliable transfer that that's

252
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,680
the time when the map server will

253
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,560
put

254
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,600
this etr login in a

255
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
in an acceptance list and that's what

256
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
the only time that

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
from that moment on it will start

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,639
accepting connections from from the ctr

259
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,760
and

260
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
the other thing that the draft specifies

261
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
is whenever the session goes down

262
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
an etr should always switch back to udp

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
before attempting reliable transport

264
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,440
again

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,839
next slide

266
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,320
the second thing that the draft

267
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,279
documents is the

268
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,120
future technology speaking as

269
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
me so there's no grace where we start

270
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,199
uh no

271
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,399
yeah

272
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
yeah the idea was

273
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
to keep things a bit simpler

274
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
just to always go back you know to

275
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
whenever possible right just just

276
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,959
because i mean you're already

277
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
authenticated

278
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,519
and

279
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,199
um

280
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,639
well i don't know

281
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,320
no no i'll go read the first a little

282
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
bit better and ask later

283
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,959
no no that's a good point um

284
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,800
the draft now doesn't consider it but um

285
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
yeah it's a good idea to tonight the

286
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
problem is that you don't know

287
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
whether you have lost the state when

288
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
when whenever there is a problem with a

289
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
reliable transport uh

290
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,240
so the the simpler way that we found was

291
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
to just go back right and restart from

292
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
scratch

293
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
just real quick this is dino i didn't

294
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
understand the question so i don't know

295
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,040
what you're answering oh no

296
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
so the question was um he said that if

297
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
the tc position goes down

298
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,040
then you have to go back and

299
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,560
authenticate again

300
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,360
via udp no you're constantly setting

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
that registers yeah

302
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,440
the authentication data is in the map

303
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,519
register so it's a periodic

304
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
re-authentication so it's not discussion

305
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,040
based

306
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
maybe at the mic okay so uh okay yeah

307
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,880
right make sense

308
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
so

309
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
if you just

310
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
on the mailing list if you could just

311
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
say what what you mean what you're

312
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
thinking about graceful restart then

313
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,079
we'll understand specifically what

314
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,719
you're talking about

315
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
okay so

316
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
the other thing that i've now

317
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
incorporated is the reliable transfer

318
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,320
bit

319
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
this bit is just used

320
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
so that the etr doesn't need doesn't

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
need to guess whether a map server can

322
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,800
accept a reliable transfer establishment

323
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,680
or not

324
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
so the the idea is in the map register

325
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,839
we set this bit whenever an etr

326
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
so that the atr can express intent to

327
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,320
establish a reliable transport uh next

328
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
slide

329
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
and then the maps the map server in the

330
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
notified and said the corresponding

331
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
leads just to

332
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
tell back the edr okay now you can go

333
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,839
ahead and try to establish a reliable

334
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,639
transfer with me

335
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,199
next slide

336
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,119
okay so what the working group document

337
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,039
now incorporates is the list of

338
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
protocols that can be used to establish

339
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,919
the

340
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,160
reliable transfer then as part of this

341
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
list now incorporate quick

342
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,039
to the list as we discussed

343
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,559
in the mailing list um

344
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
one important thing that we've

345
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
incorporated and it would be good if we

346
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
can have a discussion on this but um

347
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
first thing is that for all protocols

348
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
what the draft specifies is that all the

349
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,799
sessions will be long lived right so

350
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,640
once the session established this is

351
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,919
what

352
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,840
uh there is this understanding that the

353
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
state is synchronized between dtr and

354
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
on the map server and this is what

355
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,360
simplifies some processes with reliable

356
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
transport

357
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,120
but the second part is the one that i'm

358
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,440
interested we are interested in hearing

359
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
back is

360
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
as of now the draft specifies that quick

361
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,080
and sad will use a single stream right

362
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
we know that the protocol

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
offers the possibility to

364
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,400
to

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
establish multiple streams between the

366
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
etr and the map server

367
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,360
but since we are using this for a very

368
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
specific interface and very specific

369
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
messages between

370
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,559
etrm observer uh for now the the draft

371
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
just reduces

372
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,840
this to single stream

373
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,919
um if you guys have different experience

374
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,640
and and you think we should upgrade to

375
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
to specify multiple sims we can always

376
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
do that um

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
okay

378
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,520
this

379
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,080
uh this part of the draw the answers uh

380
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,400
dino had a comment on on

381
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
okay now since we have multiple

382
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
protocols uh

383
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,919
how do we choose among them and and what

384
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,320
do we do about the

385
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
potential delay that can come from the

386
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
fact that okay i'm trying one protocol

387
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
maybe this protocol fails

388
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
next protocol comes

389
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
so

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,360
the draft now specifies an order but

391
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,080
just as a suggestion let's say

392
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,559
with a may

393
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
so if the etr can support the three

394
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
protocols this would be the suggested

395
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
order

396
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
but also

397
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
we'll introduce this node saying okay um

398
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,039
since we don't want um

399
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,480
the

400
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
information that mapping information to

401
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
be delayed while we try to establish the

402
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
reliable transport dtr should always

403
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
make sure that it's sending complete

404
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
mapping information in with udp

405
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
while waiting for for the reliable

406
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,360
transport to be established

407
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,760
okay um

408
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
observation i mean if we need a reliable

409
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
transport

410
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
i would choose at least one as

411
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
mandatory to be implemented with this

412
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
draft i mean otherwise

413
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,679
i mean

414
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
just choose one okay my suggestion is

415
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,200
tcp yeah it makes sense so when we have

416
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
now reported

417
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,320
that's a good one uh

418
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,440
about the order uh

419
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
you can suggest a note that i don't

420
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,880
think there is the need to to mandate an

421
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
order in any way because anyway the

422
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
choice is limited so okay

423
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,679
but okay another good one um

424
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
okay yeah we can make tcp mandatory

425
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
um

426
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,280
good

427
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,679
and next one

428
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
yeah this is the last one and this is

429
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
what we discussed in the mailing list

430
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
what happens with the ports now that we

431
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,280
have multiple transports

432
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,240
for dcv is easy we can reuse for 342.

433
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,960
one comment that we have is that

434
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
the lease constructs expired so

435
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,000
officially in the ayana page

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
for 342 is not

437
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,799
reserved anymore

438
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,679
then for quick and sap we will need to

439
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,159
request newport um just one minute or

440
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,400
not uh since we added the ayanna

441
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
considerations uh in the draft we got

442
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,960
these mail automated i guess from myanna

443
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,480
specifying a procedure to to request

444
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,000
these ports and they also say that the

445
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
closer we get to last call then it's

446
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,919
when when they will act on it

447
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
but yeah i mean i i would like to hear

448
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,440
uh based on past experience if

449
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
you think we need to do anything else

450
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
than this section

451
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
so i understand this is dino i

452
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
understand that we need a new udp port

453
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,039
for quick

454
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,480
but i thought

455
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
maybe you might know alvaro sctp uses

456
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
the same port number data points

457
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,520
as tcp and udp so we need an explicit

458
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
i don't know what an sctp port is it's

459
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
just a port

460
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,840
right

461
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,640
yeah i i i actually i went through the

462
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
ctv draft and i saw that they even have

463
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
a section specifying how how to request

464
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
the new port i mean maybe we can map it

465
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,320
to 4342 also but but as far as i

466
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
understood they have their own

467
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,480
registry

468
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
they have their own registry of course

469
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,840
well as far as i understood right there

470
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,559
yeah if we know differently

471
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,600
but i'm lazy to go there but

472
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
just to make a go

473
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
yeah maybe

474
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,840
it's just a matter to find a good

475
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
register maybe we cannot use 40c42 or

476
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
even for other protocols it's just the

477
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
lisp part let's say and then

478
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
you have different protocols that are

479
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
supported you don't need to have

480
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,080
different

481
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
numbers

482
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah yeah the only one based on what we

483
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
discussed i think for quick we need one

484
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,240
right so so so that we the map server

485
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
knows that it's it's not

486
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,559
it's a legacy review

487
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,760
yeah quick maybe more trickier yeah but

488
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,320
but yes for the http i i think forty g42

489
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,280
should work

490
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
okay if it's not taken i mean yeah yeah

491
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,840
i can check it out

492
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,559
okay and that was the last slide

493
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,400
any further comments or questions

494
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
what no thank you

495
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,120
thanks man

496
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
can we do you mind if we do the

497
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,919
distinguished name first

498
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
okay

499
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,039
you can advertise this uh

500
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
agenda

501
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
okay

502
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,320
um i just think it'll be quicker

503
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,000
we have nice chairs

504
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
okay i'm going to give an update on the

505
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,159
dash 15 version of name and coding next

506
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
slide

507
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
okay just to give you an overview of

508
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,279
what it is um we can encode um

509
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,520
what we call distinguished names or just

510
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,000
character strings that can be put in an

511
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
eid record or an arlo record of any of

512
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
the list messages

513
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,880
um

514
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
we use the afi encoding like we do for

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
afi1 and 2 for ipv4 and ipv6

516
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,120
so it's uh

517
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,600
it's just basically a 2 byte afi 17

518
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
value followed by an ascii string that's

519
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,279
null terminated it's pretty

520
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,640
straightforward

521
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,159
and it's useful to provide

522
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,600
self-documenting

523
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
the mapping database records uh you

524
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,440
could also use it to group a bunch of

525
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
things together so

526
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,559
um

527
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,440
maybe you want to associate all eids on

528
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
a train with the name of the train so

529
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
you would have you would register to the

530
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,039
mapping system a name called train 154

531
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,559
and then you would have a list of eids

532
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,840
that are currently in the train it might

533
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
have some mobility benefits there

534
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
there's a lot of other

535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
sorts of things you could do as well the

536
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
idea here is that we don't want to break

537
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
the semantics of this string with

538
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,559
power of two in addresses so

539
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
ddt and lisp decent those two mapping

540
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,360
database systems could support this

541
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
so for instance

542
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
if you did a look up on slash root slash

543
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,240
dino slash slide slash philly

544
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
it could match

545
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,720
slash fruit slash dino at the ddt route

546
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,880
which would be the delegation authority

547
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,159
for that part of the name and then the

548
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,880
children could then support slash slides

549
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
or flashlights billy so it looks like

550
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
it's more specific just like it would be

551
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,279
with a power of two um

552
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,360
address so rather than it wouldn't have

553
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
bit boundaries it could have arbitrary

554
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
boundaries just based on um so so the

555
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
design of the mapping system would have

556
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,400
to decide

557
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
if the slashes were the boundaries

558
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
because they could be variable length

559
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,760
um

560
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,799
so map

561
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,880
map requests lookups typically in the

562
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
use cases that i've implemented and that

563
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,400
are currently

564
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,039
written in specs do exact match but you

565
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
could also um

566
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
do partial matches as well

567
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,240
like if i looked up um

568
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
slash root slash dino slash

569
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,480
philly and slash philly wasn't

570
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
registered but slash shoot slash dino

571
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,159
was

572
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,240
you could get that returned and that

573
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,720
would just be a natural thing that map

574
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
sir would do with no changes

575
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
next slide

576
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,440
this is example of what i implemented in

577
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,080
my open source code is

578
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,320
this is a registration entry in the map

579
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,279
server

580
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,840
the eid prefix in

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
instance id

582
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,440
is called g xtr one this is just an xtr

583
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
that's sitting in google in a vm

584
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,600
and the arloc the rlok set um is

585
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,360
basically

586
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,799
these guys

587
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
the r loop set basically has these two

588
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
rtrs because it's going through a nat

589
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
but you could also associate a name with

590
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,399
the with an arloc record so it's encoded

591
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,320
in that our loca record this is an

592
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,480
encoding in the eid record this is the

593
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,919
encoding in the arloc record

594
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,000
these are the current um working group

595
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and individual submission

596
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
drafts that are using the distinguished

597
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,279
name stuff

598
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,399
so the ecdsa authentication

599
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,240
is using it to store

600
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,919
um the hash value when you want to look

601
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,600
public keys up in the mapping system to

602
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,440
verify signatures

603
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
we use it for grouping type stuff in

604
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
predictive rloks

605
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,559
and we use it for encoding uh

606
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
if you if you use the lcaf

607
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
geocoordinates as an eid and you want to

608
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
map it to a name like say you have the

609
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,480
geo coordinates of los angeles you may

610
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
want it to map to a name which is called

611
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
character string los angeles you could

612
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
do that sort of thing

613
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
the list policy distribution guys are

614
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
using there's a lot of policy stuff that

615
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,120
they want to use that are going to

616
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
depend on um

617
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,440
on distinguished names and in all these

618
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
cases they're describing um how the

619
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
structure of the name should be and what

620
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,039
the collision

621
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,919
opportunities or or avoidance is done in

622
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,240
those that was a comment that was done

623
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,279
on the spec overlay simple nat and the

624
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,600
list didn't cast stuff refers to this

625
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
draft

626
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,159
so we started the effort the draft was

627
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,240
built in 2016.

628
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
there was a lot of quiet period

629
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
around here in 2020 there were some

630
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
updates and we just made an update now

631
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,240
this past week to reflect make it more

632
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,720
clear how close detection is done if

633
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
there's two different use cases using

634
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,799
names and how they don't clash so we

635
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,640
added that to the spec and that was

636
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,559
joel's comment and uh we think we sat

637
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,320
aside the comment right

638
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,120
okay

639
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
next

640
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
um so we addressed the collision

641
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,080
commentary um that joel had in slash 15.

642
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,159
and i requested

643
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,080
this past weekend to request this as a

644
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,159
working group document i sent that

645
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
request to lisbeth ietf.org

646
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,399
and

647
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,440
it's really it's a very small two-page

648
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
specs so it doesn't take very much to

649
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,480
read through it so i wanted to try to

650
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
request working group last call now but

651
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,399
um

652
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,720
it's up to you guys you really should

653
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,840
request adoption go through

654
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,640
adoption and then turn around and

655
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,840
request you don't even have to repost it

656
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,679
we can mark it as adopted using the

657
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,080
exact same draft and then we can turn

658
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
around and last call

659
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
and in last call that's when we switch

660
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
it to a ietf list

661
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,720
in the proper process and then we'll do

662
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
the last call so that

663
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
two weeks all of that before london okay

664
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
sounds good uh hi alberta wrote anything

665
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,840
i'm happy with the process

666
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,679
please rename it before

667
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
sending it to the aud

668
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,520
we've had people complain about the

669
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
names before and so just to avoid

670
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
complaints okay we'll make sure it gets

671
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,240
interesting

672
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
so you wait two weeks and to see if it's

673
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
going to should be there

674
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,039
you send a note

675
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,559
we will issue the adoption call next

676
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,799
week okay we give everybody the amount

677
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,640
of time it'll be two weeks actually we

678
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
may make it three weeks because it's

679
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
august

680
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
we'll then say it's adopted please

681
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,919
repost with the right name

682
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,159
you'll repost okay you'll then send an

683
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,399
email saying can we last call this

684
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,279
okay

685
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,039
we'll last call it

686
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,039
two weeks

687
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,120
if there's a problem we'll fix it and if

688
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
not

689
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
we'll hand it to alvaro and we'll pick

690
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,840
somebody in the working group to

691
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,679
shepherd it

692
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,080
maybe he asked for a review joel did it

693
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,159
already but

694
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,399
addition in the mean in the meantime i

695
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,480
mean when it is adopted

696
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,399
we can also ask for

697
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,480
early review from the

698
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,799
security area and all the radios

699
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,159
transport area etc etc so that we

700
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,279
we

701
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,399
speed up the process a little bit yeah

702
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,320
asking for early reviews doesn't speed

703
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
up the process

704
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,679
well you have to have it at some point

705
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,720
so yeah

706
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,039
and also

707
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,320
and they will also ask what our

708
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
intention of the spec is is it full

709
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
standard proposed standard experimental

710
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,399
all day and i don't know if we're ready

711
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,919
because those other drafts depend on you

712
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,519
only go ps

713
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,679
yeah okay it can only go yes okay okay

714
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,519
but there's no point in learning about

715
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
early reviews there's just not going to

716
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
be enough weeks in here to waste any

717
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,000
other energy okay we'll just make it go

718
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,960
through the process expeditiously

719
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
got it

720
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,440
yeah sharon is on the queue

721
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,919
but wait there was on

722
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,960
um shadow want to ask something

723
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
yeah yeah um so you know i think this is

724
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,559
of course a great idea and a way

725
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,360
for people to understand how to solve uh

726
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,200
problems using a routed namespace which

727
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,320
lisp is uniquely qualified to do

728
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,200
but it's hard to explain

729
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,440
that use of lisp without being able to

730
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,840
discuss use cases as part of the charter

731
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,640
so uh

732
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
at least select uh

733
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
use cases uh

734
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
uh

735
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
possibility to discuss should be added

736
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,559
to the charter for us to

737
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,440
really show the power of these

738
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,320
router name space

739
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,640
sorry go back to the slide with the

740
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,240
yellow stuff on it

741
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,640
one more

742
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
so all these drafts that depend on

743
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,480
distinguished names are in the charter

744
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,840
to solve problems that are in the

745
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,519
charter does anybody disagree with that

746
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,080
i mean well

747
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,919
i mean some of the individual

748
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,880
submissions like lis simplenet is just

749
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,120
informational type rfc of

750
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
talking about my implementation of matt

751
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,600
and uber laze is still in design so i

752
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
don't i don't know if those are in the

753
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
charter but

754
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,159
i think you you're missing vpns also

755
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,960
right in this way

756
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,760
because i looked at that giraffe and i

757
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,799
didn't see any reference to

758
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,080
distinguished names so that's the

759
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,880
question

760
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,399
so if it does use it we need to put a

761
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,279
reference in there okay but that okay

762
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
well case in point you made a great

763
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,960
point because vpn's a very important

764
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,199
draft because it's instant id which

765
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,239
everything uses yeah

766
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
is that okay sharon did we answer your

767
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,839
question or concern

768
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
is that we should add use cases to the

769
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,720
charter

770
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
yeah that's another question

771
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,639
yeah that's a different question in the

772
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,879
sense that to change the chart that we

773
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,239
have to recharge

774
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,320
which is not uh uh how to say

775
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,239
i mean the the charter rank now has a

776
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,560
a strong focus basically on the beast

777
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,440
documents so that to work on the

778
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,239
proposed standard version of lisp

779
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,960
which we almost done

780
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
once

781
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,880
we are really done with that

782
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,440
we can even open the discussion for our

783
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,280
chartering to refocus the work of the

784
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,960
of the working group

785
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920
i guess so this is something that we we

786
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
can discuss but not today let's say

787
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,720
i don't know

788
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,599
i'm not going to suggest this question

789
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,000
today but what i'm going to say is that

790
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
um if everything goes to plan

791
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
we should within a month

792
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,280
publish the the revised specs right

793
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,400
so

794
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
within a month

795
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,560
if there's a charter

796
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
you know we can start the process right

797
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
the formal process of approving the

798
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,839
charter and the iesg and you know all

799
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,280
that stuff

800
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
disturb the process you said

801
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,079
start start yes so in other words you

802
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,160
don't have to decide on a charter today

803
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
but you know you don't have to wait till

804
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
london or anything like that we can

805
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,280
probably recharter between now and

806
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,839
london yeah right so i mean there's you

807
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,839
know time for you guys to discuss it

808
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,800
okay

809
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
any other question or comment on this

810
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
one

811
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
yeah i have two questions actually i'm

812
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,599
just reading the draft right now

813
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,640
you're not specifying how to use this

814
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
uh so what we recommended is that each

815
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
of the use case documents that you say

816
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
that you see here on the screen is

817
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,280
saying how to use it okay so that i'm

818
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
going to find that here somewhere okay

819
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
and the other thing is uh this uses

820
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
ascii

821
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,920
not utf-8 or something like that for

822
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
nationalization stuff

823
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,000
i made a reference in there of the

824
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
actual encoding um yeah it says ascii

825
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,320
it's

826
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
is the references say ascii

827
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,279
yep oh okay

828
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,560
we discussed it yeah

829
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,920
okay i mean that's the question that's

830
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,960
definitely going to come up at some

831
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,839
point why not use internet because the

832
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,760
internationalization part of it why not

833
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,040
is that what you mean right right

834
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,599
exactly okay

835
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
i mean

836
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
i don't have

837
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,839
i don't have an opinion either way and

838
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,400
we could add it at this point but

839
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
do you guys that depend on the use cases

840
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
care

841
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
because we have to we can maybe you want

842
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
to put names in kanji or something like

843
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,480
that right now yeah for now no yes yes

844
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
we've been asking has been enough but

845
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,520
but yeah also okay i'll be there either

846
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
way yeah

847
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
so i'll make that update

848
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
utf-8 is what you're

849
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
right and you know so in other places

850
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,760
like bgp that we've been putting strings

851
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
they've been in utf-8 and we actually

852
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,320
ran into a problem with one

853
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,760
community thing

854
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
where the space wasn't enough

855
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
because for example in cyrillic

856
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,079
you need a lot more characters or

857
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,680
something i'm sorry no there's a it

858
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,760
turns out there's a

859
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,680
big problem we can't just go to utf-8

860
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
okay

861
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,359
if we want to go to utf-8 we would have

862
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,640
to redo the in the structure completely

863
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
because you rely on zero termination

864
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,079
zero termination does not work for utf-8

865
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,640
so it's either we leave it the way it is

866
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,599
or we redo it completely you can't just

867
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,839
go to your

868
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,680
sounds like to me we should keep it the

869
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
way it is and if we need other types of

870
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,440
character stats we build a lcaf

871
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
and then it's a more flexible what do

872
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,359
you think just just be ready for the

873
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,880
question right because someone else is

874
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
going to ask that no

875
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,079
and will they get raised will they

876
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,760
accept our answer that we want to keep

877
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
it an ascii

878
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,040
can we put it

879
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,520
can we put it explicitly on the drafters

880
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,800
a statement that says for the use cases

881
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
or

882
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,839
asking coding

883
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,839
looks sufficient does it make sense or

884
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,440
not

885
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,040
i don't know it says it says what it

886
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,000
says right um but the question will come

887
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
up and whoever is shepherding it will

888
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,200
have to be prepared to deal with it

889
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
okay

890
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,520
sounds like you

891
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
don't even i mean

892
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,960
no we'll probably get somebody else to

893
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,200
do it we should be getting other people

894
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,359
okay whatever

895
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,599
luigi shepherded all those hard ones

896
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,480
yeah he needs a break

897
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,279
some location

898
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,040
um

899
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,839
any more questions or comments on this

900
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,079
one okay let's move to the next

901
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,640
satellite

902
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,160
okay so this draft um

903
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
is a first stab at looking at using the

904
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
satellite networks um as an underlay and

905
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
running lisp as an overlay on top of

906
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
that so it's kind of got to stand on

907
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
your head a little bit but i'll show you

908
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
in a diagram in a second

909
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,119
so the high level goals for this draft

910
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,560
is uh

911
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
we know that a lisp overlay can run over

912
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
any ip packet delivery underlay be it

913
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,560
ipv4 ipv6 and if the satellite network

914
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,880
can deliver ip packets which

915
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,480
existing

916
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,160
the the satellite networks i know that

917
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,400
are in operation today can do that uh we

918
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,119
can have lisp run as an overlay on top

919
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,680
of that satellite network um but

920
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,280
actually without touching anything in

921
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
the satellite network

922
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
and this would be just another example

923
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
of how we can run lisp

924
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
over like we do the capital i internet

925
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,680
where the rloks are on the ground or

926
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,960
3gpp network where we run lisp on the

927
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,920
enode b's or in the ico network the

928
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
aeronautical network where we run lisp

929
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,720
on the ground stations we would just run

930
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,319
lisp on the ground station here that

931
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,359
have satellite links up

932
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,160
um

933
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,000
this is not necessarily how it works but

934
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
kind of what are the benefits but

935
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,880
as always any lisp underlay or any

936
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,839
underlay network doesn't store eid state

937
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,960
so that would be the same with the

938
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
satellite network

939
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
the satellite network is unaware that

940
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,079
lisp is running over it it's just just

941
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,680
like it's kind of unaware of any other

942
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,839
applications that run over it too so

943
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
it's not it's actually ignoring the

944
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,000
satellite network and just using it as

945
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,119
uh as an ip delivery system

946
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,359
the overlay requires the underlay to

947
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,839
deliver packets to our local addresses

948
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
and the underlay uh can that the

949
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,160
underlay can route to so the assumption

950
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,280
is is when

951
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,440
um an itr pre-pens a packet and uses the

952
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,119
outer destination address we assume that

953
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,800
the underlay could um

954
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,079
forward that pack and that's what we

955
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,560
call a routing locator or outlook

956
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
the underlay number can transport ipv4

957
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
ipv6 packets and can be dual stack just

958
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,200
like it can on the terrestrial network

959
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,480
okay

960
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,640
and when path optimization is available

961
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,200
in the underlay just like on the capital

962
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,720
internet now if you're running segment

963
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
routing and you want the xtr to

964
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
influence the path of the underlay it

965
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
could prepend source routes or segment

966
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
routes in the packet this would be the

967
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,119
same in the satellite network as well if

968
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
we wanted to use any kind of source

969
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,119
routing be it relative to the satellite

970
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,040
network or using itf mechanisms

971
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,839
next

972
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
so here's a pictorial uh we see those

973
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,200
satellites up in space we call that the

974
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,680
underlay and we see those links between

975
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,119
satellites called

976
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,599
isls inner satellite links those are

977
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,760
typically one or more laser links that

978
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160
go between um the satellites in low

979
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,880
earth orbit in leo

980
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,800
and it turns out that this is

981
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,920
what um

982
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,240
amazon is about to to deploy as well as

983
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,119
spacex doing with starlink okay so what

984
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,119
we do is that these what we have on the

985
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
ground are the overlaid nodes and the

986
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,160
mapping system okay so lisp an xtr will

987
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
run on the ground station that has a

988
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,839
satellite link that goes up

989
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,480
today most communications that happen is

990
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
you go up in one satellite and then down

991
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,319
if you go

992
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,000
if you can go like the quarter of the

993
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,319
earth you can do it with one satellite

994
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,560
um because of where the uh

995
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,280
the satellites are positioned in leo in

996
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,040
geosynchronous that was always the way

997
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
because it was much higher up added

998
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
delay but it can capture more of the

999
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,720
earth's surface here it may not do that

1000
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,880
so if you want to go from say like san

1001
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,359
francisco to london you might have to go

1002
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,280
up a satellite

1003
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
an isl to another satellite and then

1004
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,680
down okay but the idea is is that list

1005
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,040
doesn't care about this whatever this

1006
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,599
satellite has to do to deliver a packet

1007
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,680
from this outlook

1008
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,839
it just does

1009
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,000
that okay

1010
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
next slide

1011
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,359
so these are the sort of features sorry

1012
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,040
for the busyness of the slide but we'll

1013
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,640
go through one each

1014
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,680
the eids can roam around ground station

1015
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,960
xtrs

1016
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
just like the mobility draft the id

1017
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,480
mobility draft says it's no different

1018
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,200
than

1019
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,079
if the eids are roaming in a vm

1020
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
on a top of rack switch it's the same

1021
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,200
sort of machinery that's used so eid

1022
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,280
mobility and even predictive our looks

1023
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
can be used even in this scenario

1024
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,359
because uh it's these are list features

1025
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,720
and we don't care what we don't depend

1026
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,119
on the underlay to do anything here

1027
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,599
also the ground station xdrs can load

1028
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,079
speed traffic across different our locks

1029
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,319
on the satellite network or across our

1030
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
locals where on our load could be up in

1031
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,920
space and one can be terrestrial on the

1032
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,240
ground as well

1033
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,000
and of course all the packets can be

1034
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,079
less crypto as well so if they go up to

1035
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,280
space and you don't want anybody to

1036
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,960
snoop on them even though the russians

1037
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,119
are leaving the space stand center now

1038
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,040
um you could um

1039
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,200
you could encrypt the packets

1040
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,280
and of course the gs xdrs can use

1041
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,359
alternate paths when maybe the satellite

1042
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,440
network is not totally connected and i

1043
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
give two examples here

1044
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,960
normally you would go

1045
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,599
on an xtr you would go up to a satellite

1046
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,680
and then maybe go across an isl to

1047
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,119
another satellite and then down to

1048
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,640
another xtr

1049
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
maybe

1050
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
the isls are because the satellites are

1051
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,680
always moving the lasers are going up

1052
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,119
and down all the time you may not have

1053
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,119
that connectivity but of course we can

1054
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,119
use list traffic engineering and

1055
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,839
actually encapsulate to an rti so we

1056
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,720
would go up from this xtr to a satellite

1057
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,640
and then back down to an rtr that would

1058
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,839
take off the outer header and

1059
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,920
re-encapsulate it to that outlet and

1060
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
then go up to satellite and down so

1061
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,880
those those sort of traffic engineering

1062
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,400
features are available by just using

1063
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,760
regular lisp

1064
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,079
okay

1065
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,040
and we could use the telemetry stuff

1066
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,359
that we proposed in that draft this

1067
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,359
draft here to actually test the

1068
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,040
satellite network so we know which paths

1069
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,520
are good and we can we could actually if

1070
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,359
if the satellite network each satellite

1071
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,960
is an ip hop we could actually trace

1072
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,680
route we can measure one-way latency

1073
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,599
both forward and reverse hop counts all

1074
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,200
that kind of stuff just like we do the

1075
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,240
under the uh terrestrial underlay

1076
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,599
boy it's hard to breathe and percent

1077
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,839
present at the same time

1078
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,160
i haven't done this yet um

1079
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,880
ground stations xtrx can offer eid

1080
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,480
multicast service by doing head-end

1081
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,960
replication using any underlay multicast

1082
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
service so if the satellite network's

1083
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,200
going to provide a multicast service we

1084
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
can use it otherwise you can just

1085
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,800
unicast replicate over it we know that

1086
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,240
works as well

1087
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
uh i'm not it's not clear to me and it

1088
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,000
hasn't been specced out if there's a

1089
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,599
multicast service that's going to be

1090
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,520
supported in the in the satellite

1091
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,960
networks that are being deployed today

1092
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,359
or are planning to be deployed that

1093
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,119
should be interesting work like i said

1094
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,119
this is kind of a first stab we're

1095
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,560
learning more about what the underlay

1096
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,400
could do and are there advantages to

1097
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,000
make the overlay work better if we can

1098
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,800
make

1099
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,480
um take advantage of the underlay it's

1100
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,520
kind of

1101
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,160
a two-sided sword where you sometimes

1102
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,520
want to always ignore the underlay

1103
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,119
because you just want it to deliver

1104
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,560
simple packets

1105
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,160
and then you just want all the features

1106
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,440
to be on the edge in the overlay

1107
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,839
and of course if you have a mix of lisp

1108
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,680
and non-list sites all the interworking

1109
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,720
features

1110
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,200
so if you have um

1111
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
somebody an eid that's sitting behind a

1112
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,280
ground station xtr that wants to talk to

1113
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,680
google.com that's not a lisp site all

1114
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,319
the machinery the list the list and that

1115
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,760
stuff and the um

1116
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,599
pxtr machinery can work as well

1117
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,760
um the only thing we didn't um talk

1118
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,440
about is do you want to put any list

1119
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
nodes in on the satellite nodes and make

1120
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,079
them routers not sure yet so if anybody

1121
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,079
has any thoughts of on that and if it's

1122
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,559
useful um

1123
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,359
we could determine that i don't know if

1124
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,800
if there's any advantage other than

1125
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,599
maybe latency to do a decap up there

1126
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,480
rather than down here you know so

1127
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,720
next

1128
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,130
um so

1129
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,280
[Music]

1130
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,640
i was just question should we make a

1131
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
working group document i don't i don't i

1132
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,720
don't have any preference i mean we

1133
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
could work on it as an individual

1134
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,400
submission i think the work we have left

1135
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,520
to do is to look closer at the satellite

1136
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
networks and see what's going on

1137
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,480
and

1138
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,319
maybe try to do some prototyping i think

1139
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,559
my open source implementation could work

1140
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,599
as is i just need a box with a satellite

1141
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,240
link so i'm gonna i my plans are is to

1142
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,720
call up spacex and say can i put some

1143
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
open source code on on your uh ground

1144
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,800
station and let's see what they what

1145
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,160
they would do what they would say i

1146
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,559
don't know but i'm going to try

1147
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,400
but you know even actually even if it's

1148
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,319
one hop away from a starling box it

1149
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,480
might serve the same purpose because the

1150
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,920
server could you know what i mean so we

1151
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
could we can still test it though the

1152
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,520
whole point is if we encapsulate a

1153
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,480
packet

1154
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,040
and the the starlink router is not doing

1155
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
less but at least it knows how to route

1156
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,400
the packet to the r look and it will go

1157
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,720
up right so

1158
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,559
now when it comes down the way their

1159
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,079
service works now when it comes down it

1160
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,559
always comes to a google data center so

1161
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,559
um you're not you're you'll have to

1162
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,880
deliver it to a non-eid or something

1163
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,400
like that but we'll you know if we could

1164
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,280
put an xtr in a vm in a google cloud or

1165
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,599
whatever and test it that way so i'm

1166
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,680
planning on doing some experience with

1167
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,480
that

1168
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,280
you guys are welcome

1169
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,520
i think that's it is that right

1170
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
yeah

1171
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,359
it looks like a question

1172
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,599
question and comments

1173
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,800
um

1174
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,720
have you given any consideration to

1175
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,040
mobility in the draft i haven't read it

1176
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,480
sorry but uh

1177
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,400
um so the

1178
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,240
the devices that are on the ground that

1179
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,160
are moving from ground station to ground

1180
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,319
station they'll use eid mobility

1181
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,480
according to the draft we did itself so

1182
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,040
what what moves is not the xtr

1183
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,480
it's it's the

1184
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,559
oh the xtr movie well this is an

1185
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,920
interesting new property that we've

1186
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,079
never seen before because

1187
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,000
even though the xtr is stationary

1188
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,359
normally

1189
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,839
normally when a lisp when eids move they

1190
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,599
get new r logs because they're landing

1191
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,079
somewhere new right but it turns out

1192
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,240
what's happening is now

1193
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,680
the

1194
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,240
xtr is actually stationary right but the

1195
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,839
satellites are moving in and out and the

1196
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,440
question is will the satellite network

1197
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,160
re

1198
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,400
um reassign the rlope to that ground

1199
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,640
station but if it does it's just like

1200
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,480
the eid moves so it is kind of like a

1201
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,400
mobility event but all our machinery

1202
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,720
will work with in that case as well

1203
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,680
so interesting kind of cool okay we'll

1204
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
see we'll see if it introduces new

1205
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,520
problems

1206
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,960
but i i've done this testing before

1207
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,119
where i would run lisp at my house and i

1208
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,880
would disconnect my cable link all the

1209
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
time and every time i disconnect well i

1210
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
think it was uh it was a few years ago

1211
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,960
with att dsl every time i disconnect and

1212
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,079
reconnected

1213
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,160
18t would give me another address so i

1214
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,680
was testing my air loads changing all

1215
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,200
the time and i was trying to do that

1216
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,240
fast and it's the same way

1217
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,400
so this is not a new problem from our or

1218
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
the overlays point of view

1219
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,839
okay

1220
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,240
genji

1221
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,800
uh kinji china mobile

1222
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,680
um

1223
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,200
you know i'll have an arrest through

1224
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,760
your uh your draft but from your

1225
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,559
description and talk today

1226
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,040
i and also you said okay so far there

1227
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
are only one as a link but mate is a

1228
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,920
link since you did not mention anything

1229
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,680
about the dynamics about how the

1230
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,760
rotation orbital movement no type of

1231
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,280
things

1232
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,720
so i don't know why is the satellite

1233
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,800
related i think because i can give you

1234
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,680
analogy you can put your r lock

1235
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
on your car and you keep driving and

1236
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,599
then that's it it's not saturday at all

1237
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,559
but they still so why is satellite

1238
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,640
it makes such a big deal for the draft

1239
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
thank you

1240
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,119
oh we're just it's just another underlay

1241
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,040
that we can run over and if if we want

1242
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,960
to reach rural places

1243
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,760
um which is what starling's use case is

1244
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,720
uh

1245
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,960
we may want to run it's it's not the

1246
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,640
only way you can do things i mean if

1247
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,480
you're our loc if you're on a car if

1248
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,000
you're driving in a car and lisp is

1249
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,680
running in your car and your outlook is

1250
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,599
changing because it's on a 4g or 5g

1251
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,920
network so be it

1252
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,760
but if if that car needs to communicate

1253
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,440
with something that's in a you know up

1254
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,359
in montana northern montana or something

1255
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,640
and they don't have internet access

1256
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,160
except for starlink

1257
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,040
then

1258
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,200
you run lisp on that side and then and

1259
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,559
then they can move between ground

1260
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,000
stations in their local area you know

1261
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,079
the cars moving around in this urban

1262
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,920
area and then maybe the cell phone's

1263
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,839
moving around in this rural area you

1264
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,839
know

1265
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,440
of the technology i i still cannot see

1266
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,160
the

1267
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,000
the technical difference

1268
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,839
like yes i understand more in order to

1269
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,800
talk some people in mahana not some some

1270
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,359
place nowhere you have your satellite

1271
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,520
but still in terms of technology

1272
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,240
but to me just like in the moving car

1273
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,359
it's it's

1274
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,280
have no difference from just like a

1275
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,720
satellite movement

1276
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,680
are you saying are you questioning that

1277
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,440
running over satellites not useful is

1278
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
that no no no because tomorrow i'm going

1279
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,119
to have another i have a draft on my

1280
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,599
satellite but i really try to understand

1281
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,960
why you know uh this is satellite

1282
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,720
suppose you try to

1283
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,800
use some satellite technology that is

1284
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,040
significant for the list or for your

1285
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
draft

1286
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,030
is that the

1287
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,480
[Music]

1288
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,640
not having the restroom so in your draft

1289
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
have you talked anything about like

1290
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,119
satellite technologies that will make

1291
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,440
your draft more significant

1292
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,079
oh it's just like okay you are using

1293
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,800
some underlay network that is keep

1294
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,200
moving

1295
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,480
we we have a lisp draft called list

1296
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,920
mobile network

1297
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,440
that talks about how you support layer 3

1298
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,640
mobility inside of 3gpp network in that

1299
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,800
use case we say list can run on the

1300
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,920
enode b's so when cell phones move

1301
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,240
move from one enob to another e node b

1302
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,520
they don't have to change their ip

1303
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,440
address and their connection stay up

1304
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,520
okay so that's the case because cell

1305
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,079
phones connect to towers okay now we

1306
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,520
have these other things called ground

1307
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,720
station xtrs that have rf links up to

1308
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,119
aircraft that's what the account

1309
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,480
standard is doing

1310
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,040
and so planes are moving around and and

1311
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,280
um they're eid's up there and they're

1312
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,359
connecting to ground stations and so

1313
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,119
that's just another sub network using

1314
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,040
that wireless network so now we have

1315
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,040
satellite which is yet another one and

1316
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,319
of course we have the terrestrial

1317
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,079
internet right

1318
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,280
that's all

1319
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,559
okay does that make sense

1320
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,319
yeah yeah sure

1321
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
take care of coin oh sorry eric klein

1322
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,920
eleria um forgive me for i'm not uh a

1323
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,880
terribly well-versed lisp person uh

1324
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,359
is there a presumption that the gs xdrs

1325
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,960
have some terrestrial control plane

1326
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,559
connectivity all the time or is it

1327
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,640
possible that they may only have control

1328
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,400
plane connectivity over the

1329
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,240
orbital domain yeah good question and if

1330
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,280
so does that have implications for

1331
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,920
uh the control plane uh reliability yeah

1332
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,359
great really good question can you go

1333
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,119
back to the diagram

1334
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,599
so the mapping system the assumption

1335
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,880
we're making in the first version of the

1336
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,119
giraffe is that the mapping system is on

1337
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,960
the ground and that's the control plane

1338
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,920
that we use

1339
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,839
for this guy to find that

1340
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,839
load but it turns out that the mapping

1341
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,079
system ip addresses to access it the map

1342
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,920
servers and resolvers are all in our

1343
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,880
lock space so you arguably could put the

1344
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,960
mapping system somewhere there assuming

1345
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,400
that the satellite can route to that

1346
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,440
outlook space as well so and so you

1347
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,119
could do one or the other or you could

1348
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,040
look this mapping system could have map

1349
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,960
servers that are load split so we don't

1350
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,319
we don't know yet what's the best thing

1351
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,200
to do but i'm taking the point that

1352
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,720
you're making that if we put it up in

1353
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,960
the satellite network that there will be

1354
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,880
less reliability because they're moving

1355
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
the mapping system is moving now where

1356
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,960
here it's kind of stationary well

1357
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,640
there's also yeah even if everything's

1358
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,000
working correctly there's just higher

1359
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,880
latencies right yeah good point

1360
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,960
the tcp tcp stuff will need some kind of

1361
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,880
a pep in front of it and

1362
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
right anyway yeah i definitely agree

1363
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,839
yeah thank you

1364
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,279
all right

1365
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,160
i have one one last question i i mean if

1366
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,960
you go to this slide

1367
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,400
yeah you say

1368
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,839
uh

1369
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,480
across in the second bullet or across

1370
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,799
our locks in space

1371
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,880
if in space you have our locks it means

1372
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,359
that the satellites have to run lisp

1373
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,920
they have to be xtrs

1374
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,760
right because otherwise it's just an

1375
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,680
underlay on a way off i'll show you what

1376
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,680
i mean i understand your question so

1377
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,160
could you go to the uh

1378
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
to the uh diagram

1379
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,839
thank you okay so let's say

1380
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,720
this xtr has our load that's always

1381
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,119
reachable via the satellite this is this

1382
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,160
xtf

1383
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,359
this

1384
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,040
oh

1385
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,880
that that xtr on the right hand side

1386
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,400
could have a terrestrial link that's

1387
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
also accessible on the ground so there

1388
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,240
there'll be two r locks that you can

1389
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,480
load split your traffic over

1390
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,400
oh okay

1391
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,839
okay i see so what you're doing is your

1392
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,839
load splitting for different flows on

1393
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,839
the ground and going up and over okay

1394
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,839
okay okay well this was not clear

1395
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,599
thank you yeah i'll try to make that

1396
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,520
more clear especially in the draft yeah

1397
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
let's go mike cisco uh hey mike i was

1398
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,440
wondering if you if you gave into

1399
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
consideration that there's any mtu

1400
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,520
limitations between the gs xdr and the

1401
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,160
satellite because i know this like the

1402
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,319
us military and these guys

1403
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,440
they have

1404
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,040
crypto devices in front they're always

1405
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,280
struggling to get like gre and mpls in

1406
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,079
this whole alpha thing up there yeah i

1407
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
don't know yet that's a great that's a

1408
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,359
great question and we should look at

1409
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,559
that of course we always assume 1500 or

1410
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,319
or or 1266 for ipv6 or whatever

1411
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,040
so

1412
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,880
but yeah that's a good point and and if

1413
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,480
there are mtu issues we'll deal with

1414
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
them like we do in 6831

1415
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,319
where you know we have those three

1416
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,359
options you know

1417
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,760
okay

1418
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,079
so if there are no more questions or

1419
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,599
comments

1420
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,880
uh there is jody

1421
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,440
well

1422
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,680
just this out of curiosity

1423
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,880
um well you know the isl iesl links they

1424
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,400
usually change between the satellites as

1425
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,319
far as i know do you think it would make

1426
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,880
sense converting satellite into a mobile

1427
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,760
node at least mobile node

1428
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,920
from a list perspective yeah

1429
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,480
like give it an eid and let it uh let's

1430
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,640
see yeah so they can so i mean the

1431
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
mobility use case now since you have a

1432
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,119
lot of links that are changing

1433
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,839
continuously the satellites

1434
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,240
so i think what you're saying is a

1435
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,640
satellite could be a linux system that's

1436
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,240
part of the overlay and we assign it an

1437
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,240
eid because we want to talk to it on the

1438
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,760
overlay

1439
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,079
that i mean

1440
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,799
the

1441
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,319
point of attachment is always changing

1442
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,240
so they have our locks yeah right so i

1443
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,558
don't know

1444
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,720
you want to track where what are lokes

1445
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
well it's not i mean these satellites

1446
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,920
can move around and they're probably not

1447
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,720
going to be ip re-ip addressed so their

1448
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,920
looks are going to stay the same but

1449
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,720
you're not going to be able to reach

1450
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,599
them because they're on the other side

1451
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,839
of the earth okay yeah so yeah okay so

1452
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,280
it's not the different ipads it's

1453
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,480
different the

1454
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,200
place it's unreachable right okay okay

1455
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
thanks and then 40 minutes later it's

1456
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,160
going to come around and you're going to

1457
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,240
see it again right but of course this

1458
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,160
guy doesn't know because he's homing to

1459
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,160
a satellite and that satellites come in

1460
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,480
and out he just has connectivity he

1461
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,240
doesn't even really care what he is

1462
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,760
remember the r look that he's sending a

1463
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,920
packet to is on the ground and the and

1464
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
the satellite is just a transit network

1465
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,559
yeah it was like a different use case

1466
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,440
yeah

1467
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,839
but i mean i haven't considered what if

1468
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,079
you want a satellite system to be an eid

1469
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:34,960
node

1470
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,440
that's part of the overlay and

1471
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,839
and because it will go out of phase do

1472
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,200
you want to be able to reach it on the

1473
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,520
overlay it's a little more complex use

1474
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,400
case

1475
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
and we'd have to see a really strong

1476
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
requirement why we would need that

1477
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,720
but right now i just want to use the

1478
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,040
satellite as it exists and see how well

1479
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,280
it delivers ip packets right this is

1480
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,799
something we can discuss more on the

1481
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,839
mailing list we are uh time is up

1482
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:00,960
basically

1483
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,799
can see if you can also send your

1484
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,960
comment on the mailing list so that

1485
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
can be discussed more than clarified

1486
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,720
that would be helpful

1487
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,400
other than that welcome

1488
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,559
welcome thank you for being here thank

1489
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,280
you dino and see you again in london

1490
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,119
[Music]

1491
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,359
thank you

1492
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,160
oh wow utf-8 it doesn't work

1493
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,040
no

1494
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,480
no

1495
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,720
but um
