okay let's see if it works

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
welcome to operational security

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,080
capabilities

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
uh ron is joining us remote

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,880
i'm as you can see is on side

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
so this is not well i guess you've seen

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
it many times

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
this week but

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,640
look at this again

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,480
um

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,600
housekeeping uh

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
please use on-site tool if you

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,960
want to join the queue because it does

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,079
help

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
us chairs to

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
control the queue if everyone will be

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
using the tool doesn't matter if you are

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,479
on site or remote

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
if you join in from laptop

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
keep your audio and video off

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,960
and don't forget to leave the queue when

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
done

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
uh

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
what

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah and speakers for

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,759
those who are inside i'll control the

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
slides

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
uh

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,479
we need meeting minutes take care

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
any volunteers

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
thank you very much really appreciate it

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,759
uh

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
okay so we have three presentations

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
today

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,799
first is working group item indicators

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,640
of compromise

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
and we have

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
two drafts

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
which are individual ones

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,280
since we met last time about a year ago

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
we we finally published operational

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,479
security considerations for ipv6 but it

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,719
was 10 years

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,200
12 okay is it a record i don't know

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,640
close okay close so and it got nice

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
number

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
9099

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
and we have another

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
old draft in the

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
rfc editors queue about the filtering of

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
ipv6 packet with extension headers

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
hopefully it will be published soon as

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
well

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
so

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
the first presentation today

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
should be

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,200
indication of compromised okay so

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,360
stop slideshare share preloaded slides

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,239
and

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,680
okay let me share your presentation

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
okay thank you

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
thank you

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,680
um hi everyone um so i'm here to present

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
uh draft on its case of compromise

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
they're on attack defense it's on behalf

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
of myself and the other authors uh

70
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,959
kirsty olly and james

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
uh so next slide please

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
um so yeah just to quickly run through

73
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,239
the history of how we got here

74
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
so this originally came to set dispatch

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
at itf 107

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
um brought it to whatsec following that

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
following the recommended dispatch made

78
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
some updates

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
um since we presented it uh ollie

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
presented it itf111 online

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
um it was adopted by the working group

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
earlier this year

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
um and then the slide says no further

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,599
reviews or comments but actually

85
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
kathleen moriarty kindly

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,959
put a review on the list a couple of

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
days ago so there has been a further

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,080
review but i don't think there was

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
anything in there that

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
significantly changed the document with

91
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
some helpful points

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,040
um and yeah i published the latest

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
version earlier this month which is i

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,120
think the sixth version in total

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,319
so it's had a fair few rounds of

96
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
feedback and review and change now

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
next slide please

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
um so yeah as a quick reminder of what

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
the motivation was for the document

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,159
so

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,799
i just wanted to document what is uh an

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,320
operational security technique that's

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
sort of out in the wild and widely used

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
and sort of just record the best

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,279
practice so i don't think that's

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,000
actually documented anywhere really

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
um

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
we also wanted to try and share it with

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
the itf i think it's not a topic that

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
necessarily got broad familiarity across

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
the whole of the itf so we thought it'd

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
be a useful thing to do

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
um we also wanted to just try and

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
address that it's sometimes overlooked

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
in protocol design

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
um so a lot of protocols will make

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
decisions that like basically make these

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
iocs which i'll

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
cover the definition again later um just

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
make them harder to use so we just

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
wanted to make people aware so if a

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,639
protocol is coming out that's going to

123
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,479
make them harder to use that people know

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,840
they're doing that and know what the

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
trade-off is there

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
and lastly i just wanted to bring some

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
cyber defense expertise into the itf so

128
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
we all the authors uh work in cyber

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
security so want to try and bring max i

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,199
think there's not

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
too many cyber security professionals

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
across the itf um

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
uh possibly the exception of this room

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,160
but it wants to sort of bring that in

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
and thought this would be a good way to

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
do it

137
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,560
uh next slide please

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
um yeah this is the abstract i'm not

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
going to read it um you can all read it

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,919
separately read the draft if you haven't

141
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
already um

142
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,919
but sort of roughly just cover what

143
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,000
indicator compromise are

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
um some ways you can use them some ways

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
they have been used and roughly what

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
their benefits are and what their

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,479
limitations are

148
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,600
um

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
and as i said some best practice

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
uh next slide please

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
um

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,199
yep so just just to recover what iocs

153
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
are for those haven't read the draft

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
so they're basically artifacts that you

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,319
can

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
use to sort of identify an attacker

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
who's attacking your network your your

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
computer um so these include things like

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
their tactics like how they act and the

160
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,160
techniques they use

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
uh the tools they might use um or just

162
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
like uh sort of ip addresses that they

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,039
come from um and domain names associated

164
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
with the attack um so some more examples

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
there including sort of hashes of

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
malicious executables that they're using

167
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
um and yeah more more of the tools um as

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
we cover in the draft like the range of

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
iocs that exist have different sort of

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
benefits and

171
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
difficulties so

172
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
sort of dying like finding a domain name

173
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
associated with an attack is quite easy

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
but it's also relatively easy for an

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
attacker to change

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
um if you start blocking it but if you

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
put the effort in to diagnose exactly

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
how they run their attacks and what

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,759
tools they're using that's much more

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
fundamental to their

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
mo so

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
much harder than to change

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
um but iocs run that whole gamut

184
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
uh next slide please

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,199
um yep so a quick outline of the draft

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,639
so we cover

187
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,280
uh what the fundamentals of iocs are so

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,479
what they are so i just mentioned the

189
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
pyramid of pain which is that that's a

190
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,039
sort of scale i just discussed and the

191
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
life cycle like how you use it all the

192
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
way through from finding an ioc like

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,319
noticing it in a live attack all the way

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,520
through to

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
deploying it out to the wider community

196
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
so everyone can defend themselves and

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
through to like retiring it when it's no

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
longer useful

199
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
as attackers move on

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
uh we cover how to use them effectively

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
what some of the benefits are of using

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
them and a couple of case studies where

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
in order to prevent sort of widespread

204
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
attacks iocs have been sort of collected

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
and shared and

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
been put to good use to prevent attack

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
spreading

208
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
and then some of the limitations

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,639
like they're a relatively lightweight

210
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
way of defending your network so that

211
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,919
comes with some trade-offs um and yeah

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,199
thinking about the different types of

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
precision you get with different iocs

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
and the time and effort it takes to

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
diagnose and use a given ioc

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,800
um and then lastly a brief bit on best

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
practice including sort of how you

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
should share them amongst defenders

219
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
uh next slide please

220
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
um yeah so this is a very quick

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
presentation just sort of remind

222
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,120
everyone about the document um so we'd

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
love further reviews and comments i said

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,039
you know had one from kathleen uh which

225
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
will will look to work into a future

226
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
version but any more comments and

227
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,360
reviews really welcomed and i suppose

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
given we haven't had any major like

229
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
comments or problems coming up on the

230
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
mailing list or from any other quarter

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
for a while we want to know like do we

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
think this is ready for working group

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
last call

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
um so we think it's pretty stable we

235
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
think it's in quite good shape

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
uh so yeah that that's it uh quite quick

237
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
presentation any questions

238
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
um

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
so i don't

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
see anyone on the queue but i'd like to

241
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
ask people to tell who actually read the

242
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
draft

243
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,279
okay

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
oh sorry uh

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
uh

246
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
i'm trying to do something with that

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,399
quite i think

248
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
click on the wrong one

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,279
um

250
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,080
so

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
i would like

252
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
to

253
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
get a volunteers to review it during the

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
last call

255
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,920
any

256
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
volunteers to do this

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
okay we can ask on the list but

258
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
i really really really think we need to

259
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
get some like review during the last

260
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,399
call and not just take a silence as a

261
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
indicator of yeah the draft

262
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
the indicator of the draft should be

263
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
progressed but yeah i will start the

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
last call

265
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,079
on the list

266
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,120

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
read it please do seek me out i'm very

277
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600

should be

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
a source address validation eager or who

283
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
is presenting

284
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399

okay i'll preload the slides just on

302
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
time

303
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360

yeah okay good so tell me okay we'll do

307
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
voice control over the slides yes

308
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
awesome

309
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
all right um so i'm igor lubachev and

310
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,839
i'm gonna talk to you a little bit about

311
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,200
our um

312
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,519
take on source address validation

313
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,440
and especially this is the work we're

314
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
bringing here because

315
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
it's based it's basing on updating the

316
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
uh the the work that's actually been

317
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
published two years ago by this group

318
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
next

319
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
right

320
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,959
this problem should be quite familiar to

321
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
everybody at atf

322
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
we've been trying to solve it for

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,240
at least 22 years

324
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
so

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
how do we stop

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,440
address proofing unauthorized packets go

327
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,720
being sent into the network

328
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
since 2004 effectively the only

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
technique

330
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,519
that's been used is

331
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
look at the bgp update messages

332
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
try to infer

333
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
look at your fib or rib

334
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
and try to insert something

335
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,760
that information what's

336
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,959
been

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
what's valid um

338
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
feasible path is was the best thing

339
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
which was not saying too much because it

340
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
was proven quite useless in practice it

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
assumed absolutely no uh

342
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,560
route filtering so effectively very

343
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
little uh traffic engineering well

344
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
that's not real world

345
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
so that's um

346
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
in

347
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
2020 uh 8704 was published which was

348
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
effectively an update on feasible path

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,959
which said

350
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
let's look at those bgp update messages

351
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
a little bit closer and make a little

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,680
bit more inferences and look at the

353
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
origin as number

354
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,480
and

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,959
therefore allow paths not just what

356
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
you've seen on this interface in reverse

357
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,040
but also the paths that are advertised

358
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,519
by the same origin as

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,880
um than

360
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
any of the paths that you've seen in

361
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,880
this interface which is better

362
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,079
um

363
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
still has a number of issues uh we'll

364
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,839
see

365
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
them we'll look at them later so but

366
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,920
it's better

367
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
it also has a little

368
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
small paragraph saying that oh by the

369
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,880
way you can also look at raw information

370
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
uh but it's kind of an afterthought it

371
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
doesn't have any details but

372
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
it's an interesting idea

373
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
and uh

374
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,720
this atf we have actually a working

375
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
group i mean this problem is still not

376
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,519
solved uh seventh uh

377
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,120
so more people look into it next

378
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,279
okay good

379
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,240
um

380
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
very simple example to show where 8704

381
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
still doesn't work i mean you have an

382
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
as1 which has a

383
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,880
provider s2 s2 is multi-homed

384
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
it sends both

385
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,360
both ways its customer routes but for

386
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
whatever reasons reasons

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,120
it only wants to send its own path to a3

388
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
and now looking at

389
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,399
if as4 is trying to do some sort of

390
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
address validation using 8704

391
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,519
it will only see path announced um

392
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,560
prefixes that's where s1 is the original

393
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
asset will not see a s2 it's an origin

394
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
as it will not consider

395
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
its routes um

396
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
even though it learns that

397
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,360
there is a route from from the pier

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,399
okay so 22 years in why is this problem

399
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,480
still so hard when so many people are

400
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,560
working

401
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
my take is that it's basically because

402
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
we're trying to infer

403
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
some information about data plane

404
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
forwarding from a signal that was never

405
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
designed for it which is reachability

406
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
bjp

407
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,079
so that signal just doesn't have enough

408
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,279
information um to do the right to for

409
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
the solution

410
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,279
so and one of those

411
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
ideas is that well not one of the ideas

412
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
says hey

413
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
we have another sort of information that

414
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,880
was also not designed for it

415
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,120
but uh things like uh raw and aspar and

416
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
actually it was recently suggested maybe

417
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
also

418
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,279
signed iar data

419
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
how about will also mine

420
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
that

421
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
for source of use useful information

422
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,959
next

423
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,480
um and just quickly one more example uh

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
that's important that we need to solve i

425
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
mean this problem is

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
kind of

427
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,720
familiar

428
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
to me because it's about some product

429
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
that i was involved in i immediately

430
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,720
apologized for this slide it took us

431
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
from internal presentation it has a lot

432
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
more graphics than they usually used to

433
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
at atf

434
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,240
but um

435
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
effectively it's a

436
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,720
cdn implementation where you have

437
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
any cast ap that cdn wants to serve

438
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,640
content on the anycast home pop i would

439
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
call it that way

440
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,359
receive the request uh decides

441
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
that actually you want to send a service

442
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
from another pub that's for whatever

443
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,679
reason that's where content is it's

444
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,520
closer to the user

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,160
uh tunnels all the packets on that

446
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
connection

447
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
to the edge and the edge returns the

448
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
bulk of the media directly so

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
the only thing tunneled is headers and x

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
the heavy duty stuff goes direct

451
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,360
nice layout next

452
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
so this is a

453
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
picture of a generic

454
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
direct server return doesn't have to be

455
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,919
any cast

456
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,280
you have

457
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
user in prefix four

458
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,640
does a request can open the connection

459
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
to

460
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
an address in uh in prefix 3

461
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,120
which lands in the home pub

462
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,559
home pub

463
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,200
forwarded through tunneling to some edge

464
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
pop in prefix 2

465
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
and that h-pop is supposed to

466
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
return back but it's suppose but it has

467
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,960
to source the packets from uh prefix

468
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
three

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
so that the connection is complete uh on

470
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
the client side on the user side

471
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
so prefix 3 is only announced from

472
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,160
autonomous system 1

473
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
but that's the home the has 2 does not

474
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
announce it it doesn't want to announce

475
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,640
it it doesn't want any direct traffic

476
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
for the prefix

477
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
and the question is will as9 which is

478
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
its provider if it does source address

479
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
validation actually permit

480
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,520
um

481
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
dsr is a

482
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,039
pretty pretty

483
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,360
useful use case i mean it's obviously

484
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,919
cdn but so with mobile roaming and some

485
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,200
gaming and

486
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
it could be security products

487
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
uh

488
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
that they're using it and so forth um

489
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,840
okay next

490
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,039
and just some stats for fun um

491
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,240
in 2015 uh we measured

492
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
at several thousand of akamai pubs

493
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
around the world how many of them were

494
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
doing some sort of um

495
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,480
effective uh

496
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
save source address validation and we

497
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,679
found about 15 and just before coming to

498
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,960
this meeting

499
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
i pulled some stats and 2022 it's about

500
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
15 percent

501
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,840
uh so what's happening there um

502
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
economics have been suggested as a

503
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
possibility um but actually for small

504
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
networks

505
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
it is

506
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,080
in the interest not to allow

507
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,039
uh floods of uh spoof packets through

508
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,720
the network so it's not the full answer

509
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,120
uh it's possibly that it's just the

510
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
techniques we have are ineffective

511
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
and

512
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
they break too many things and talking

513
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,320
to operators reducing support calls is

514
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
one of the big incentives

515
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,200
in deploying or not deploying things

516
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,320
okay next

517
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,000
so here is our proposal we call it bar

518
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
cell which is effectively

519
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
using information from bgp obviously but

520
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,000
also augmenting it with aspen raw

521
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
and

522
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
it's first and for first of all is just

523
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
an improvement on 8704 that

524
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
upsex

525
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,440
published two years ago it's effectively

526
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
using

527
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,039
existing data in bgp update messages

528
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,480
better

529
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
uh 8704 was just looking at the

530
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
originals number

531
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
as a signal

532
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
bar save is looking at every single

533
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,039
layers number in the as pass

534
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,679
as a signal uh we can look at it later a

535
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
bit uh how it's doing it

536
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,720
and it's augmenting that information

537
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,960
with uh info in aspen raw and

538
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,280
one one very important thing is

539
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
deployability is key deployability is

540
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
super important

541
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
and

542
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,799
this algorithm requires no change in the

543
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
wire in any of the protocols

544
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
so the very first

545
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
network that adopts it will actually

546
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
reap immediate benefits

547
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,559
uh and

548
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
that's

549
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
that's important

550
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
uh next

551
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
all right uh this is a slightly busy

552
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,280
slide with a lot of circles but its only

553
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
purpose is to say that the algorithm

554
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,799
works equally exactly the same thing

555
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,559
both on uh customer interfaces and peer

556
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,480
interfaces to do

557
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
to come to build a save list

558
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
next

559
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
um high level of how the algorithm works

560
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
it's effectively a two-phase algorithm

561
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
phase one

562
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
you want to discover the customer column

563
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
phase two

564
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,039
now that you have a set of as numbers in

565
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
your customer code you want to discover

566
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,919
prefixes that they own

567
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,720
how do you discover a customer cone

568
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
you start with a single yes number that

569
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,600
you know

570
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,240
which is the as number of your of the

571
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
other side of your interface or your

572
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
customer

573
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
or your lateral peer

574
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
and then you look at

575
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,120
you can look at aspar

576
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,480
and see

577
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
what networks define

578
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,520
this as number to be their provider so

579
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
that's a basically there's a customer

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
relationship

581
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,559
and then you also look at s path of all

582
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,400
bgp messages no matter where they

583
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
received no matter what interface it

584
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,559
could be your peer-to-peer interface it

585
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
could be your from coming from transit

586
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,320
doesn't matter

587
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
um and you see

588
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,520
what

589
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,480
asp look at all the asps and see what is

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,600
the previous s number to this as number

591
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
is in any path and the previous one will

592
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
be it's

593
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
its customer

594
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
so you discover a few s numbers and then

595
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
you repeat the process for the newly

596
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
discovered numbers and you stop when

597
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
there are no more

598
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
new as numbers to discover

599
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
once you're done you have a set of

600
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
your customer code

601
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
when you have a customer call you look

602
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
at raw information and

603
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
find

604
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
all the raw entries that leads the

605
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,919
customer

606
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,200
and you look at all the bgp entries bgp

607
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,360
update messages and just like uh 87.04

608
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,159
uh find where this

609
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,120
uh where an as number in your customer

610
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,960
column is the original number and you

611
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
add those prefixes to your save list

612
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
and you merge everything together and

613
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,919
that's your

614
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,919
save list for the interface

615
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,240
next

616
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,840
all right um

617
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,159
next super busy slide don't read it but

618
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
just the point is that it has a lot of

619
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,240
complex it has a lot of

620
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,640
um different cases it has uh as

621
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
it's got route filtering in it it has

622
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,039
prefixes that are published in raw

623
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,880
prefixes that are not this has

624
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,600
autonomous systems that are that have

625
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
aspar the skeleton system that don't

626
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,520
have aspar

627
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,799
uh what we're going to do is just give

628
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,720
an overview of how the algorithm again

629
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
will work which is uh next

630
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,520
so first you discover the customer code

631
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
you start

632
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,159
you're looking at the

633
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,320
as4 customer interface for with as3 you

634
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
look at the s3 there is nothing in asp

635
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,799
that defines a 3s provider

636
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,760
but there is a bunch of asps

637
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,480
in bgp update messages and you find the

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
previous as numbers

639
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,960
you saw you discovered a few new

640
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
autonomous system numbers

641
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
iteration two

642
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
for all the new ones okay well now we

643
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
discovered that as1

644
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,200
and as2 are listed as providers for

645
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,159
a few

646
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,159
autonomous systems you add them to the

647
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,360
list

648
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,960
you look at bgp

649
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,919
well as6 is listed again great well uh

650
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,799
s7 now you discovered a7

651
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,400
one more path

652
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
you just covered nothing new

653
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,400
fine you have your customer cone

654
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
next

655
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
now you look at for each s number in

656
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,279
your customer cone

657
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,600
you look up raw

658
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
you find prefixes

659
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,039
you look up

660
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
you look at all your rib effectively for

661
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,039
every

662
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
interface

663
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
and you discover

664
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
a few more prefixes where

665
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,880
this autonomous system numbers are

666
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,919
in the origin in the origin place

667
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,880
and

668
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,320
you you got yourself list

669
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
next

670
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,720
now we can go back to the example we've

671
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,919
seen before

672
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
i mean it's kind of a very trivial

673
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,120
example so

674
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,159
uh

675
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,559
8704 wouldn't discover uh prefix 2

676
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,159
but

677
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,480
barcelov will easily do that uh it will

678
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,000
build the customer code it will

679
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
trivially find the ts2

680
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,720
is in this customer cone even if there

681
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,480
was like some intermediate system

682
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,600
between s2 and s4 it would just find

683
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,159
this too by following

684
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,159
the rules and once it knows that there's

685
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,240
two in its customer column

686
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
it will use the bjp update message from

687
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
its peer

688
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,679
to see that our prefix 2 is originated

689
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,840
by as2 so add it to the save list

690
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,880
next cdn example um

691
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,240
well

692
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
our cdn owns

693
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
both autonomous systems one and two and

694
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,880
it owns prefixes one two and three

695
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,200
so what it needs to do is it needs to

696
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
publish raw

697
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,600
that says that autonomous system 2

698
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,640
owns

699
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,520
can advertise effectively prefixes 2 and

700
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
3. now it never means to advertise

701
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
prefix 3 it never will but by the virtue

702
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
of it being in raw

703
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
uh barcelona will pick it up now that

704
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,120
the

705
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
autonomous system nine knows that as2

706
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,840
is its customer because it sees prefix

707
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,320
and from raw it will

708
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
pick up prefix 3 it also belongs in to

709
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,640
prefix 2 and therefore

710
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,440
direct server return will work fine

711
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
because

712
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,799
prefix 3 is known

713
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,640
to be in the sub list for that interface

714
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
next

715
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
now looking at having aspar

716
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
will actually help you

717
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
find route leaks

718
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
obviously that's kind of one of its main

719
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
purposes

720
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
and it also can be used and also would

721
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,240
be used by barcelov algorithm by

722
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,159
effectively

723
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,559
checking

724
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,919
the path so in this example you have as2

725
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,440
which has

726
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,480
leaked a route from its peer

727
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
so the route to

728
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,960
the so the red one uh

729
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,200
the route for prefix five

730
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,320
has been leaked to as9

731
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,480
but the when as4 is doing bar save

732
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,919
and

733
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,520
first thing it will do

734
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
is to check aspa

735
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,799
so when it's seeing s2

736
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,399
it sees that

737
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,559
uh well when c is

738
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,440
a prefix that has s8

739
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,880
and as2 is after it in the

740
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
path

741
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,840
but s8 is found in aspa

742
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,559
but

743
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,520
as2 is not its provider

744
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,279
so first of all of course this this

745
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
route shouldn't have ever been even

746
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,840
accepted for forwarding

747
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
but it will also

748
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,080
not be used so this uh as2 will never be

749
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
added as

750
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,000
so s s 8 will never be added as a

751
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,799
customer of as2

752
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,799
and

753
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,960
so therefore as8 and therefore s5

754
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,840
will not be in the customer cone so s5

755
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
is not going to be allowed in the save

756
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
list on s4 to s

757
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
as2 interface

758
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,000
that said

759
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
in the draft we say that hey if that

760
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,279
prefix actually made it to as4 for some

761
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,480
reason

762
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
um you could still infer

763
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,679
uh

764
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,559
that

765
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,919
as9

766
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
well s9 is a provider for s2 so s2 is a

767
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
customer of s9

768
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
we obviously will ignore um

769
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
s2 to as8

770
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
but we can if for whatever reason we

771
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,520
need to

772
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
it's still in

773
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,679
we could use information saying that s5

774
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,600
is a customer of s8

775
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
now in our search it would never it was

776
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,679
never needed in a more complex

777
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,720
network

778
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,080
it could have been something that could

779
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,639
have been used

780
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,320
um

781
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,960
okay next

782
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,760
and okay that's uh basically that's the

783
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
highlight of the

784
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,918
proposal

785
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,720
okay questions

786
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,080
silence

787
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
okay

788
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,399
say thank you

789
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
oh and

790
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
the next

791
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,320
presentation is eric

792
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,279
okay let me

793
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,919
slide

794
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,320
okay

795
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
okay thank you my name is eric and

796
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,960
together with

797
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
justin within the room as well

798
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,679
and benoit is on vacation somewhere i

799
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,159
don't know in a beach or in a winery

800
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,080
we wrote this small draft this is most

801
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,159
probably the smallest draft i have ever

802
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,120
written

803
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
so it will be pretty quick

804
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,799
next

805
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,159
so where is it coming from so if you

806
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,159
attended to juice dance presentation

807
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,279
this morning at v6 ops we basically send

808
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,120
packets over the internet to do some

809
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,080
measurement in this case it was for v6

810
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
extension adders but

811
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,039
it does not matter which kind of

812
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
measurement you want to do

813
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,960
basically when you do a measurement over

814
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
the internet you inject synthetic

815
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,159
traffic

816
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,360
the synthetic traffic is in sometimes

817
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,120
real because you want to test the

818
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,519
reaction of the global internet

819
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,399
to some strange packets in this case

820
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
extension headers for instance that

821
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
could be anything

822
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
sending strange packet to the network

823
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,760
may trigger security alert

824
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
sometimes unusual traffic pattern

825
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,440
different size

826
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
or even crush some system of course it's

827
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,880
not the intent of the researcher

828
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,039
sending those red packets those probes

829
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
to crush the systems or trigger alerts

830
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,000
but it's a side effect

831
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
so the thing if we want to do a research

832
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
of an internet in a fair way i think the

833
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
bare minimum is to advertise in the pro

834
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
or something

835
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
who is sending those with packets

836
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
basically claiming it's not an attack

837
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,320
and please contact me if you have an

838
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
issue with this

839
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
next

840
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,640
again the idea is pretty simple five

841
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,159
page

842
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,080
internet draft right

843
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
the goal is to

844
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
have a uri

845
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,559
describing the experiment

846
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,799
with contact details

847
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,279
and some more description

848
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
so dri could be an url

849
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,559
pointing

850
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,039
to some specific text

851
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,279
and we basically there follow

852
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,159
rsc 9116

853
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,159
which is the foodie security so

854
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
basically it has a text file

855
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
human readable could be multiple

856
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,559
language with some keywords telling

857
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,279
phone numbers language description and

858
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,120
so on

859
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,919
could also be that what we used uh in

860
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,679
the james experiment

861
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,800
an uri which is a male 2

862
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,399
or if you're there

863
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,520
a uri

864
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,000
which is the phone number

865
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
because if you do it over the internet

866
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,079
you may receive call at 2am which is

867
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,239
maybe not what you want to do but who

868
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,440
knows

869
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,359
basically it is uri

870
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,839
so next

871
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,480
there are two ways

872
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,359
of putting this uri

873
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,359
one is inband

874
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
so you put this uri

875
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,399
in the packet itself

876
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,320
so for instance

877
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,079
icmp

878
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,040
you can put the uri of useley into the

879
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,560
payload udp same thing

880
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
even tcp syn packets can have data it's

881
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
typically not used by application but

882
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,839
it's a valid packet

883
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
now if you play with extension headers

884
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,359
typically you can create an extra option

885
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
and recognize but you can mark it as

886
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,160
skip

887
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
or ignore

888
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
right so you can get it through

889
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
and it's visible in the packet

890
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
of course if you're doing some

891
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,960
esp

892
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,079
experiments please use espno because if

893
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,480
you put it in the esp payload obviously

894
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,079
it's unreadable

895
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,320
next

896
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,880
so

897
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
how do you put it

898
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,760
what we do if you do the uri

899
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
in the data payload

900
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,640
and you are a load by your experiment to

901
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,880
put it directly after the let's say udp

902
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
or tcp header

903
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
you do it put it there

904
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,760
and you terminate by a null byte

905
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,720
just to be clear now if your experiment

906
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,119
requires you to put some data into the

907
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,880
payload over into the

908
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
extension headers

909
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,960
you put the same uri but you to be sure

910
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,800
that to start where's the start and the

911
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,680
end

912
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
you put a null byte

913
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,760
before and then you'll bite after

914
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
next

915
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,200
if you don't do this and again it's not

916
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,440
rocket science if you are for some

917
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
reason unable

918
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,720
to put this uri in the packet itself

919
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,839
you need to use out of band

920
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,720
you rely either on reverse dns

921
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,200
and you use a well-known

922
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,400
uri

923
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,440
running simply if it's reversing smash

924
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,720
example.net you use a dot well noun

925
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
probing.txt

926
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
test require an ayanna

927
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
section for this which is in the draft

928
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,040
or

929
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,839
if you

930
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,440
cannot do reverse dns for whatever

931
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,640
reason

932
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
run a web server on your

933
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,119
source address obviously with the same

934
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,960
year right there bi right the same path

935
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,680
everyone will notice that https to an

936
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,280
ipv6 address

937
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
is not common right you will not get

938
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
real certificate for it but you can

939
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,280
still run https on the top of it that

940
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,760
would be a cell sign obviously

941
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,520
and i think in the next slide this last

942
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
one

943
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,240
so we use rista and the students and

944
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
myself this

945
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
technique

946
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
based on previous experience

947
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
um suggestions were already received i

948
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
think by fernando and a few others on

949
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,040
the list comments are welcome

950
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,000
it's a very very simple thing

951
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,839
but i think it still

952
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,560
deserves publication as a rfc

953
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,079
the most simple one

954
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,400
again

955
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
so questions and maybe called for

956
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,040
adoption

957
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,200
and hope it was useful

958
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,119
and looks like there are questions yeah

959
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
i see people in the clue so ron

960
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,799
ron can you hear us

961
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,839
can you hear me now

962
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:14,880
yes

963
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
okay

964
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,720
um an unexpected consequence of this

965
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,920
draft

966
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,040
might be that network operators filter

967
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,640
packets that contain the uh uri

968
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,880
it's of no benefit to them to

969
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,560
participate in your

970
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,320
experiment and there is risk involved

971
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
um that may

972
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
bias the results

973
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
of the experiment that you're performing

974
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
have you thought about that

975
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,880
no it wasn't thinking about this but

976
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
that's for sure that

977
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,560
yeah that's a

978
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
to come back on the first presentation

979
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,440
there's a kind of indicator of a

980
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,640
compromise

981
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
uh somehow so it could be detected as an

982
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,599
attack on

983
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,200
or even could be proved as a dropping

984
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,440
packet so improving the quality of

985
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
service for these packets to

986
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,160
say hey this isp is better than others

987
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,440
who knows

988
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,960
yeah that's the first statement uh it

989
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,800
deserves at least to say it in a power

990
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,720
graphene or in a section in the draft

991
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,200
thank you ron

992
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,920
okay

993
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,640
yes hi nalini elkins um so so um eric

994
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,720
what well this is a

995
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
potentially a good idea what would stop

996
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,400
me from putting in the name and phone

997
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,440
number

998
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,880
of for example my ex-husband with whom

999
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
i'm having a custody battle

1000
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,800
yeah

1001
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,240
i don't know what your ex husband has

1002
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
done right

1003
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,359
i i understood that the reason why i put

1004
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,720
another joke on it

1005
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
i hope at least

1006
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,000
yeah of course it's good way i mean

1007
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,160
doing this is a good real thing reacting

1008
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
on it is a good real thing

1009
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
as an

1010
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,119
basically when

1011
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,040
twice in my lifetime i generated those

1012
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,480
kind of packets

1013
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,359
right

1014
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,839
and i think

1015
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,920
as a goodwill researcher you want to do

1016
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
something good for the network and you

1017
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,640
do this

1018
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,720
like every mechanism can be bypass right

1019
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,520
so

1020
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,640
you can put example.com or google.com as

1021
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,440
google is there as your uri or the email

1022
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,760
address of of jen right that's for sure

1023
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,280
yeah let's put jen's address yeah

1024
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,920
so you said you did this for the v6 ops

1025
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,000
james thing correct which one of them

1026
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,760
did you do and did anybody ever contact

1027
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,920
you nobody has contacted us and we were

1028
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,040
using the mail to uri

1029
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,599
in-band

1030
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,400
not only because it's short right

1031
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,359
okay

1032
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,280
uh nalini are you in the queue

1033
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,000
intentionally or you just i can't remove

1034
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
you just

1035
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,400
okay

1036
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,400
fernando

1037
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,760
i won't necessarily say that i remotely

1038
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,480
i

1039
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
regularly send these packets but let's

1040
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,319
say that i know people that regularly

1041
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,400
send this kind of packets

1042
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,680
and um

1043
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,520
you know that the well you know in

1044
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,839
theory it seems to be a good idea you

1045
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,400
know the the challenge that i find is

1046
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,359
that

1047
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,720
uh quite often

1048
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,839
it do affect the proof packets that

1049
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,760
you'd be sending like for example just

1050
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
to you know pick on one specific example

1051
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,839
but that's just because i hear

1052
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,079
it during the presentation

1053
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,079
if you uh include data in a sin packet

1054
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,640
there are systems that might process the

1055
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,280
packet differently as they do without

1056
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,160
the you know the the data in the you

1057
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
know sync packet itself

1058
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,520
uh

1059
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,160
what i know that people do when they

1060
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,400
want to be let's say friendly about the

1061
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,119
experiments they do is you know if they

1062
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,520
are you know going to pull the network

1063
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,440
from you know some address

1064
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,599
is you know on the one hand you know

1065
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
configure uh the uh reverse dns mapping

1066
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,240
mappings for the address that you use

1067
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,359
for the probes and then host a website

1068
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,880
on that address

1069
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
such that you can explain in that

1070
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
website you know what it is it that

1071
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,720
you're doing you know what you are doing

1072
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
it for and and so on

1073
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,240
uh

1074
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,599
on the one hand because probably you

1075
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
know the people that detect these things

1076
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,480
they

1077
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,400
test you know they go directly there

1078
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,599
just to check

1079
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,319
and the other second because in that way

1080
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,160
you are not affecting the proof packets

1081
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,560
themselves

1082
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,200
that's a fair point for the in-band

1083
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,520
use of it and the out-of-band it's

1084
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,599
either you run it on the root i mean the

1085
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,520
root of the web server or use the dot

1086
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,480
well known

1087
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,160
probing.txt right yeah yeah yeah we

1088
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,399
agree

1089
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
thank you

1090
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,760
hi uh robert story is i had uh two

1091
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,880
comments

1092
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,240
um

1093
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
on when on the in band have you thought

1094
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
about maybe putting some kind of

1095
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,680
identifier

1096
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,319
in the packet uh to to for people to

1097
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,280
for example maybe something like

1098
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
wireshark or tcp dump to be able to

1099
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
recognize what's in the packet and show

1100
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,680
it because a lot of people they look at

1101
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,280
a raw packet dump they're not going to

1102
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,640
go to the effort they see some ascii

1103
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,720
they may or may not delve further but if

1104
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
wireshark or something automatically

1105
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,359
call it out like a magics exactly or

1106
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,280
something like that right exactly six by

1107
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,760
the time right um and speaking to the

1108
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,440
earlier point where people could be

1109
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
filtering that could be considered a

1110
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,560
feature um most people that are doing

1111
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,480
research projects allow people to opt

1112
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
out and having the identifier they'll be

1113
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,720
able to recognize those packets there's

1114
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,319
a reason discussion on nano about this

1115
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,480
very thing by somebody very irate at

1116
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,720
getting some packets so uh i think that

1117
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
that could be considered a feature

1118
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,880
yeah i i do agree thank you for the

1119
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,720
suggestion

1120
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,680
yeah i'll hijack myself to the

1121
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,560
uh no hats on i'm just thinking that

1122
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,359
uh

1123
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,000
iranian web server or something on the

1124
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,240
source address of the probe probably

1125
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,400
wouldn't be always feasible if you have

1126
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,880
a lot of vantage points like arri patlus

1127
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
right you're like no way you're gonna do

1128
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,720
it on your like every single day dynamic

1129
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,119
yeah yeah yeah so i don't think it's

1130
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,760
like in general like feasible approach

1131
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,280
because i think most of the measurements

1132
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,040
actually done from a lot of different

1133
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,720
vantage points instead of the quran

1134
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,520
measurement from one single thing

1135
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,119
and the other point on this if you're

1136
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,160
using v6 you typically have a slash 64

1137
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,079
and you can get to the power 64 right

1138
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,760
now you can see that's all under the

1139
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,800
reverse dns on this map watch it

1140
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,480
uh eager are you insecure

1141
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,359
so i think it's a good idea to

1142
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,359
it's an interesting at least idea to put

1143
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,079
a

1144
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,960
flag something that says i'm not part of

1145
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,200
any production flow i'm

1146
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,800
a test experiment

1147
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,319
but any

1148
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,960
just to echo that any identifier that

1149
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
names an individual or a project

1150
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,839
because if you do that i'm expecting

1151
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,480
that i'll have to create a identifier

1152
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
address validation draft

1153
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,079
because again same problems yeah but

1154
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,319
keep it right my point is keep it cool

1155
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,920
and simple right there's a good real

1156
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,240
thing better than offering basically

1157
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,160
thank you yeah warren kumari again yeah

1158
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,440
i think we should be careful that we

1159
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,880
don't end up with the perfect being the

1160
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,040
enemy of the good right like

1161
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,640
at the moment there is no useful

1162
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
attribution even if it's not perfect

1163
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,839
even if it doesn't work under all

1164
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,520
conditions even if some people don't

1165
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,680
want to use it because it adds data at

1166
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,520
least it's something that people can use

1167
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,640
if it works for them so yeah

1168
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,960
thank you

1169
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,040
so i assume you'd like adoption call

1170
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,599
right on the draft okay yeah

1171
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,000
okay we'll run it on the list last

1172
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,079
quarter option on the list after this

1173
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,440
atf so

1174
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,640
thank you

1175
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,599
so

1176
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,760
that's all on that gender any other

1177
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,599
business suggestions

1178
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,079
warren

1179
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,000
warren

1180
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,440
turn the mic around

1181
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,359
actually yeah i'll just stand here

1182
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,119
so hey all i am the ad for opsec

1183
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,640
and i've been doing

1184
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,440
the

1185
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,920
80 thing for quite a while now

1186
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,640
my term is up in march

1187
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,119
i will probably run again but i'd really

1188
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
really really like some people to run

1189
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,920
against me

1190
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,079
and so if anybody's even potentially

1191
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,240
interested in serving as opcady please

1192
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,000
come along and talk to me

1193
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,760
and i'm more than happy to explain to
