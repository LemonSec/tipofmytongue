00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,240
presenters with us

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,079

okay i'm gonna turn it over to you

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,680
well uh we all remember

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,399
the content so uh

27
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,639
so the first thing is the node well uh

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,920
document that is common to all iit

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
ietf and irtf meetings

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
um

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
i'm not gonna read

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
okay in detail you will find it in the

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,330
data tracker

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,120
[Music]

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
that is not different from other

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
meetings

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
and then there is privacy and code of

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
contact that you have to

39
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,760
follow

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
basically work just respectfully with

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
others and

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,239
and the

43
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,480
code of conduct and the anti-harassment

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
procedures

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
you know the irtf has is slightly

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
different from the ietf

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
because we focus on on long-term

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
research issues

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
um

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
whereas idf is more focused on

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
short-term

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
and um and that we conduct research and

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
we are not a standards development

54
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,640
organization

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
we can also publish rfc documents

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
and but there's some additional

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,040
information in case you're interested

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
and particularly specifically about the

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
gaia group

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
um

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
so you see the charter

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
uh mentions a

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
study from internet society from 10

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
years ago but the situation hasn't

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
changed

66
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
quantitatively

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
or qualitatively enough

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
to make this charter

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
out of date it's still

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,280
about how the population is not able to

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
access the internet

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
i see they should

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
what they would need and then the

74
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,480
objectives is about

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
the possibility of the issues

76
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
about creating a shared vision

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
regulating collaboration document

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,959
experiences and research results

79
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,680
as

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,760
we have today in the program

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
and document costs and

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
develop a perspective

83
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
about

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
how we can influence the idea of

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
work and and others

86
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,918
to address the problem

87
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
and and this is the agenda so this is

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
what we are doing now uh

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
the the first

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
bullet point and by by the way one of

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
the points is is the minutes uh taker

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,479
is there anyone willing to to do that um

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,960
given that in addition the tool allows

94
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
multiple writers so

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
is there anyone

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
uh

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,120
without exclusive access to to take some

98
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
notes it will help us to produce the

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
minutes later

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
so if you want to um

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
there's a website

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
which is this

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,980
uh notes idf

104
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,280
[Music]

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
you can access with your

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,479
idf login and then uh this is the

107
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
starting point from the minutes so if

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
anyone is interested

109
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
uh locally or remotely

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
um

111
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
i copy it in the chat

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
the url although it doesn't oh yeah it's

113
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
already there

114
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,400
okay so

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
so that's uh that's from my side

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
um

117
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,360
so perhaps we can move to the first

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
presentation

119
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
everyone that

177
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
made these

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
meetings

179
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,520
possible and the great continues i will

180
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
keep participating is simply

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
changing uh position in the room so i'm

182
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
looking forward to meeting you

183
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
face to face hopefully soon

184
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
so uh

185
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
very many many years of service to the

186
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
group i very much do appreciate it

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
it's been a pleasure i learned so much

188
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,199
and it's like a

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,400
great

190
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
and i hope uh

191
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
i hope curtis will enjoy as well as as i

192
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,639
did

193
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
okay so then then i'm gonna give you a

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
screen access

195
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,880
and i'm gonna stop showing my screen

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
that i think is required

197
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,440
thank you

198
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
all right i'm just uh changing my screen

199
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,120
so

200
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
now you can see your screen yes okay

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,600
let's change to my

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
view to the full

203
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
size

204
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
should we give penny a two-minute

205
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,839
warning close to the time or should we

206
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,640
set the timer

207
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,720
every speaker has about 20 minutes and

208
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
then we have q a

209
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
okay

210
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
yeah thank you everyone i hope you can

211
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
see my screen well

212
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
if you have some issues of not seeing

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
the screen please let me know

214
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
so

215
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,480
it's my pleasure to talk about

216
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
today's topic of my presentation

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
about satellite integrated community

218
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
networks and i will talk about the uh

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
the management gap that are existing

220
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
in the in this paradigm i will talk

221
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
about with autonomous maintainability so

222
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
just a brief introduction to myself i'm

223
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,399
a uh a general professor at uh the

224
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
charities school of computer science as

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
well as the department of

226
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
stats and the curio uh science at the

227
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,040
university of waterloo canada i'm also

228
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
a research officer

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
in digital technologies research center

230
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
at national research research council

231
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
canada

232
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
so here is the outline of my

233
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
presentation first of all i'm going to

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,680
talk about the broadband gap that can be

235
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
bridged with

236
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
the advanced satellite networks and then

237
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
i would talk about the satellite

238
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,160
integrated

239
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
community networks and followed by the

240
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,320
management gap identified uh and also

241
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,120
the

242
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,440
autonomous maintainability as a

243
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
important step

244
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
to realizing the uh

245
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,800
the management challenge existing in the

246
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
sics

247
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
and i will give a proof of concept in

248
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
terms of a case study and i'll make a

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
conclusion and end

250
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
so just to give us a quick updated view

251
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,519
of uh the current two large low earth

252
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
orbit satellites

253
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
in uh short animations what you can see

254
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,110
that is the uh um

255
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,279
[Music]

256
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,560
they are

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,120
actually sorry i think there's some

258
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
issues right here

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
oops

260
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
maybe you have to uh

261
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
bear with me for a second

262
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
i have to bring it back

263
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,959
somehow

264
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,800
sorry about interruption

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,880
i think there's a there's an issue about

266
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
video playing

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
of the system anyway so we can see there

268
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
there are two

269
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,800
low earth orbit satellite constellations

270
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
that are up and running in our outer

271
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
space of earth

272
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
and what you just saw is the animation

273
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,160
which runs faster 28 times faster than

274
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
its normal speed

275
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
and what we can see here is that the leo

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
satellites in these constellations are

277
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,240
moving and they can have global coverage

278
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
so in this slide we can see some

279
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,839
examples of the advanced satellite

280
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
platforms

281
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
and the recent revamped interest for

282
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,399
satellite communications

283
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
actually results from the reduce the

284
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,760
cost for space launches and enhance the

285
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,560
capability of hardware platforms that

286
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
makes the broadband satellite internet

287
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,680
possible

288
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,399
and

289
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
for those examples we can see they are

290
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
actually nano and small satellites

291
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,840
as small as a shoe box size or

292
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
[Music]

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,760
and or either very light weight as we

294
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
see from example from

295
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
spacex sterling constellation as well as

296
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
the telesat

297
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
satellite constellations both are

298
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
representative

299
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
satellite constellations

300
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
and um they will form a network in large

301
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
or mega constellations in space when

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
they are fully launched

303
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
and the median earth wobbly satellites

304
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,839
and geo satellites are also gets

305
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
enhanced recently

306
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
so there are two examples shown here

307
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,519
one is the ses high throughput satellite

308
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,320
with

309
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,199
um

310
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,399
30 000 steerable beams supporting 50

311
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,040
megabytes per second to 10 gigabits per

312
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
second data rate

313
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
and the other one is the immerse at very

314
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,880
high throughput geo satellites

315
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
so with those advanced uh systems of

316
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
course there are other enabling

317
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,000
technologies on the user terminal side

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
as well with all those

319
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
innovations

320
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,079
and improvements that are made to the

321
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,480
satellite communication systems

322
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
we can actually now

323
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,440
provide very high quality internet

324
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
connection

325
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,199
to the rural and remote communities

326
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
and we can see that it has satellite

327
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
networks has long been a key

328
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,000
connectivity option for community

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
networks on a global scale and in the

330
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
report

331
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
of broadband coverage in europe 2017

332
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
satellite broadband is considered the

333
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
most pervasive technology in europe

334
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
europe in terms of overall coverage and

335
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
we can see other uh similar you know

336
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
coverage and cases

337
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
around other places of the world

338
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,079
and the development of the satellite

339
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,959
networking technology also matched the

340
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
recent developments

341
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,079
over the different technical communities

342
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
for example 3gpp has been looking at the

343
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
integration of leo satellites or

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,040
non-terrestrial networks into the 5g and

345
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
beyond infrastructure

346
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
and internet society in this year's

347
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
annual plan they have uh

348
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,759
also mentioned

349
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,320
the exploration of looking at leo

350
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,560
satellites for community networks or

351
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
satellite networks

352
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,519
so with the international efforts on

353
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,519
closing the broadband gap for digital

354
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
divide including the implementation of

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
new satellite networks and

356
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,199
communications infrastructures in rural

357
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,959
and remote areas a traditional

358
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,480
satellite-dependent community networks

359
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
or sdcns are envisioned to be trans

360
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,480
transforming into a

361
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,440
satellite integrated cn sicn featuring a

362
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
integration of heterogeneous networks

363
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
and segments to provide broadband

364
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,959
resilient and agile end-to-end

365
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
connections as a example simple example

366
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,360
show

367
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
here

368
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
we can see this sicn architecture in

369
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,680
different parts for example edge

370
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,920
backhoe and the backbone segments

371
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,120
between cn users and its providers

372
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,440
and the cns are connected to the edge or

373
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,399
access network with at least a satellite

374
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,920
front end and backhaul links provided by

375
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
the

376
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,279
satellite itself and also it has

377
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
optional terrestrial network connections

378
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,600
uh uh which while all connected to the

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
backbone of the internet including the

380
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,670
service providers

381
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,040
[Music]

382
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
so the edge and the backhaul portions

383
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
represent the most possible places

384
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,879
of course actually

385
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,799
uh types for example fixed networks uh

386
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,799
like copper or cable and fiber optical

387
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,520
options and wireless networks including

388
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
cellular and microwave options

389
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
so and and so forth

390
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
this is the geographical view of sdcns

391
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
where the blue dots denote

392
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
the communities with satellite

393
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
connectivity in canada and the u.s

394
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,160
based on the 2020 national broadband

395
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
data canada and the acs internet

396
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
connectivity data in the u.s

397
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
this view shows the sdcns are

398
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
scattered over the continent which

399
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
also gives us a view or indication where

400
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
the satellite independent community

401
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,959
networks can be based on

402
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,320
so talking about the sistine paradigm we

403
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
will realize there are

404
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
many technical challenges

405
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
and how to ensure for example how to

406
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
ensure the performance metrics and

407
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
different service level agreements in

408
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
terms of the latency that rates

409
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
reliability as well as the fairness

410
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
is very important

411
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
and

412
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
it can also introduce the complexity in

413
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
communication and computation for

414
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
example

415
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
with the introduction of space assets

416
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
with high dynamics in terms of velocity

417
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
access estates in the routes and the

418
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
signal propagation impairments caused by

419
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,799
atmospheric conditions

420
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,919
and system heterogeneity in payloads how

421
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,240
to ensure a reliable and resilient

422
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
communication is important

423
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,080
and the new computing scenarios will

424
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
emerge as well

425
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
because we have different nodes in space

426
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
air and ground components

427
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
and how to use those nodes to facilitate

428
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
some new computation

429
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
paradigms or scenarios

430
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,080
for example nowadays the the satellites

431
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,799
are using software-defined radios and

432
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,720
also they're going to employ the

433
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,480
software-defined networking technologies

434
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
and that well really gives us really

435
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
interesting discussions about the new

436
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
architectures and computing

437
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
and also with increasing adoption of ai

438
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
algorithms in networking the data will

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,799
be a challenging part to resolve for

440
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
sicns

441
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
due to the fact that some parts of the

442
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
management data for example in satellite

443
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
networks parts may be scars

444
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,600
and of course there are security

445
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,159
challenges as well where vulnerabilities

446
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
can occur in different network

447
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
infrastructural

448
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,159
segments and protocols and algorithms

449
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
running on top of that

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,760
will be a challenge in design

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
and we also have the network management

452
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
considered as a big challenge uh as well

453
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
especially

454
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
when the network gets more complex where

455
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,799
maintenance resource management and

456
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
orchestration for different parts of the

457
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
integrated network need to be done

458
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
efficiently

459
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,039
and also

460
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,080
uh the governance model while gets

461
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
changed uh or we need to put more

462
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,679
thoughts into the into the model based

463
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
on the multi-state holder model that

464
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
internet has been based on

465
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
and because we have multiple

466
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,360
stakeholders uh in the uh in the model

467
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,280
such as network operators community

468
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,320
users

469
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,439
stakeholders and service providers etc

470
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
and now i'm going to focus on the uh

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,159
talking about a management gap that are

472
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
existing for sicns as we are

473
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,039
trying to bridging the broadband gap

474
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,720
which is now possible

475
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
uh nowadays with the technologies and

476
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
connective options right now

477
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
where there is a hidden or

478
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
management gap in community networks

479
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
that needs to be addressed especially

480
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
for sicns where the autonomous

481
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,520
maintainability is an essential step to

482
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
achieving this goal

483
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
due to the fact that the community users

484
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,640
often suffer from the uh the poor

485
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
maintenance efforts or responsive

486
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
maintenance efforts and also there's a

487
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
lack of technical support always in

488
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,559
there

489
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,400
so the autonomous maintainability or

490
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,919
self-maintainability can be viewed as a

491
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
capability to monitor and diagnose

492
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,880
itself and maintain its functions in

493
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
case of failures or performance

494
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,640
degradation

495
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
and we have seen that their relevant

496
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
discussions from different organizations

497
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
such as the standards different

498
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,799
development organizations from itu-t

499
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679
etsi and also ourselves

500
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,799
ietf the concept and now so uh talking

501
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,280
about self-maintenance uh i would like

502
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
to propose a hierarchical approach to

503
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,440
that

504
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,400
so here the concept of this approach

505
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
uh is shown in this diagram they're

506
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
basically two parts of the diagram one

507
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,559
is the uh on top is the machine learning

508
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
pipeline

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
and the other parts is the hierarchical

510
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,120
view of how those results gets

511
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,559
introduced

512
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
to help with the normally identification

513
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,880
step

514
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
and then once we identify the anomalies

515
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
correctly and efficiently we can

516
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
execute some anomaly mitigation schemes

517
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,640
specific to the sicns

518
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,440
so overall the machine learning based

519
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,159
multi-class classification problem will

520
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
be formulated as a unified way of

521
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,320
handling network intrusions faults

522
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,799
detections localizations

523
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
as well as service system reliability

524
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,280
analysis for the anomaly identification

525
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
phase

526
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,799
and the features extracted from the

527
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,480
network flows can be used to predict the

528
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
network states where the multiple

529
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
network anomalies caused by different

530
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
factors can be considered

531
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,799
and the class labels

532
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,720
represent the states in the data sets

533
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
so the states of uh of the network can

534
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
be normal or abnormal states or it can

535
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
be extended into multiple fine-grained

536
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
states

537
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
depends on the applications

538
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,080
so illustratively the self-maintenance

539
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,480
process i'm talking about can be split

540
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,159
into three phases

541
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
identification planning and execution

542
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
and we can see in the presence of a good

543
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,720
mitigation scheme that can be provided

544
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
by a backup connection during the time

545
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,640
period for repairs the time taken for

546
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,360
anomaly identification denoted by t

547
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
right here

548
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,880
is important the last time the better

549
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
now comes to the uh kind of a proof of

550
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,159
concept setup because we wanted to know

551
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,000
if or how

552
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
the machine learning algorithm can help

553
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,840
with a

554
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
self-maintenance scenario following the

555
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,279
hierarchical approach design

556
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,960
in this case we set up a sicn in a

557
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,880
emulated environment

558
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
where satellite entities and routers are

559
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
based on the mininet virtual machines

560
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,159
and satellite and the fixed connection

561
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
backhoes labeled as

562
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
n0 and n1

563
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,679
are connected to an sicn including three

564
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
communities on the very left represented

565
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
by local networks

566
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,640
n52n7

567
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
and the backbone backbone service

568
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,200
provider networks n2 to m4 are shown on

569
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
the right

570
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
and n5

571
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,880
represent

572
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
an

573
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,279
sicn setup with cellular distribution

574
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
and n6 represents the

575
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,320
classic uh the traditional sdcn setup

576
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,080
and n7 represents another sic setup with

577
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,400
the connection diversity provided by

578
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,679
satellite

579
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
and fixed connections

580
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,600
and each router here were added to each

581
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,240
network as an autonomous assistant to

582
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,120
generate and lock bgp traffic because

583
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,679
it's very representative traffic

584
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,679
uh we wanted to know uh to see the

585
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
potentials of whether we can use that

586
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
for um for these self-maintenance uh

587
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
case study

588
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,400
and the traffic flows from the service

589
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
provider to community network and users

590
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,080
are through in one to n0

591
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,320
just to show the brief experimental

592
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,240
results the table on the left shows the

593
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
indicate that uh

594
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,760
there are promising

595
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
machine learning algorithms available

596
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
so there generally are recurrent neural

597
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
network methods and example measures

598
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
specifically they are gru and lstm

599
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,840
for rn models and

600
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
xg boost and rf random forest

601
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,000
for the example method immersion

602
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,039
learning

603
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
and also we can see that with the

604
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,120
hierarchical approach where we

605
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,159
expand experimented with the public

606
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,320
network intrusion data as well as our

607
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
own

608
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,360
generated data through that network

609
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
emulation for bhp traffic

610
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,400
we can see that that there are

611
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,760
performance uh improvements by using the

612
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,919
hierarchical approach as shown in the

613
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
pipeline in the previous slide so all

614
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
for all those uh

615
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
you know top performing

616
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,799
machine learning method they can all

617
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,320
have uh the

618
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,520
improvements in terms of accuracy the in

619
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,279
terms of the key performance metrics

620
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
such as accuracy f1 score and the

621
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
training time

622
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,399
so here i also added the bls broad

623
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,960
broad learning system as a comparison

624
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
because this is also one of the

625
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,039
promising top performing methods

626
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,120
for conclusion

627
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
we can see that community networks are

628
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,000
expected to have increasing integration

629
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
with the space and terrestrial

630
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,159
components brought by the advanced

631
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
satellite networks and communication in

632
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
the form of satellite integrated

633
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
community networks sicns

634
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
and sicn as a paradigm

635
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,480
can provide a promising configuration

636
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
for leveraging not only space component

637
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
but also

638
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
ground and ear

639
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
setups

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
and the proposed machine learning based

641
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
hierarchical approach to autonomous

642
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
maintenance for

643
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,360
sic and management shows some promising

644
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
results although they're going to be

645
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,320
some

646
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
room for our future

647
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,439
contributions for sure

648
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,039
and

649
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,279
for this presentation the major

650
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,240
reference is from the reference one

651
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
although all major other references are

652
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
listed right here

653
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,360
thank you very much

654
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
okay sorry you're right on time yeah go

655
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,640
for it andrew sure jane please

656
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,120
are there any questions for peng that

657
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,360
was fabulous i see rajiv and philippe

658
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,720
are on the

659
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,919
they're in the cube but i think you're

660
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,000
speaking after peng so do does anyone

661
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,039
does anyone have a question for peng uh

662
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,520
philippe do

663
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
are you uh

664
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,000
at all concerned about the station

665
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,640
uh if i can jump in uh bang

666
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
hyping up this is basically going back i

667
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
think to i slide seven or eight of your

668
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
presentation where you showed us a

669
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
broadband map coverage map um sorry it's

670
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,600
slide eight correct uh not seven

671
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,679
um when you talked off the coverage

672
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,320
across north america and you showed uh

673
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,799
you know the general distribution of

674
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,000
satellite terminals and sdcns so um i

675
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
found i found one thing very surprising

676
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,480
um canada uh you know being a extremely

677
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
uh you know sparsely populated uh region

678
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,159
i would expect to have had a lot more uh

679
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,640
you know sdcns being deployed over there

680
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
because of the vast distances involved

681
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,080
and even in the united states

682
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
you know the midwest and the mountain

683
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,840
regions seem to have like big gaps in

684
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,039
them

685
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,880
where you'd expect a lot of rural

686
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,360
communities to be there and

687
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,159
they are kind of ideal locations for

688
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,039
satellite based uh bandwidth to go in

689
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,360
but we're seeing a lot of concentration

690
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
on the coasts and in the more densely

691
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,080
populated areas so do you have any idea

692
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
as to why this kind of distribution is

693
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,840
there or is it some anomaly of the

694
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,159
specific data set that was used to

695
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,919
calculate these uh

696
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,360
points yes

697
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
thanks very much for for your question

698
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,760
that's really uh depends on the data

699
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,480
sets i'm using uh right there because

700
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
there are two data sets that actually

701
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
drop from two countries um so they have

702
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,519
different uh magnitude basically and a

703
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
scalar so in the u.s i actually filtered

704
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,919
out the uh some of the

705
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
communities with the user less than 99

706
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
households so that's why maybe you

707
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,320
didn't see a lot of dance the dots

708
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
across the country because of that

709
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,519
because in canada the data scare is

710
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,320
different they're not measured by the

711
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
households they're measured by the

712
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,799
communities the geographical sides

713
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,640
that's where so that maybe the one of

714
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,279
the dots represents uh

715
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,200
hundreds or two thousand people over

716
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
there

717
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,919
yeah so so um

718
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,919
that's fine thing my question is more on

719
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,880
the lines of you'd expect that the east

720
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,960
and west coast in the us because of

721
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
their population density will have a

722
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,039
much higher uh you know distribution of

723
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,760
terrestrial networks and fixed fixed and

724
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
fixed wireless net networks available so

725
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,000
you would expect there to be a

726
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,880
corresponding uh decrease in the need

727
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
for satellite connectivity but that

728
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,600
doesn't seem to be the case right the

729
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
the data is obviously showing something

730
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,559
quite different

731
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,480
so i find that quite surprising i wanted

732
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
your thoughts on that

733
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,279
yes so i i would uh you know this is

734
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,760
based on the uh the data itself there

735
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,840
are some uh specific descriptions you

736
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
can check specifically from this paper

737
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,720
of uh that mentions the data source

738
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,039
and also there are different rural areas

739
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
as well so not only the remote

740
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
communities that are really depend on

741
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,279
that and we should all also realize

742
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,679
there are some uh backbone connections

743
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,080
like fiber optical connections are

744
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,240
extending into different areas of the

745
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,600
country this is very sim true for the

746
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
for canada and northern communities they

747
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,039
are all and some parts of the uh

748
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,519
uh alberta

749
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,440
they have some a lot of projects

750
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,039
regarding the extension of the fiber

751
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,880
optic connections so some of the

752
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
communities are actually merging into

753
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
multiple connectivity options so that's

754
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,480
we're really realistically making the

755
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,440
sicn paradigm

756
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,320
happen actually

757
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
okay thank you peng i think this is a a

758
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,399
great point that you're making

759
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,440
particularly with what we're seeing

760
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
about the importance for redundancy and

761
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,320
resiliency

762
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,919
uh around the planet and having more

763
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,640
than one network available um rajiv are

764
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
you in the queue because uh sorry you're

765
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,960
out of the queue now um philip are you

766
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,120
in the queue to ask a question of peng

767
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,720
we want to keep these pretty short so

768
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,799
that he could answer a couple more

769
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
great um curtis or you're in the queue

770
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
too

771
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,679
so you're up

772
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,960
and join

773
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,120
after curtis

774
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,039
so this was a great talk thank you so

775
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
much peng i'm going to email you out of

776
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
band because i was literally in

777
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
which is one of the dots on here

778
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,919
um about two weeks ago installing a

779
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,360
community network

780
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,200
um and

781
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,599
we're really like just trying to figure

782
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,359
out when starlink will get there and how

783
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,359
how important that'll be

784
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,239
um

785
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
i'm curious about a couple things i

786
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
think this map is interesting because

787
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,520
ostensibly there's a community network

788
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,199
in there i can see the dot

789
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,960
but such a thing doesn't exactly exist

790
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,879
so i think we're using very different or

791
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,359
maybe uh different definitions of

792
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,800
these things because there's a northwest

793
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,839
tel

794
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,359
satellite link in the village that gets

795
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,079
used and everyone complains about but

796
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,399
the big question i have is

797
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,159
about

798
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,918
really the overall methodology i mean my

799
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,440
experience in

800
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,639
community networks has been that um

801
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,399
the failure modes are not things that

802
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,399
require machine learning to

803
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,839
figure out what happened

804
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,760
uh you know unlike situations like

805
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,679
rogers and the

806
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
other failures that are you know

807
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,879
somewhat large in the central core

808
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,720
network it's almost always just the

809
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
power as a problem

810
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,320
or something like that and so

811
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
methodologically what we do is what we

812
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
will be doing here soon is uh going into

813
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
the community and running some training

814
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,720
courses and teaching people about the

815
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
technology and teaching people about hey

816
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,079
that blinky lights off that means you

817
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,400
should probably do something um

818
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,119
how does that fit into

819
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,359
you all's vision of

820
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,079
uh creating resilient networks in these

821
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,480
areas

822
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,320
so uh yeah that's a really good point i

823
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
noticed that some many community

824
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
networks are currently set up in a very

825
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,000
small scale

826
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
and uh and they have their own different

827
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,280
uh problems some are okay with just the

828
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,240
traditional way of solving the issues or

829
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
faults within the network some are

830
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,280
really correlated to other areas or

831
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,599
segments of the network for example

832
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,839
but they do have common grounds they do

833
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,760
have common grounds in terms of machine

834
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,920
learning can be used as a way to

835
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,800
automate this process due to the the

836
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
lack of technical support due to the

837
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
lack of response expectation of

838
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
responsive maintenance efforts to be

839
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,800
done to give them really smooth uh and

840
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,760
uninterrupted internet access experience

841
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,480
so what i imagine is that they're gonna

842
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
there will be some uh transformation

843
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,079
uh due to the current satellite

844
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,160
communications technologies so um but

845
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,640
maybe people can see that oh okay they

846
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,000
have good connection uh to the uh

847
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,720
starlink for example um not promoting

848
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
that service anyways just example to

849
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
have good connection and a good cost

850
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,480
effective

851
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,560
package so for in terms of that um

852
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,280
the maintenance is still uh over there

853
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
because they're gonna be some a lot of

854
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,200
different stakeholders and operators uh

855
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,240
into

856
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,200
uh you know the service for providing

857
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
internet connection to the community

858
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
networks

859
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
and the training regarding the community

860
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,760
network users will be

861
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,400
um to let them know the options and

862
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
connective options uh

863
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,720
maybe there's no one-size-fits-all right

864
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,960
now but uh for the broadband

865
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,200
connectivity options which is the major

866
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,320
focus of of my uh uh researching this

867
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
here uh

868
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
that gonna be uh i think that will

869
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
really need some technological

870
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
advancements in there

871
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,240
did i answer your questions or or

872
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,119
uh

873
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
great thank you so much

874
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,560
thank you awesome

875
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,480
we have about about three to four more

876
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,079
minutes for questions for peng because

877
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,920
we have some other great speakers in the

878
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
queue

879
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,359
so john clinton i see you have a hand up

880
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,800
and you've been patiently waiting and

881
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,880
nabil benamar um i think we're going to

882
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,200
have to lock the queue after an appeal

883
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
so if we could do a quick round with

884
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
pang and peng um if we could keep our

885
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
answers a little short so that we can

886
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,359
also um and let's make sure we have your

887
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,119
email so that we can if you don't mind

888
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,880
putting it in the chat so folks could

889
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
contact you because this was a really

890
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
great presentation and curtis i want to

891
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,160
put on the clipboard your point about

892
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
the definition of cns because that could

893
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
be something we look at

894
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,359
for the next meeting so john clinton

895
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,440
you're up

896
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,680
question for peng

897
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
are you uh

898
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,079
concerned about the impact this work may

899
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
have on the uh on the space junk on

900
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
encouraging more satellites and

901
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,839
consequently the space junk problem or

902
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,800
or is that something you're just

903
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,200
assuming somebody else is worried about

904
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,440
exactly the space junk is one of the big

905
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,359
concern uh i'm doing the research

906
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,880
actually on that area um because that

907
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
really the environmental

908
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,359
space environmental issues

909
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,200
is a big concern for uh for humanity and

910
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
we have seen that though uh

911
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
some act you know some activities have

912
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,480
been done for our european space agency

913
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,119
and globally actually gradually and but

914
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
we are glad to see that it's happening

915
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,079
but

916
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,440
for sure

917
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,760
the space junk needs to be taken care of

918
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,000
an early stage before it's getting worse

919
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,280
thank you pang that's great

920
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
naville benamar

921
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,079
a well-known uh colleague in the ietf

922
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,680
nabil over to you for a question for

923
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,400
peng thank you thank you jane

924
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,680
uh

925
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,280
i'd like um

926
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,599
to ask you just a question about the

927
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,000
simulation setup maybe because you have

928
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
mentioned that you use the mininet with

929
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
vms

930
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,200
and uh

931
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,560
i think that

932
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,760
it can cause some uh issue when we you

933
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,040
want to scale

934
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,480
uh to uh to to use a lot of uh of of

935
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
nodes so

936
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,079
mininet has a limit because of the ram

937
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,640
and all the stuff so i'm asking about

938
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
this and

939
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,880
suggesting if you can

940
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
for further work for future work to use

941
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,480
for example the linux

942
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,359
namespace linux namespace you can go to

943
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,760
thousands of nodes without any uh

944
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,880
problem related to uh to scale

945
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,119
thank you

946
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,800
yeah thanks for the comments i i do

947
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,480
realize there is a limitation in terms

948
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
of compute resources consumed by midi

949
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,839
net vms yes and we really wanted to

950
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,440
scale up uh

951
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,720
maybe thanks for your suggestion

952
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
peng this was a really great

953
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,640
presentation thank you for such a an

954
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
interesting approach and all the great

955
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,319
questions that everyone's been asking

956
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,880
and if you don't mind i think everybody

957
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,560
would love probably your contact

958
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,920
information if you could pop it in the

959
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
chat

960
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,480
and we just want to make sure you're the

961
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
person doing that rather than me or yeah

962
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,760
sure

963
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560
resilient education information

968
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,720
infrastructure

969
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,319

educational information infrastructure

1013
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,480
for you normal

in this presentation i will

1016
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,040
give you the overview of the project

1017
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,319
it's rational

1018
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,560
our technology demonstrators

1019
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
the perceived social and economic

1020
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,319
impacts of this project

1021
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,079
our pilot sites and our current

1022
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,800
implementation challenges

1023
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,599
um

1024
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,079
in the philippines um on the onset of

1025
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,480
the pandemic we have we we have been

1026
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
forced to shift from

1027
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
traditional in-person classes to remote

1028
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,520
and online learning

1029
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
classes

1030
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,040
this

1031
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,319
brought some serious problems because

1032
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,040
we still have this lack of quality

1033
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,200
reliable sustainable additional iso

1034
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,760
infrastructure and this remains as a top

1035
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,359
challenge in the implementation of

1036
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,119
remote and hybrid learning in the

1037
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
philippines

1038
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,000
so the problem is that we had

1039
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
difficulties in educational content

1040
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,160
transmission in remote learning due to

1041
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,760
the unreliable internet connection the

1042
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
philippines as you can see in the slide

1043
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,680
those teachers are actually um

1044
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
um

1045
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,800
in their arms in their cell phones

1046
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,520
searching for a signal

1047
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,880
so the challenge that uh we are taking

1048
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
on at the osdast is to develop

1049
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,839
innovative solutions uh utilizing uhf tv

1050
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,040
channels to provide internet

1051
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
connectivity and to support our remote

1052
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,079
education in the philippines

1053
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,640
so again project rain the focus of this

1054
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,960
project is to develop um

1055
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,720
the solutions that uses uhf tv channels

1056
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,319
to support remote education and to

1057
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,079
provide internet creativity since

1058
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,000
face-to-face classes is still

1059
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,640
limited in the philippines um we haven't

1060
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,119
opened their schools yet

1061
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,079
so uh why uhf tv frequencies uh the

1062
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,240
philippines has yet to fully shift from

1063
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,560
analog tv to digital tv

1064
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
and it's pegged at

1065
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,680
2023

1066
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
so there is an opportunity for us to

1067
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,560
champion for alternative use of to do

1068
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,680
to uh to the to to be vacated spectrum

1069
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,720
specifically at 600 megahertz to 700

1070
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,839
megahertz

1071
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,720
uh for 600 megahertz we are adding

1072
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,520
this frequencies for both um

1073
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,640
lte and new range of band 71 which could

1074
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,560
be used by alternative connectivity

1075
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,200
strategies such as community networks

1076
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
and um

1077
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,480
we could also use this for the isdbt

1078
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,560
standard which the which is the digital

1079
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,000
tv standard we allow them in the

1080
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
philippines

1081
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,960
to implement data casting test

1082
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
broadcasts

1083
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,680
in our recent survey regarding the use

1084
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,760
of ict devices in the philippines last

1085
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,280
2019 um tv and smartphones are almost a

1086
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,280
bit still in the philippines where 78.9

1087
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,839
of filipino households have working tv

1088
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,800
sets

1089
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,920
and 40.9 percent of uh these households

1090
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,040
are within reach of digital tv signals

1091
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,079
while 82.64 percent uh primarily access

1092
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,599
the internet here in the philippines to

1093
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,480
our smartphones

1094
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,520
so um we have uh two technology

1095
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,280
demonstrators that that's what we call

1096
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,400
them for project crane uh utilizing the

1097
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,319
600 to 700 meg

1098
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,880
frequencies the first is locality or the

1099
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,079
local lte which is uh aims to develop a

1100
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,400
low-cost um small scale lte based

1101
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,640
station uh that aims to address the lack

1102
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,480
of internet access in remote conserved

1103
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,240
areas in the country

1104
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,400
uh this technology demonstrator builds

1105
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,319
upon the gains of an earlier project the

1106
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,520
village base station program wherein

1107
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,760
uh we piloted community cellular

1108
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,000
networks uh offering 2g calls and texts

1109
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,760
the second technology demonstrator is

1110
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,079
rural casting wherein we utilize the

1111
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,240
data casting feature of the istbt

1112
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,280
standard

1113
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,599
to deliver educational digital content

1114
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,240
because right now we only utilize the

1115
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,119
isbt to deliver a broader broadcast

1116
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,200
content and we see that

1117
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,400
we can

1118
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,480
use the isdb more

1119
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,520
and

1120
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,680
transmit more meaningful information

1121
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,000
again uh let's focus on the first

1122
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,359
technology demonstrator first

1123
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,079
so here is the system overview of a

1124
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,800
local lte

1125
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,640
[Music]

1126
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,319
the radio access network and the core

1127
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,640
network is co-located at

1128
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,359
in one box

1129
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,960
the user equipment

1130
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,040
the subscriber needs to have a sim card

1131
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,800
that is compatible with the network and

1132
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,640
once you have the user equipment and the

1133
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,000
sim card and you are within the

1134
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,920
network coverage of the network you can

1135
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
access the

1136
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,880
locally

1137
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
locally cached or locally

1138
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
stored educational materials cache

1139
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,000
content

1140
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
and local portals

1141
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,960
for the compute for the radio network

1142
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,280
and the core network

1143
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
we host the lte network monitoring

1144
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,359
control subscriber management

1145
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,800
and uh for this segment uh we are using

1146
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
um an sdr and we are fitting a

1147
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,839
band 71 rf front end

1148
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,359
um

1149
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,359
we connect this to the internet which

1150
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,200
could uh

1151
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,520
be any technology but for the areas that

1152
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,720
we are piloting it we are using um

1153
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,440
a satellite black hole so

1154
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,960
once we connect it to the internet the

1155
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,440
subscribers can access the internet but

1156
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,760
without it uh the subscribers can only

1157
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,800
access the

1158
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,680
locally cached content like videos and

1159
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,440
other educational materials

1160
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
uh for rural casting uh the goal is to

1161
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,559
utilize again data acastic technology to

1162
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,160
supplement the educational experience of

1163
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,359
the students

1164
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,040
uh you can see here in the slide the

1165
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,200
prototype of the

1166
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,680
broadcasting receiver wherein

1167
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,640
they are receiving the broadcast at the

1168
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,559
same time they um

1169
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,400
at the background the

1170
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,559
data casted file is being saved

1171
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,839
by the

1172
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,760
device so again the system overview is

1173
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,040
that um

1174
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,520
we have a set up box where in

1175
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,160
it could be used as a standalone device

1176
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,960
but it also is a wi-fi hotspot wherein

1177
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
other devices can connect to it

1178
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,040
and the setup box hosts a um

1179
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,760
an

1180
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,720
lms like a moodle and it also hosts

1181
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,880
various apps from our partners

1182
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,559
especially

1183
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,839
applications involving the teaching of

1184
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,960
mathematics financial education

1185
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,920
financial inclusion and

1186
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
other specialized

1187
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
educational materials

1188
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,119
now

1189
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,160
we

1190
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,319
envision that our teachers in the

1191
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,960
schools or in the rural areas can have

1192
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,119
their mini transmitters or mini tv

1193
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,760
transmitters so they can conduct remote

1194
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
classes in their schools wherein the

1195
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
transmitters are located and the

1196
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,920
students that have their setup passes

1197
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,200
their homes can

1198
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
continue learning at the comfort of

1199
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,920
their homes

1200
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,079
so the teachers are

1201
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,079
pegged as content creators wherein they

1202
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,880
can upload modules videos and others

1203
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,200
and they can use the mini sdr based

1204
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,119
media transmitters in their school to

1205
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,720
schedule content and to schedule the

1206
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,400
the data or the

1207
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,240
other information that could be data

1208
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,760
casted

1209
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,720
during the broadcast

1210
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,200
so we envisioned that these two

1211
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,000
technology demonstrators

1212
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
will have this uh four social impacts

1213
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,920
better connectivity

1214
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,520
access to information

1215
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,760
health literacy in the context of

1216
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
endemic we need to

1217
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,680
provide

1218
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,079
verified health information to

1219
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,240
to these areas and number four a better

1220
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,040
learning experience

1221
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,200
we also take note of the potential

1222
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,960
economic impacts of these technology

1223
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,040
demonstrators

1224
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,800
additional revenue for the community

1225
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,040
eliminating some market barriers uh

1226
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,280
maximizing market yields

1227
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,880
attack investors

1228
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
and uh

1229
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,160
number five is that we acknowledge that

1230
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,520
uh

1231
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,599
the problems in the community are unique

1232
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,960
to the community and

1233
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,480
they could read innovation with the

1234
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,720
tools that we have and

1235
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,480
we could empower the

1236
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,440
uh

1237
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,040
the uh

1238
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,800
the community members to solve their own

1239
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,200
problems and to breed innovation and the

1240
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,839
sixth impact is the more education a

1241
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,599
more educated workforce

1242
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,440
so we will

1243
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,160
show you some of our pilot sites

1244
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,880
uh we had a set criteria on how to

1245
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,119
select our pilot sites for this project

1246
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,480
uh number one is the absence of

1247
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,480
commercial mobile phone service

1248
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,800
a school that is not more than 500

1249
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,400
meters away from the community with at

1250
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,280
least 50 households

1251
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,640
school officials and members of the

1252
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,160
community are willing to participate or

1253
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,240
participate in cooperating the project

1254
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,640
and no one uh no ongoing uh armed

1255
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,800
conflict

1256
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,640
um ability for possible roads uh stable

1257
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,559
reliable electric power from the local

1258
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,800
unity utility and

1259
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,960
um some open space to host our towers

1260
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,599
so uh one of our pilot sites is a san

1261
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,400
andreas tana result it's a two-hour

1262
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
ride from the capital modula but it has

1263
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,480
no silver signal service because um of

1264
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,520
geographical challenges

1265
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,480
uh the other pilot is for our one of our

1266
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,200
technology demonstrators royal casting

1267
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,359
it's a nearby town from san andreas

1268
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,040
and the

1269
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,640
second pilot for

1270
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,400
local lte is

1271
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
in zambales wherein

1272
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,720
they also had difficulty in having

1273
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,200
cellular service in fact uh in that

1274
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,960
picture that is the only spot in the

1275
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,599
community wherein they could receive

1276
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,480
sms messages

1277
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,200
so we are targeting six other pilot

1278
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,880
communities and nomination of these

1279
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,200
communities is through data

1280
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,000
crowdsourcing wherein we post

1281
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,920
a status and facebook and we would

1282
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,000
verify the information that was sent to

1283
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,119
us through

1284
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,839
various sources

1285
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:54,720
so

1286
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,680
here are just some action pictures of

1287
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,640
the team

1288
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,160
performing spectrum measurements and

1289
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,119
verifications of site surveys

1290
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,040
uh our preliminary testing of our

1291
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,880
technology demonstrators in one of the

1292
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,839
communities in

1293
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,480
tanayrizal

1294
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,319
here is a

1295
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,559
technology demonstration of for our

1296
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,119
teachers and our students using their

1297
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,920
smartphones

1298
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,079
this is also a picture of technology

1299
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,440
demonstrator

1300
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,680
aimed at the community and not just the

1301
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,839
students but the subscriber potential

1302
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,680
subscribers of the network

1303
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,240
here are some groundbreaking activities

1304
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,160
here in the philippines groundbreaking

1305
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,559
activities is a big thing because um

1306
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,440
it

1307
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,839
signifies the start of a project and a

1308
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,480
start of something

1309
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,359
beneficial to the community

1310
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,559
and here are some finnish towers

1311
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,400
for san andreas and

1312
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,440
zambales uh the other uh the one of the

1313
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,359
tower is hosted at

1314
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,119
at top of the building of the school

1315
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,559
where the other is on the ground

1316
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,359
so

1317
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,559
currently uh we are in talks with our

1318
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,760
regulator

1319
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,839
uh for our limited permits in these

1320
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,599
select pilot areas

1321
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,240
and we are hoping for policy changes or

1322
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,240
recommendations for

1323
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,359
government entities such as uost

1324
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,680
performing quasi-telco functions because

1325
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,200
right now

1326
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,160
importation of telco equipment using

1327
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,520
frequencies

1328
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,000
that functions are exclusive

1329
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
for our telco companies

1330
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,880
and with that we had a restricted

1331
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,000
ability uh to import um lte band 71

1332
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,319
commercial of the shelf radios and end

1333
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,200
user devices so we had to

1334
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,400
um

1335
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,880
resort to building our own our front end

1336
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,720
using uh

1337
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,079
and using uh software-defined radios

1338
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,720
and we also have an apartment redundancy

1339
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,359
uh with the free wi-fi program for all

1340
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,240
of the philippines wherein um

1341
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,440
another department is installing uh free

1342
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,119
wi-fi hotspots but we believe that uh

1343
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,119
a sustainable operational model for

1344
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,359
community buy-in or participative

1345
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,359
participating networks

1346
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,599
is a more uh suitable option rather than

1347
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,960
this free wi-fi that

1348
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,440
that is dependent on subsidies all

1349
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,839
around so we want to establish lte

1350
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,440
networks where in the community can

1351
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,599
combine in and participate and operate

1352
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,880
and

1353
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,359
here's pictures of

1354
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,359
our team and

1355
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,079
with that i end my presentation and

1356
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,400
thank you our email is at project green

1357
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
asset usd.page

1358
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,920
and you can follow our updates in

1359

1360
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,440
thank you everyone

1361
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,760
thank you so much um so we can

1362
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,559
we can move to the questions

1363
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,400
i guess i'm first in the queue again

1364
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,720
um hi philip

1365
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,640
uh that's an amazing presentation you

1366
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,720
just gave uh you guys seem to be doing

1367
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,559
some great work uh you know in the

1368
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,680
community

1369
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,839
and uh i just wanted to find out if you

1370
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,799
guys are open to more collaborations uh

1371
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,119
because we are doing some very similar

1372
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,000
stuff you know you will see that when we

1373
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,640
present and uh we'd love to you know

1374
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,720
just kind of touch base with you and

1375
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,680
compare notes because um i'm i'm sure

1376
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,760
each of us will have a lot of learnings

1377
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,880
from our respective uh activities in

1378
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,359
rural communities that you know can

1379
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,920
become a part of the knowledge base as

1380
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,960
we you know build towards serving uh

1381
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,000
more and more communities worldwide

1382
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,920
yeah yeah um

1383
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,079
i think you could leave the email for

1384
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,079
this for so that uh

1385
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,079
we can um

1386
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,640
start our communication basically um

1387
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
uh this is an opportunity for us to

1388
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,839
compare notes actually because

1389
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,680
while decor technology is the same we

1390
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,760
have different um

1391
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
contexts in our deployments

1392
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,720
so we have we our problems might be

1393
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
similar my problems might not that

1394
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,799
similar but at least we can compare

1395
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,880
nodes uh what are the players i'm pretty

1396
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,799
sure

1397
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,559
are going to be significantly different

1398
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,960
because uh we are approaching this from

1399
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,960
an entirely uh non-governmental um you

1400
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,559
know angle where we don't really uh um

1401
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,200
we basically looking at working through

1402
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,359
an existing telco and stuff like that

1403
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,680
whereas you're doing a lot through uh

1404
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,000
you know government programs and the

1405
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,079
ability like you said of

1406
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,040
your organization to become like a quasi

1407
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,720
telco on the back of policy uh you know

1408
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,160
intervention from the government to

1409
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,160
allow you to do things uh quite

1410
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,799
differently from what we are doing so

1411
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,480
like i said a lot of opportunity to

1412
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,240
compare notes

1413
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,839
yes definitely

1414
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,240
all right i'll jump in i think i'm the

1415
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,520
next in the queue

1416
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,599
uh thanks flip thanks for for for

1417
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,760
jumping in here and being helpful uh

1418
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,680
just for everyone in the room uh worked

1419
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,799
for flip for a while he's one of the

1420
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:33,680
best

1421
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,640
um

1422
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,599
and uh i wanted to ask uh you're gonna

1423
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,040
hear me beating the same drum for

1424
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,040
everyone will be coming to gaia of

1425
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,280
technical training using platforms like

1426
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,680
this have i know that your mandate is

1427
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,480
kind of education in the school and

1428
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,680
early

1429
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,040
childhood not really that early

1430
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,880
childhood sense but like have there been

1431
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,040
discussions about learning about how the

1432
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,200
internet works through

1433
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,599
installations like this and how

1434
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,119
in order to help sort of build capacity

1435
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,799
um we have

1436
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,440
been in talks with other groups in the

1437
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,200
philippines wherein

1438
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,079
we really need to have

1439
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,920
an information drive or some materials

1440
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,880
we're in

1441
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,520
uh how to access the internet or how to

1442
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,599
use the internet for the first time or

1443
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,559
how to filter uh the news that you uh

1444
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,440
you receive in facebook or or fake news

1445
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,400
especially here in the philippines

1446
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,520
other groups that signified interest

1447
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,359
to collaborate with us on that aspect

1448

don't know if you want to um no i'm just

1451
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,200
joining the queue since i believe we are

1452
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,960

think it's going to be very useful in in

1464
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,640
in many other locations so and a great

1465

having us um i'm kevin schwartz of geeks

1488
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,520
without frontiers and i helped lead the

1489
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,839
n50 project and as mentioned i'm here

1490
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,839
with rajiv from piconets

1491
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,760
we'd like to share with you both the n50

1492
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,440
project and the learnings from a

1493
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,319
specific project in zambia

1494
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,520
rajiv could you move us to the next

1495
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
slide

1496
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,160
so it's important to know about uh

1497
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,599
infinity project in order to understand

1498
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,119
the work that we're going to talk about

1499
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,240
in zambia um n50 project is a consortium

1500
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,000
of more than 80 organizations they're

1501
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,920
commercial ngo academic and more

1502
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,359
this group includes really large

1503
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,200
international companies such as intel

1504
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,880
dell and phillips

1505
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,640
it also includes important partners such

1506
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,039
as piconets telehealth providers

1507
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,920
education specialists and and even some

1508
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,680
specific niche providers of specific

1509
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,720
technologies and services

1510
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,119
we believe in a few things

1511
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,559
half the world's population is not

1512
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,480
currently using the internet

1513
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,480
and that access is only part of the

1514
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,319
problem it could be that it's relatively

1515
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,359
expensive

1516
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,160
it could be poor internet quality um

1517
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,640
it could be a language barrier it could

1518
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,480
be a lack of digital literacy

1519
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,079
or it could be a lack of relevant

1520
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,079
applications we actually think that last

1521
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,599
one is one of the most important ones

1522
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,920
that we try to focus on

1523
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,039
so in the next slide

1524
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,839
we sort of spell out a little bit of our

1525
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,760
our values and our mission in this

1526
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,119
beginning with communities with the

1527
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,960
source of values and are included from

1528
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,480
the outset

1529
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,920
and while many organizations are

1530
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,000
motivated by goals to help marginalized

1531
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,160
communities no one organization can

1532
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,680
tackle the challenge alone even some of

1533
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,960
these giant organizations that i

1534
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,960
mentioned earlier have all said

1535
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,799
we're better together

1536
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,400
and and we believe that if we can

1537
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,200
demonstrate novel replica solutions

1538
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
using a technology that's available

1539
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,000
today

1540
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,599
at the edge

1541
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,039
and that these include services that

1542
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,039
support the adoption of broadband we can

1543
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,640
create recipes that other communities

1544
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,799
can readily utilize we're not going to

1545
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,359
be able to solve the challenge alone of

1546
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,119
3.9 billion people not currently using

1547
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,280
the internet but if we can create these

1548
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
models that the communities can

1549
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
select and replicate with willing

1550
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,799
partners then we can get there together

1551
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,960
um registered on our next slide you can

1552
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,920
see

1553
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,359
that

1554
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,280
this is the process that we we undertake

1555
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,839
careful curation of projects

1556
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,000
that are focused on a sustainable

1557
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,960
outcome

1558
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,119
blueprints for communities and then

1559
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,640
matching partners with specific

1560
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,160
capabilities to the community's needs

1561
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,920
overall we always invite

1562
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,559
everyone to to join in 50 it's an open

1563
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:11,760
collaboration

1564
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,039
uh without

1565
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,960
fees or dues or things like that it's

1566
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,400
just simply a coalition of the willing

1567
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,960
dedicated to this work and we we may

1568
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,119
have 80 partners but maybe six work on

1569
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,200
one project and seven on another and two

1570
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,359
on another it just depends on on what

1571
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,559
the community challenges that we're

1572
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,200
trying to solve

1573
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,119
on the next slide we can show you a list

1574
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,760
right now as of at least yesterday a

1575
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
list of our partners that we have in our

1576
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,240
in our consortium this list is growing

1577
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,319
uh at a rate of about two or three per

1578
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,119
week as as we are uh

1579
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,880
engaging with partners to to join

1580
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,839
so we have many projects that are

1581
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,760
underway are emerging around the globe

1582
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,000
our highest profile projects right now

1583
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,760
include support for ukrainian refugees

1584
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,000
and displaced persons and also our pilot

1585
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,160
project in luembo zambia and that's the

1586
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,839
focus of our presentation today where

1587
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,079
rajiv will take us shortly to uh to talk

1588
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,400
about how we work to solve the challenge

1589
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,559
in that community

1590
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,000
this is

1591
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,160
lombo is a perfect example of what we

1592
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,760
call the edge

1593
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,520
the location was selected as a way to

1594
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,760
prove out multiple concepts knowing that

1595
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,839
if we were successful in lumbo the

1596
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,119
likelihood of success in other

1597
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,200
communities was actually very high

1598
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,640
rajiv and pico nets were heavily

1599
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,720
involved in this project from the outset

1600
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,240
rajiv can you share with us what you

1601
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,000
found in the womba when you arrived and

1602
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,559
how did the project proceed

1603
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,680
yes so uh one of the biggest challenges

1604
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,640
that

1605
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,720
you know kevin already mentioned earlier

1606
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,559
is that there are a number of factors

1607
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,280
which may be having an involvement in

1608
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,039
saying that there's a community that

1609
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,760
isn't participating in the internet uh

1610
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,079
it was we talked about cost we talked

1611
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,559
about access to devices uh we talked

1612
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,799
about digital literacy

1613
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,359
and all of these factors you know have

1614
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,160
some part to play in the challenge being

1615
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,920
solved so one of the things that we

1616
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,760
really wanted to do

1617
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,400
is uh pick a community where

1618
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,880
it's reasonably small reasonably

1619
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,280
tight-knit which means we can very

1620
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,359
effectively measure and establish a

1621
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,480
baseline

1622
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,200
so that when we start doing different

1623
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,520
things different interventions we can

1624
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,000
see what kind of impact they're having

1625
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,599
so the first stage was obviously working

1626
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,440
with

1627
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,119
a telco who is covering that area

1628
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,400
up until

1629
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,640
just january of this year

1630
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,839
all these people had was 2g and very

1631
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,119
sporty 3g connectivity okay

1632
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,119
nothing beyond that

1633
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,119
so the first intervention was actually

1634
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,079
looking at how the community

1635
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,680
utilization of internet and services

1636
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,559
transitions as 4g started moving into

1637
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,760
the community

1638
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,599
um then

1639
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,000
you know we collected some of that data

1640
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,319
uh you know put that together and then

1641
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,720
we started taking the next step where we

1642
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,359
started seeding the community with

1643
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,079
more devices especially 4g capable

1644
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,359
devices

1645
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,039
both in terms of

1646
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,319
you know bringing in devices for

1647
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,238
targeted communities like the school

1648
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,799
teachers okay or the healthcare workers

1649
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,000
and also to uh bring devices into the

1650
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,040
general community um you know bring in

1651
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,759
specialized tablets and computers into

1652
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,238
the schools uh you know both the primary

1653
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,640
as well as the secondary schools um in

1654
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,040
the community and all of these are

1655
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,759
things that we are looking at um with

1656
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,839
every intervention we are collecting a

1657
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,759
lot of data we're collecting usage

1658
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,560
trends because all of this is eventually

1659
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,158
going to go into

1660
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,359
our report that will help like kevin

1661
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,399
said build a template that can be reused

1662
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,560
by other communities as they look to

1663
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,560
improve their own connectivity and

1664
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,000
digital literacy um the next step for us

1665
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,198
is to actually go uh and address the

1666
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,719
content side

1667
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,319
of the equation okay which is hey

1668
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,000
you now have access you now have devices

1669
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,520
but what are you going to consume with

1670
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,359
that access and those devices that you

1671
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,040
have right so uh that is where we really

1672
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,120
wanted to drive uh specific and

1673
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,679
very relevant content and

1674
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:32,238
allow the community to start consuming

1675
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:33,679
that uh

1676
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:34,479
and

1677
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,439
also specifically putting it at a point

1678
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,560
where uh it comes in at a

1679
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,719
reasonable enough cost so that the

1680
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,759
community can really uh you know consume

1681
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,080
without having to literally break the

1682
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,000
bank like they used to have

1683
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,120
earlier

1684
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,000
so

1685
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,440
uh luambo actually like i said already

1686
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,760
now has a 4g

1687
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,719
tower

1688
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,280
run by amn it's africa mobile network

1689
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,199
they're they're a specialist tower

1690
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,560
company that does a lot of rural uh you

1691
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,600
know tower sites specifically tied up

1692
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,840
with larger telcos so that

1693
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
locations that the telcos themselves

1694
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,679
don't necessarily

1695
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,040
want to go and put in their own

1696
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,400
infrastructure

1697
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,800
amn does that and you know they work

1698
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,440
with the telcos

1699
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,120
luambo itself does not have a solid

1700
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,400
terrestrial

1701
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,199
bandwidth link so the remote site over

1702
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,159
there is working off a satellite backhoe

1703
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,880
which is by its very nature

1704
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,960
a constrained network

1705
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,199
so what we have done is we have really

1706
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,280
started putting together in parallel

1707
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,920
with all of these other activities a

1708
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,560
highly replicable stack

1709
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,679
of

1710
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,159
everything needed in order to be able to

1711
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,920
run a local tower like this uh starting

1712
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,040
all the way from the node b the

1713
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,480
epc

1714
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,719
the radios

1715
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,520
then we also bring in the ability to

1716
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,199
have a cdn and caching component in that

1717
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,640
infrastructure

1718
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,840
and in all of this we then uh enable

1719
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,480
various content partners to come in like

1720
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,679
we have someone like babu who is

1721
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,320
education content provider uh you know

1722
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,360
who builds content for the zambian

1723
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,280
curriculum

1724
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,400
we also don't want to only keep this as

1725
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,719
a very education focused

1726
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,880
initiative though education is a very

1727
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,520
large part of it we also wanted to be

1728
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,280
able to touch other parts and other

1729
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,840
members of the community so we have a

1730
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,320
commercial fm station

1731
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,400
coming in as one of our content partners

1732
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,120
and

1733
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,159
we are enabling them so that money fm

1734
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:53,440
which also carries a lot of financial

1735
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,560
education and financial empowerment

1736
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,520
content agricultural content

1737
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,440
that is something that we want the

1738
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,800
community to have the ability to consume

1739
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,880
we've also gone down the road of some

1740
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,719
religious content

1741
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,679
because uh you know faith life is one of

1742
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,120
the partners they're there they're

1743
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,840
basically providing us access to a tonga

1744
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,400
version of the bible okay which is

1745
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,040
something which is again not very easy

1746
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,520
to access in that community

1747
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,199
we're also working with virtual doctors

1748
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,320
so there's a health component of this

1749
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,040
and all of this is being basically

1750
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,000
brought together inside as compact a

1751
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,440
technical

1752
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,320
footprint as possible to keep the costs

1753
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,360
low

1754
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,560
and allow it to work even in a small

1755
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,360
community that doesn't necessarily have

1756
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,239
a large number of subscribers so when

1757
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,040
you can keep those costs low keep the

1758
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,760
technology uh you know

1759
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,880
simple enough so that uh telco does not

1760
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,520
have to worry too much about saying hey

1761
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,239
uh am i biting off more than i can chew

1762
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,440
by enabling such small

1763
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,719
remote sites that i as a telco i'm not

1764
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,040
normally geared up to be able to support

1765
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,440
and manage which is why

1766
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,600
we have not gone into that before

1767
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,080
by putting this in front of them we

1768
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,320
answer that question and say hey

1769
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,360
here's a tried and proven stack that's

1770
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,880
completely open that's available to you

1771
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,640
that allows you to

1772
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,880
continue to operate and serve these

1773
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,280
communities at a much higher level

1774
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,840
without necessarily having to do a lot

1775
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,080
of changes in your network architecture

1776
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,040
and all of that

1777
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,920
so

1778
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,400
like i said luambo is pretty small less

1779
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,280
than 4000 residents in all

1780
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,000
so we have been very selective in terms

1781
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,320
of selecting our first set of partners

1782
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,239
because we want this to be our template

1783
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,360
and a big deliverable of this pilot

1784
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,400
project

1785
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,360
one obviously is the report that shows

1786
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,400
how

1787
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,440
digital

1788
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,679
utilization of resources

1789
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,640
grows

1790
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,960
and how much of an impact each of these

1791
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,520
various interventions that we have done

1792
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,360
in that community

1793
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,719
results in a bump in the usage and this

1794
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,760
is something that we intend to run over

1795
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,000
a reasonably long period of time we have

1796
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,360
like almost a two year two plus year uh

1797
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,719
project uh verizon for collecting data

1798
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,880
and you know making sure that

1799
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,520
it's not just a short-term bump that we

1800
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,679
see because of it's just something novel

1801
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,840
and new that the community sees we want

1802
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,000
we want there to be a sustained

1803
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,480
improvement in digital literacy and

1804
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,320
digital engagement in that community

1805
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,960
in addition to what we are doing with

1806
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,520
the community themselves we have also

1807
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,679
like i said been working

1808
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,040
on the back end to make this entire

1809
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,320
text stack

1810
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,120
highly replicable so once we have this

1811
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,440
report and we have this uh example tech

1812
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,560
stack ready we can then literally go

1813
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,520
anywhere in the world any telco okay and

1814
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,719
say hey

1815
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,159
guys let's start using this template to

1816
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:21,360
start going into communities that you

1817
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,760
have been hesitant to start serving up

1818
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,239
until now

1819
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,920
uh so back to kevin i think you can take

1820
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,400
us through some more of the fine-grained

1821
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,600
details of exactly what we are doing in

1822
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,800
you know the schools in luambo

1823
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,960
sure and i'd just like to uh to add some

1824
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,640
information that that wasn't available

1825
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,679
at the time that we submitted our

1826
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,880
presentation we're actually starting to

1827
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,640
see some analytics come in even though

1828
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,600
this is

1829
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,440
early in implementation it's not even

1830
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,040
fully implemented yet there's certainly

1831
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,280
you know years worth of adoption work to

1832
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,000
be done but we've seen already a 25

1833
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,080
increase in usage in the community and

1834
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,920
almost all that's coming in that 4g

1835
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,679
space which was almost non-existent and

1836
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:02,960
this wouldn't have been possible without

1837
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,600
the n50 stack in place here and so we're

1838
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,320
seeing this happen is because the the

1839
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,840
applications are relevant to the

1840
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,679
community also not just as the service

1841
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:12,480
there

1842
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,280
but it's relevant in the schools and and

1843
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,520
they have now access to content and

1844
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,280
materials and online

1845
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,880
lessons and videos that they didn't have

1846
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,880
access to before

1847
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,239
same thing is true on the health care

1848
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,400
side where and this is especially true

1849
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,000
in a pandemic where

1850
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,400
where access was very

1851
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,120
distant not timely and not necessarily

1852
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
the right specialty or the right quality

1853
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,199
virtual doctors another n50 partner has

1854
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,600
been working here to help provide

1855
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,239
health care services remotely and that's

1856
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,640
you know made made it much easier and

1857
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,840
much more timely for them to get

1858
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:46,960
services

1859
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,960
this is something we expect to see um

1860
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,040
increasing as well as as the adoption

1861
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,519
proceeds

1862
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,440
and then on the next slide rajeev

1863
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,120
i want to talk a moment about how

1864
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
important it is to from the start have

1865
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,159
have sustainability plans in place it

1866
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,800
doesn't work if we just simply through

1867
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,400
philanthropy or even through a good

1868
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,679
model

1869
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,679
drop in equipment if it isn't something

1870
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,360
that can be sustained by the community

1871
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,280
we believe fully that that when it's

1872
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,120
relevant and adoption measures are in

1873
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,679
place that that itself helps to drive

1874
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,199
sustainability but the business models

1875
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,719
have to be there it has to be worthwhile

1876
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,600
for businesses to continue to invest in

1877
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,320
communities so that uh the market opens

1878
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,640
up and that healthy market is a great

1879
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,600
sign of sustainability so we we set out

1880
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
specific uh measurement indicators to

1881
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,760
let us know how we're doing in our work

1882
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,679
and how we're doing uh in in

1883
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,199
sustainability like i said these early

1884
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,199
analytics coming in from lumbo are very

1885
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,760
encouraging but it's not the goal right

1886
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,920
the goal is is much higher than just

1887
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,640
these initial these initial marks

1888
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,080
so um

1889
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,040
another hallmark of the m50 project is

1890
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,960
while we're committed to communities

1891
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,960
we're also committed to exit strategies

1892
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,400
right we don't we don't have an interest

1893
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,719
in 50 in being the provider for a long

1894
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,640
term we want to turn this over to the

1895
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,520
market and so we're looking for our way

1896
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,520
um out before we ever get in so that

1897
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,679
this is not a dependency situation at

1898
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,520
all truly the market develops and

1899
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,760
sustainability persists

1900
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,560
and and the persistence is towards

1901
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,640
the community defined goals what they've

1902
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,320
said is important to them

1903
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,239
um we don't come into it with any

1904
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,520
preconceived notions about what a

1905
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,960
community wants

1906
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,120
but we do find similar things coming up

1907
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,560
over and over again and they do center

1908
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,920
around education healthcare agriculture

1909
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,440
financial literacy

1910
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,280
and and sometimes it's cultural

1911
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,840
priorities even even

1912
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
in the u.s

1913
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,360
we find this with tribal nations their

1914
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,880
sovereignty their government services

1915
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,480
are hugely important

1916
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,520
so

1917
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,600
common themes but unique to each

1918
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,080
community

1919
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,040
and then next slide so we have released

1920
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,840
a white paper on this uh and i'll i'll i

1921
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,719
know that this uh presentation is

1922
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:01,520
not

1923
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,280
something you can click on so i'll pop

1924
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,960
it in the chat where you can see this

1925
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,920
white paper uh we're already seeing the

1926
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,600
the learning from this spread to other

1927
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,440
projects in africa and other places

1928
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,880
around the world where

1929
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,480
other organizations are saying hey what

1930
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,640
you did there will work here let's try

1931
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,400
it in a context of agriculture let's try

1932
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,320
it in a context in ghana or let's look

1933
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,800
at what's happening in zimbabwe and and

1934
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,440
see how this might um might extend so we

1935
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,640
encourage you to take a look at this and

1936
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,320
get more details than what we had just

1937
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,000
the time to to cover today

1938
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,480
and next slide regime

1939
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,840
i'll give you just a quick glimpse of

1940
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,520
where the infra infinity project is

1941
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,400
going

1942
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,880
um these are these are some dots of

1943
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,520
active and emerging projects um we're

1944
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,520
beginning to have presence all around

1945
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,760
the globe infinity project is relatively

1946
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,239
new formally launched in february so

1947
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,159
this is a six month old organization

1948
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,080
even though some of this pilot work

1949
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,480
we're talking about in in lumbo started

1950
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,800
almost a year before that the ecosystem

1951
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,280
of partners is is still kind of in full

1952
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,480
launch

1953
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,159
so you'll see more projects in these

1954
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,840
areas and then hopefully more recipes

1955
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,520
being adopted from these projects and

1956
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,239
other communities

1957
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,040
next slide review

1958
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,400
if you'd like to learn more this is how

1959
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,520
infinityproject.org is our website

1960
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,280
m50project.org

1961
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,440
join is how you sign up and i get i

1962
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,440
mentioned there's no there's no

1963
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,239
membership fees or annual dues and and

1964
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,760
that's not necessarily a sales pitch

1965
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,280
because there's nothing to sell but it

1966
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,880
is an indication of how we work it's a

1967
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
it's a coalition of the willing and we

1968
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,480
ask partners to bring a project or

1969
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,480
support a project that works in the ways

1970
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,080
that we've said are important to

1971
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,559
communities

1972
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,000
and i think hopefully now we have time

1973
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,239
for questions

1974
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,840
yes so looking forward to your questions

1975
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,239
everyone

1976
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,880
for your questions

1977
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,760
do we have any tickers

1978
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,280
you've done such a wonderful job of the

1979
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,120
presentation i don't see any errands for

1980
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:13,679
andrea leandro

1981
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,080
up with a question

1982
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,770
hi um

1983
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,000
[Music]

1984
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,960
i'm i'm impressed by by the

1985
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,360
how much you achieved in in so short

1986
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,960
time uh

1987
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,760
in the n50 project

1988
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,800
and yeah you already mentioned some some

1989
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
benefits some impact

1990
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,520
but uh given that you are

1991
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,080
intending to to replicate the model

1992
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,239
um

1993
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,880
you know i see technologies bring

1994
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,960
a lot of benefits obviously but there

1995
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,440
are also some risks and some imbalances

1996
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,800
in the communities

1997
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,560
um

1998
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,320
typically i mean technology it's like

1999
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,120
something magic for for for all of us

2000
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,520
and even more for the communities that

2001
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:04,080
are not used to uh technology and um

2002
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,679
and

2003
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,199
i was wondering about your your

2004
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,800
experience about

2005
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,600
how

2006
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,440
how this introduction

2007
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,600
uh i mean affects

2008
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,760
each community it affects for instance

2009
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,520
the structure of power

2010
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,199
the it

2011
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,639
it somehow

2012
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,480
helps to create um

2013
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,040
new jobs maybe in in

2014
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,000
in creating local content or in um

2015
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,600
in repairing maintaining the

2016
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,960
infrastructure

2017
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,360
uh in in

2018
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,560
bringing

2019
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,120
some um

2020
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,360
new opportunities like for instance

2021
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,400
electricity brings light and then

2022
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,760
there are some side effects as you

2023
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,920
mentioned also in health and everything

2024
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,000
um have you thought about doing some

2025
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,120
kind of

2026
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,960
formal let's say

2027
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,960
independent analysis of the impact to

2028
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,360
make sure that the model is um

2029
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,520
it's it's it's um

2030
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,159
it's as positive as possible or um

2031
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,320
and as polished as possible

2032
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,159
while you replicate the model

2033
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,920
that is such an insightful question

2034
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,000
thank you for that um

2035
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,800
i i come to this work lando from 25

2036
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,719
years working in k-12 education in the

2037
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,760
u.s so from before the internet to

2038
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,239
to times when now every student has

2039
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,560
access to a device said the computer

2040
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,880
and we've seen the good the bad the

2041
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
better the ugly all of it

2042
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,400
um

2043
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,560
it sort of begins with an understanding

2044
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,960
though that that by not having access

2045
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,960
while the world continues a pace with

2046
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,080
access

2047
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,840
these communities continue to be

2048
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,760
marginalized even more so

2049
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,760
so the reality is the technology is

2050
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,239
already impacting them in a negative way

2051
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,040
and the only thing that can help to to

2052
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,360
improve that is the technology

2053
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,159
uh so applied in the correct way so

2054
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,320
that's why we start with the community's

2055
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,639
um goals and aspirations first so that

2056
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,639
that's that ends up being the focus of

2057
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,199
the outcomes for the communities um but

2058
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,280
yes there are things to mitigate things

2059
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,920
to understand from the start to to make

2060
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,400
it the best of what it can be and the

2061
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,480
least of the bad that it can be

2062
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,560
um because technology in general will

2063
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,840
accelerate what you're already doing

2064
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,400
unless you purposefully make a shift in

2065
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
how it's applied this is something we've

2066
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,040
learned over and over so

2067
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,199
where some projects in the past may have

2068
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,800
have stopped at the delivery of the

2069
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,560
service or the delivery of the device

2070
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,920
per se

2071
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,600
without follow-on for digital literacy

2072
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,800
which includes digital citizenship uh it

2073
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,239
almost always

2074
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,560
ends poorly and and and worse for the

2075
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,840
community than if nothing were done at

2076
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,239
all so that's why the heavy focus for

2077
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,560
our side on the adoption side of this on

2078
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,080
applications that are relevant to the

2079
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,520
community so that that it begins with um

2080
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,800
the good for them

2081
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,840
uh

2082
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,239
i don't know i i like the question i'm

2083
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,760
not trying to dodge the question about

2084
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,159
the analysis i'm not sure how actually

2085
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,280
to um to approach that analysis except

2086
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,880
by looking at everything that we're

2087
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,840
doing and and publishing all the results

2088
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,440
uh that we find

2089
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,400
um

2090
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,560
and and sometimes we have to learn

2091
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,120
as we're going what is and isn't working

2092
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,719
there um

2093
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,960
but uh i think i think the best we can

2094
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,320
do at the moment is focusing on the

2095
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,400
positive outcomes that we can get and

2096
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,920
knowing that that

2097
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,440
um unmitigated it goes poorly

2098
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,520
um and leandro if i'd like to kind of

2099
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,080
chip in um one of the very important

2100
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,000
decisions that we made um you know like

2101
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,440
i said very early on in the project was

2102
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,760
to get our community liaison our

2103
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,800
community manager in place and talking

2104
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,679
to the community long before we had even

2105
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,080
started any of the technical work or the

2106
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,960
measurement work because um we know that

2107
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,239
unless the community feels involved and

2108
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,560
a part of the process and not just the

2109
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,560
part of the execution but a part of the

2110
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,120
planning end of the process um there's

2111
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,480
never really going to be as much of a

2112
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,199
buy-in into the potential of what the

2113
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,679
project can deliver um you know then if

2114
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:08,000
someone literally kind of helicopters in

2115
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,639
drops a bunch of devices and some

2116
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,560
tech in there and then just expects the

2117
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,239
community to figure stuff out on their

2118
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,560
own right so it was it was very

2119
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,440
important for us uh which is why

2120
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,320
long before we got the first device or

2121
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,280
the first piece of tech in there we had

2122
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,080
a community manager we had multiple

2123
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,159
meetings with the community

2124
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,480
understanding what they wanted um

2125
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,719
understanding how to do something safely

2126
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,360
because um it it may be as simple as

2127
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,360
deciding okay you're

2128
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,719
you're not going to carpet bomb the

2129
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,120
entire community with 4 000 devices we

2130
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,520
don't have the resources to do that

2131
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,719
you're going to send a few hundred

2132
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,199
devices into this into that community

2133
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,040
how do you send them in safely so that

2134
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,920
you don't have to worry about negative

2135
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,480
effects in that community uh it may be

2136
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,080
something as simple as saying hey my

2137
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,920
neighbor received a

2138
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,560
phone for free and i didn't

2139
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,719
i'm jealous and you know that leads to a

2140
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,040
social uh you know

2141
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,120
angle of all of this so

2142
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,520
you know we had to do a lot of this uh

2143
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,920
planning and um you know like for

2144
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,600
example one of the interesting things

2145
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,320
that we are doing in this community is

2146
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,120
uh when we're sending devices out into

2147
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,320
the community they go with a

2148
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,520
agreement

2149
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,760
that someone who's receiving the device

2150
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,239
agrees to do certain things to start

2151
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,880
learning certain skills okay using those

2152
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,679
devices as an enabler so people don't

2153
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,120
feel that hey he's just getting

2154
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,280
something for free he's he's committing

2155
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,000
to participate in the project and that

2156
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,400
participation is what we really want to

2157
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,520
highlight

2158
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,560
as a part of our you know analysis and

2159
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,600
our report and hopefully that

2160
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,920
we hope that the results that come out

2161
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,239
of this entire exercise will really

2162
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,639
encourage others to follow this similar

2163
01:27:58,639 --> 01:27:59,520
kind of

2164
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,679
highly participative model when they're

2165
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,280
trying to do for future projects

2166
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,159
yes thank you man very good answer um

2167
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,480
i mean in in the research community

2168
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,960
there is the uh there is a

2169
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,880
there are conferences and and groups

2170
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,000
that work on uh ict for development they

2171
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
have experience in evaluating projects

2172
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,920
and um and what you mentioned is it's

2173
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,400
really important i feel like me

2174
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,199
and i can see one one comment from alien

2175
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,239
father that um in the chat maybe you can

2176
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,360
read it and

2177
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,320
i am

2178
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,480
going through that at the moment

2179
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,760
yeah i had a chance to look at that

2180
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,840
while while you were responding

2181
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,880
um

2182
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,600
um rajiv let's let's uh tag team this a

2183
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,880
little bit um i would start with um

2184
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,040
the point that's made in it that we

2185
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,800
we may have come across as providing

2186
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,639
this only to leaders technical teachers

2187
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,560
and clinicians and so forth and i would

2188
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,639
just say the opposite is true adrian i

2189
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:55,600
hope that this is something you can

2190
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,280
catch on the audio later

2191
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,719
it's very much about getting to the

2192
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,400
individuals

2193
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,120
and and

2194
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,639
and and sometimes we have to actually

2195
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:05,520
sort of

2196
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,199
work with communities through that

2197
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,840
because sometimes their go-to is to give

2198
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,920
it to the leaders and we generally

2199
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,000
insist more on on making sure that it

2200
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,920
gets to the students to the families to

2201
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,600
the mothers to the children

2202
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,320
and the communities

2203
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,120
yeah i agree with you uh i've seen in in

2204
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,080
previous like um

2205
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,920
projects or research publications that

2206
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,080
they talk about the sense of ownership

2207
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,760
or the appropriation

2208
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,159
that um and the difficulty to talk to

2209
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:37,460
everyone

2210
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,719
[Music]

2211
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:39,600
in

2212
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,000
in the community without amplifying the

2213
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,679
unbalances the imbalances that are

2214
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,760
already there like for instance talking

2215
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,280
to the leaders means talking to people

2216
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,199
to to men not to women

2217
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:49,920
or

2218
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,960
talking to

2219
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,000
someone

2220
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,880
you are bring giving them uh

2221
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,000
some power

2222
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,400
and and sharing this power between you

2223
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,800
and the community is tricky uh

2224
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
especially because you might be there

2225
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,880
for for very long time but they are

2226
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,600
going to be there forever and then

2227
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,320
as long as they see that as a critical

2228
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,040
resource that they manage and they

2229
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,159
decide

2230
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:17,920
or co-decide then this is going to last

2231
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,600
more or less or

2232
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,120
help the community

2233
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,880
everyone in the community or not not

2234
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,120
some of them but yeah i mean this is

2235
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,280
intrinsically difficult uh

2236
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,480
challenge and

2237
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,880
and i was really happy to hear your

2238
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,960
approach i don't know if there are other

2239
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,800
comments in the in the room

2240
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,960
i see jane go ahead

2241
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,760
sorry it takes a bit of time with the

2242
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,199
audio um

2243
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,600
thank you for the presentation um

2244
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,800
and i would just like to

2245
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,840
add a at a voice to your and support to

2246
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,000
the community-based approach uh those

2247
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,920
that know me know that that's

2248
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,320
something i believe in very strongly

2249
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,000
i've been doing some work

2250
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,600
not internationally which was something

2251
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,440
i've been doing for 25 years but doing

2252
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,199
some more domestic work in the united

2253
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,800
states recently

2254
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,320
um

2255
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,800
and i'm

2256
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,199
when i think you go into um

2257
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,880
a community

2258
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,840
people often as you say can parachute in

2259
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,360
right and i've seen that when i worked

2260
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,080
in in other communities overseas

2261
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,239
and the parachute in approach just

2262
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,840
doesn't work it doesn't bring that

2263
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,239
sustainability around i really liked

2264
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,760
your point um

2265
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,440
about working with the community across

2266
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,800
the community

2267
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,520
um we've been i work for a different

2268
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,280
organization now but we're finding that

2269
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,120
when you i used to work at the internet

2270
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,040
society but we're finding that when

2271
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,560
you're looking at doing planning grants

2272
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,320
for getting money to do

2273
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,920
build out for community networks for

2274
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,440
small networks

2275
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,040
that bringing in a variety of different

2276
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,800
actors across that community is critical

2277
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,040
from the very beginning

2278
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,400
you don't want a single point of failure

2279
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,600
in your network you don't want single

2280
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,600
points of failure in your community

2281
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,080
approach either and so i i just wanted

2282
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,480
to thank you for the presentation and

2283
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,560
very interesting and as adrien said i'll

2284
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,560
i too i'm going to take a stronger look

2285
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,840
at what you've been doing because i

2286
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,000
think there's a there's a great approach

2287
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,320
here that can be integrated

2288
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,080
we're looking at doing some community

2289
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,639
readiness approaches and i just wondered

2290
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,960
have you found a good way to do a quick

2291
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,280
assessment of where communities might be

2292
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,280
with respect to the different

2293
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,639
learning tracks that you want to bring

2294
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:31,440
in

2295
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,880
because we're finding that we need to

2296
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,040
come in at a parallel approach now

2297
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,760
versus just a single tract approach with

2298
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,960
sort of a

2299
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
linear value chain of effort we're

2300
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,159
thinking that we need to come in with

2301
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,520
various different um tracks of learning

2302
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,080
um almost simultaneously but i would

2303
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,600
love to hear your thoughts on sort of a

2304
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,239
readiness approach

2305
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,840
gina thank you for your your comments

2306
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,600
and your questions um

2307
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,239
for multiple reasons um

2308
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,040
so

2309
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,199
thinking about you know how

2310
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,120
some organizations intentionally or

2311
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,639
unintentionally parachute in and

2312
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,080
parachute out of communities and how

2313
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,280
that doesn't work

2314
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,800
we've specifically taken the opposite

2315
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,120
approach as i think you've noticed

2316
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,719
i think this is most apparent when we

2317
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,880
were working with

2318
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,560
tribal communities in the united states

2319
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,639
where

2320
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,639
simply gaining access to the to the

2321
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,560
communities challenge right it's very

2322
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,000
it's very insular

2323
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,120
and and proudly sovereign um and one of

2324
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,760
the first looks you get is who are you

2325
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,159
and how long will you be here and and

2326
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,920
very little happens until you prove that

2327
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,159
you will you will stay and be committed

2328
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,639
so having been now involved over over

2329
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,639
years with the same communities helping

2330
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,719
them to identify grant opportunities

2331
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,159
build business strategies do

2332
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,080
implementation do adoption do

2333
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,440
sustainability

2334
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,120
um has has been has been a trust

2335
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,440
building you know operation that that

2336
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,880
allows us to then

2337
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,960
bring like-minded organizations to them

2338
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,480
to help further

2339
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,800
um and then in terms of

2340
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,400
project curation

2341
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,440
i think i would love to come back and do

2342
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,560
a whole other session on project

2343
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,840
curation because we have some wonderful

2344
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,679
materials we've developed in partnership

2345
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:08,400
with

2346
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,000
with our our team to um

2347
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,600
to do that curation of community

2348
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,440
readiness partner readiness impact

2349
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,800
measurement and so forth there's

2350
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,800
actually a starter kit on our website

2351
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,480
that's available to anybody

2352
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,480
if there's interest in that but we could

2353
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,679
we could do another session and talk

2354
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,400
about how we how we bring projects in

2355
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,719
into the fold

2356
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,639
thank you that would be very um we could

2357
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,400
definitely consider that

2358
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,920
um i should stop talking and see if

2359
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,760
there's anyone else that has um a

2360
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,000
question or an observation i think you

2361
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
just want to validate leandro and

2362
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,360
courtesy don't think we have the other

2363
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,080
presentations from the prospective folks

2364
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,679
that we're gonna also speak so we may

2365
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,119
have more time to just have um a q a

2366
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,040
with all of the participants who are

2367
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,719
here

2368
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,600
am i right about that leandro

2369
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,320
yes

2370
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:06,000
um we haven't got slides uh or

2371
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,080
the login so so we don't we cannot

2372
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,800
expect more presentations today but yes

2373
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,480
as you said i think there's a nice

2374
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,000
opportunity to to to talk about

2375
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,840
how the the

2376
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,760
the three presentations we had how they

2377
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,080
could combine with each other maybe we

2378
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,400
can ask the other presenters to

2379
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,639
reflect on what they

2380
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,760
what they saw here today and then how

2381
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,119
their um

2382
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,560
approach

2383
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,000
could combine or is different uh similar

2384
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,159
from the others and and start discussion

2385
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:42,320
about about the whole the whole um the

2386
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,199
three ways of uh of of addressing a

2387
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,839
common problem

2388
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,560
uh yandere i'd like to also bring up one

2389
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,800
point uh you know that i thought would

2390
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,320
be interesting for us to also explore

2391
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,040
that is the possibility of you know

2392
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,719
identifying now

2393
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,239
entirely aside from the project and uh

2394
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,840
you know the community and everything

2395
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,239
are purely on the technical side okay

2396
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,679
some of the challenges that you're

2397
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:15,199
overcoming um in these environments uh

2398
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,440
you know at a technical level both in

2399
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,679
terms of integration with delco networks

2400
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,760
as well as uh you know

2401
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,400
you know deep education for content to

2402
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,320
make it more readily available to

2403
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,679
communities

2404
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,920
in such challenging environments

2405
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,719
some of those technical solutions that

2406
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:35,199
come out of our project and all of the

2407
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,440
other projects that you know we've been

2408
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,560
looking at

2409
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,679
during this meeting uh might also be a

2410
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,880
good foundation to you know think of in

2411
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,840
terms of some technical standards um or

2412
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,159
at least technical best practices

2413
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,679
guidelines

2414
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,639
work that can eventually turn into

2415
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,400
an rfc

2416
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,560
at the ietf so you know basically become

2417
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,960
a good template that can help people

2418
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,679
really put together community networks

2419
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:08,880
and

2420
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,119
if you could you know help connect us

2421
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:14,320
with wherever in the ietf work is

2422
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,920
happening around defining those

2423
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,880
community networking rfcs

2424
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
you know we'd really love to see what we

2425
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,719
can do there in terms of contribution

2426
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,840
good point so let's let's see i mean

2427
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,280
what the others

2428
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,199
say about

2429
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,320
these two ideas and and how we can

2430
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,159
elaborate on the on the

2431
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,560
collective um

2432
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,320
effort on our collective set of

2433
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,519
presentations today

2434
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,960
for instance uh you mentioned uh in the

2435
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,719
first presentation there was mention of

2436
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,440
satellite based community networks

2437
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,840
i don't know for instance um your or

2438
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,560
your own experience about that or

2439
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,719
or the case of of

2440
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,280
philippines also there was some

2441
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,119
part in satellite

2442
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,520
as as you said rajiv

2443
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,040
there are many

2444
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,360
uh technical solutions out there

2445
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,719
um

2446
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,520
and uh well i have to say that rfcs are

2447
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,840
not the best uh marketing tool

2448
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,280
but um

2449
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,000
but um yeah so so i i'm basically

2450
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
thinking of them beyond

2451
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,560
a marketing tool but um like like we

2452
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,840
said at the n50 we were very uh you know

2453
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,920
focused on building recipes that are

2454
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,760
reusable we want to build solutions both

2455
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,760
in terms of process as well as in terms

2456
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,960
of technology that basically make uh

2457
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,400
projects like this

2458
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,360
a much lower risk and much faster

2459
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,719
implementation

2460
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,880
to the community over time because

2461
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,600
that's i believe the only way we'll

2462
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,920
make a dent on

2463
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,440
the problem

2464
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,719
the scale of the problem as we see it

2465
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,880
yeah i mentioned the term marketing that

2466
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,440
not in terms of selling products but

2467
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,159
about selling ideas is that usually rfcs

2468
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,119
work

2469
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,000
across the technical community but they

2470
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
are not really designed to be uh

2471
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,239
let's say a great or understood by

2472
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,480
people outside our technical community

2473
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,960
but yeah it's an instrument uh

2474
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,119
several years ago in gaia we developed

2475
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,800
one rfc

2476
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,960
reporting about the technological

2477
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,880
options at that time and discussing

2478
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,360
about it and i think it was helpful to

2479
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,679
realize what the differences and the

2480
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,840
commonalities

2481
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,520
but at the same time when you think

2482
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,600
about community networks

2483
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,480
um

2484
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,760
it's difficult to come up with a

2485
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,159
specific um

2486
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,000
challenging problems that the technical

2487
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,320
community can solve

2488
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,719
globally but there are solutions and the

2489
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,480
solutions are more or less

2490
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,840
adapted to to uh to community networking

2491
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,719
environments you can see in the idf some

2492
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,639
work about um

2493
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,080
like uh low rate connections or routing

2494
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,280
or uh

2495
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,920
or energy related um

2496
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,480
so so yeah i mean uh collecting this

2497
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,800
information as you said would reduce the

2498
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,840
the risk

2499
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,560
in

2500
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,480
and and put um

2501
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,199
facilitate new initiatives to

2502
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,000
at least be aware of the experiences and

2503
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,520
learn from the mistakes learn from the

2504
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,480
successes and i yeah it would be nice to

2505
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,239
somehow be able to summarize the

2506
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,400
technical lessons but also the other

2507
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,520
lessons and governance lessons and and

2508
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,080
economic lessons from other initiatives

2509
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,840
in a compact manner so it would be

2510
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,600
reusable

2511
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,199
and as an organizational memory

2512
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:50,880
for other initiatives

2513
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,960
any other comments about this around

2514
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,280
this

2515
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,360
my only comment leandro would be to

2516
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,199
reinforce

2517
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,880
the collaborative nature of the m50

2518
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,800
project we believe better together and

2519
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,639
we don't see anything but compatibility

2520
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,800
with everything else we saw today

2521
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,480
different communities need different

2522
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,920
technical solutions they need different

2523
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,000
adoption solutions and then the more we

2524
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,199
have

2525
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,960
at the ready the better we can serve our

2526
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,679
communities

2527
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,119
yeah

2528
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,440
and by the way i just taken a couple of

2529
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,280
minutes uh

2530
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,760
for you to know um the itf has too many

2531
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,920
parallel meetings and and working

2532
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,360
meetings uh

2533
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,760
just from my agenda tomorrow

2534
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,000
at the same time as today there is one

2535
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,040
another research group it's called icn

2536
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,520
inc information centric networking there

2537
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,159
is a technical group that focuses on on

2538
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,600
on

2539
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,000
on information-centric networks that was

2540
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,840
oriented to content

2541
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,520
also at the seventh well in my 7 30 so

2542
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,480
uh

2543
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,920
in in two hours from now uh tomorrow or

2544
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,239
one and a half hours from now is the

2545
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,440
hrpc the human rights

2546
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,640
in protocols

2547
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,840
[Music]

2548
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,000
working group and also

2549
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,960
later on is the decentralized

2550
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,560
internet research group that also um

2551
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,400
touches topics which are connected to

2552
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,679
this

2553
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,280
i don't know if anyone in the audience

2554
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,520
wants to comment about any of these

2555
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,280
upcoming meetings no

2556
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,400
kevin um it might make sense if you want

2557
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,960
to talk a little bit about some of what

2558
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,520
the n50 is doing in ukraine right now

2559
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,000
because that is of probably also tying

2560
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,719
in to some of these uh you know topics

2561
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,440
that leandro just talked about

2562
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,639
um i'm sure i'd be happy to um and and

2563
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,080
the work we're doing in and around

2564
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,480
ukraine is sort of the other end of the

2565
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,880
spectrum if you will to to have a pun on

2566
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:49,600
that

2567
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,119
uh where it's a completely different

2568
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:54,159
solution that we're working on there so

2569
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,440
um

2570
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,520
folks who are displaced or leaving

2571
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,400
ukraine are in the millions

2572
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,520
and uh they're highly mobile but they

2573
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,400
they are also edge um

2574
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,199
uh

2575
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:09,040
and marginalized people

2576
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,920
so we set out at the at the

2577
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,639
at the start of the conflict to deploy

2578
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,760
what we call pccs which which is um

2579
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,920
portable connectivity centers and these

2580
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,520
are shipping containers that are

2581
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,360
purpose-built to

2582
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,360
have network gear included them you can

2583
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,280
put them anywhere they have solar panels

2584
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,360
and diesel generators you can connect

2585
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:32,080
them to anything from satellite to

2586
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,800
to a local m o to ethernet to fiber

2587
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,840
and then they can be moved and

2588
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,679
reconnected as the situation changes on

2589
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:38,719
the ground

2590
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,639
so um knowing that these were coming

2591
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,800
into um

2592
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,400
that type of context knowing that we

2593
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,239
were still in a pandemic these are

2594
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,920
essentially not internal shelters

2595
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,320
they're external radiation

2596
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,560
areas where where the the service is

2597
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,639
provided around the containers and the

2598
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,480
equipment is kept inside we have

2599
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,920
multiple partners participating in this

2600
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,239
almost none of them put their logos on

2601
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,280
it it's strictly a a a

2602
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,880
a philanthropic effort those substantial

2603
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,040
resources were committed to it

2604
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,800
to provide computers to provide the

2605
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,360
network connectivity as we go around to

2606
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,719
provide

2607
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:16,320
the on-site staffing we're working with

2608
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,400
world vision to deploy 10 of these

2609
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,119
containers right now

2610
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,119
some four weeks

2611
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,280
after the first ideation occurred we had

2612
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,199
the first container in place in

2613
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,760
bucharest romania to support refugees

2614
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,600
now what we're finding is that the the

2615
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,840
demand is increasing for these

2616
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,719
these uh containers pretty substantially

2617
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,400
where we can provide government services

2618
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,679
where we can provide health care where

2619
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,679
continuing education can occur where way

2620
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,000
finding services can occur just where am

2621
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,760
i and how do i get to get to the next

2622
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,199
place on my journey

2623
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,360
and so we're working with

2624
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,760
various ministries in ukraine and around

2625
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,920
ukraine to um

2626
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,920
to make these

2627
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,080
a semi-sustainable solution

2628
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,560
uh until more permanent

2629
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,560
resolution occurs to the to the conflict

2630
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,440
there

2631
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,719
so um that's that's that's the other

2632
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,119
type of thing that we do uh

2633
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,639
i could go through ten other type of

2634
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:11,760
projects and tell you how they're all

2635
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,440
different but you start to see

2636
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,560
um how

2637
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,520
how the

2638
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,440
weight of these different organizations

2639
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,800
can be brought to bear on almost any

2640
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:19,840
challenge

2641
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,520
and and rather quickly when they work

2642
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,920
together

2643
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,840
yeah well what you mentioned for us is

2644
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,080
connected to the this

2645
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,080
computer aid project on solar learning

2646
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,040
labs

2647
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,199
and

2648
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,920
that that we are in touch um since seven

2649
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,760
years ago we we are actually we have

2650
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,320
some students now in in south africa

2651
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,440
these days uh preparing for for this one

2652
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,199
solar learning lab in

2653
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:47,840
in a place uh in the community there

2654
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,000
and i also shared a link of this

2655
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,480
community network exchange that

2656
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,600
is happening these days in india

2657
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,440
as well so

2658
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,360
it's really comforting to see so many so

2659
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,960
many activities around

2660
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,960
so i think we are getting

2661
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,360
close to the end of the session i wonder

2662
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,560
if um

2663
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,440
if cortes or jane want to

2664
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,520
comment anything else and close closed

2665
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,840
session

2666
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,719
sure

2667
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,800
first thanking all the presenters these

2668
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,560
were fantastic good discussions and so

2669
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,719
much synergy between them

2670
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,320
hopefully you all can chat with each

2671
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,600
other

2672
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,960
and i'll be sending some reach out

2673
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,880
emails for our own work which i think

2674
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,080
similarly dovetails well uh i want to

2675
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,760
also call out the note takers

2676
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,119
i think

2677
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:38,840
of particular

2678
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,840
uh value was was nick who seems to have

2679
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,440
done a bunch of writing so thank you so

2680
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,600
much uh for that but of course there are

2681
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,840
other folks as well so anyone who jumped

2682
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,440
in and provided a little bit more

2683
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,040
context for the folks

2684
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,040
who aren't going to be

2685
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,360
or who couldn't be here uh live in this

2686
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,920
hybrid world we live in uh great thanks

2687
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,560
for that um and lastly is probably just

2688
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,239
to call it for any other talks people

2689
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:03,760
want to give i think

2690
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,440
this is a great venue for people to

2691
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,040
share their work

2692
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,280
and to get more feedback from outside of

2693
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,679
whatever bubble we all individually live

2694
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,760
in um it was great to see some of the

2695
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,159
different ecosystems that play here uh

2696
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:17,440
and and different countries and

2697
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,600
different perspectives on connectivity

2698
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,840
uh so um do you have anything else you'd

2699
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,000
like to add

2700
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:37,760
seeing jane pop up and not hearing

2701
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,080
anything

2702
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,360
showing no kilobits a second which might

2703
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,880
be a problem i'll assume jane doesn't

2704
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,400
have much to add

2705
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,360
um

2706
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,679
okay now it's coming through it's funny

2707
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,760
it took a good 30 seconds but um no just

2708
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,920
to thank everybody to echo

2709
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,239
what curtis and leandro have both said

2710
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:57,440
and to thank everyone for their

2711
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,920
presentations and

2712
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,080
to just echo curtis's invitation for

2713
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,600
more

2714
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,840
data presentations collaboration and

2715

2716
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:10,719
to join the guy list if you haven't

2717
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,199
and uh we welcome lots of dialogue on

2718
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,440
that list it's been a little quiet over

2719
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,960
the last couple months but we'll

2720
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,480
reinvigorate that

2721
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,159
and just to sort of put something on the

2722
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,000
clipboard that came up during the

2723
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,600
conversation is this discussion about

2724
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,760
what community networks are and i think

2725
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,360
peng had a good point about

2726
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,119
satellite-related integration of

2727
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,400
networks with

2728
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,199
you know

2729
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,360
based other and i think it would be

2730
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,080
great for us to explore what um the rfc

2731
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,239
that we've already got in place but to

2732
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,320
maybe elaborate on that or

2733
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,000
hack a new one together

2734
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
so otherwise um thanks everybody for

2735
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,440
