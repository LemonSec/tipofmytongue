26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
how the technology is working and how

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,000
the sessions are going to work and so

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520

remind you of the note well this is

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,320
probably the first time you've seen it

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
this week so it's a reminder of the ietf

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,720
policies that govern your participation

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,840
and please make sure that you've read

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,799
all of these you would have said at

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
registration that you would do so in

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
particular take note of all the kind of

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,119
patent policies and general code of

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,040
conduct and anti-harassment procedures

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
as well as the way the ietf works if you

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,759
have any issues contact the ombudsman

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
team

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
and just to say that these are places

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
for professional collaboration and

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
networking there are some um extensive

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
documentations that talk about the way

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
that you should be behaving at these

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,520
meetings and if you have any concerns at

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
all once again please talk to the

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,199
ombudsman team it's important that we uh

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
create a good environment so everyone

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,319
can bring their best work and bring

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
their best selves to these kind of

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
technical discussions that we're having

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,480
um so please reach out um to the

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
ombudsman team or anyone around you that

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,239
you trust if you experience any

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,959
difficulties or offensive behavior

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,239
so hybrid meeting participation and i

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,760
think we're all still getting used to it

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,519
perhaps you're well seasoned by now but

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
if not please bear with just while we

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
run through this because it is the first

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
session of the week so a lot of stuff um

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
might seem new or has changed since last

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
time so to the folks in the room and

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,959
please make sure that you've signed into

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
the session using the meet echo light

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,040
client there's a nice circle there to

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
show you exactly the button to join it's

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
really important to join that because

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
that um creates the blue sheets but also

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
it's how i'm going to call the queue so

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
if you stand in the room at the mic but

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,200
you have not joined the queue on the

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
meet echo light client then i will not

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
be calling you in to the queue so do

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,879
make sure that you have joined the mike

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,159
mq on meet echo we're asking you to keep

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
your audio and video off if you're a

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
fully remote participant or if you're on

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
the on-site version as well and please

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
use a headset

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
so i can see that we've um got someone

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
stood up at the mic but possibly not

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
joined on the meat echo client so

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
i'm about to break my own rule just as

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
an exception what's up

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
testing testing okay

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
what's the user user

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
um so i i actually can't join the meet

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
echo it's not joining it just gives you

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
an error when you try and join or log in

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,720
and says not authorized and several

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
people are having this problem so how

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
would you like to proceed

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
okay i can see mira is just joined to

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,959
the queue mira do you have a response

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
for that

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
i think she's just testing

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,560
i was just testing so colin if you want

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
to join just i can click for you i don't

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
know

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
okay well this is exactly why we have

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
murray at the back up in the room

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
so perhaps yeah in this thing

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
if it's helpful if someone comes up to

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,759
the mic because they can't join i'll

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,520
type it in the jabber and you can

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
manually manage it super yeah let's

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
manage it that way for now um so we'll

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,440
hopefully those issues will be resolved

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
by the end of the week but uh i can see

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
everyone joining the queue now yep um

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,759
leave the queue

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,560
okay thanks so um i think it's if it

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
works for you then that would be the

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
ideal way to join the queue if not um

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
like we said just in person in the

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
meeting and we'll manage it by murray

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
and this is why we have our resilience

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,639
strategies

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,280
it should be resolved soon so anyway try

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,039

just to run through the agenda and take

169
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
any agenda bash comments so you can see

170
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
that we've got a bit of flex time today

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
and but we have five presentations

172
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
flashing between either 20 minutes or 10

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
minutes for various items

174
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,919
um

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
and then we have the art area session

176
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,319
going on after that which is why murray

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,160
is at the front and has to say that this

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
whole session sorry murray just for the

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
kind of appendage bit to give updates

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
from the arts area

181
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
so we just paused here so there's any

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
agenda bashing keeping a beady eye on

183
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,479
the queue

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,719
in the room and on the techo

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,919
jonathan rosenberg

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,880
hello uh jonathan rosenberg five nine

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
uh it's not on the agenda and i don't

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
think we'll have time but i submitted a

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
draft called spin there's been a lot of

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
discussion on the list

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
if we don't get to it here i do want to

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
let people know there's a mimi buff

193
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,960
today

194
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,639
that's one of the

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,080
side meetings

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
so we'll try and do some discussion

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
there and i do ask if there's any time

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,039
at the end

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
left over anyone interested like to

200
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
discuss this topic thank you it's we do

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,560
mention it during the upcoming meeting

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
stuff

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
great thank you jonathan okay any other

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
comments before we dive right in

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
um first on

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
the presentation slides it's binary

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
application record encoding from jury

208
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,960
and we have got in the notes and the

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
links to the slides links to existing

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
messages and discussions

211
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
otherwise we'll just invite him to

212
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,840
come up and present

213
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
hello so it's up to me i think hi yeah

214
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,199
jerry would you like me to drive the

215
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,560
slides for you or would you like to do

216
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,520
them yourself

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,080
if you can i don't know how to do that

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
in each system so i'm sorry

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
okay no that's okay that's all

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,759
give me a second

221
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah so uh hello everyone uh my name is

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
siri lasak and i will present binary

223
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,120
application record encoding or

224
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
shortcut

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,838
please next

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,680
so the first what is bare it's a

227
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
message encoding this is binary it

228
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
scores

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
data into the binary uh that are then

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
used to

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,360
store these data on or transmit these

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
data the original author is through the

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
valve

234
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,519
the main contributor of the updates is

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
victorian erwinger and i

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
do

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
connect all these uh awesome

238
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
contributions into uh together and uh

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
now presenting and trying to

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,519
standardize this uh this protocol

241
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,560
yes next please

242
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,959
so uh

243
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,080
what are the goals of parents

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,760
well first concise messages

245
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
then

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,040
the schema this is well defined and

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
and so the broad compatibility

248
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
programming environments well i guess

249
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
that all the encodings

250
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
are trying to do this

251
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
and the

252
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
important thing is the simplicity of

253
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
implementation

254
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,800
next please

255
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,320
so

256
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
the use cases for bare where

257
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
well

258
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
in the internet of uh services or

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
internet of things or these applications

260
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
the communications

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
the communication is really important so

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
you need some protocol to communicate

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
these

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,839
these messages there are plenty of these

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
communications

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,399
encodings and so on

267
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,920
the bare

268
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,200
as

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
we saw in the goals has concise messages

270
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
simply uh simplicity of implementation

271
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
and is used to communicate between these

272
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
web services or communicate

273
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,120
between the the internet of things

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
devices or

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,279
to store some uh some tokens uh into the

276
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,600
into file systems and

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
and uh so on so this is some use cases

278
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
of

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
of the bare

280
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
uh encoding

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
please next

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
yes well so this was in short

283
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,200
introduction what is bare

284
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
and

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
how it can be used

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
and now uh i would like to present some

287
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
some feedback

288
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
in the dispatch mailing list up to today

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,519
i haven't read the the feedback that was

290
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
sent today so i'm sorry about that

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
and the first uh

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
was

293
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,399
the comparison into cb or r

294
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,640
o r uh concise binary object

295
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
representation well

296
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
regarding this question i would like to

297
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,640
say that the cbor uh is based on json

298
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
which is itself the text based

299
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
uh and

300
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,160
the

301
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,519
main difference between cbor and bara in

302
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,680
my opinion is that cbo r contains the

303
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
schema because it has the legacy of json

304
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,639
format

305
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
and try trying to be compatible or json

306
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
in binary world

307
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,920
then these are kind of

308
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
different in this specific

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
things this is the main difference i

310
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
would say

311
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
the uh

312
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
there are

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
more differences but this one is the

314
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,240
domain i think

315
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
so please next

316
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
uh yeah there was another feedback about

317
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
the schema language i

318
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
don't think that i understand it

319
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
correctly and there were no replies

320
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
and replies to to

321
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,279
explain that so maybe this would be to

322
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
the discussion

323
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
please next

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
yeah well one of the feedbacks was the

325
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,800
request for measurements

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,160
between cbor

327
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
well i

328
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,000
did performed

329
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,279
some

330
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,320
tests

331
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,040
with the scripts that is available on

332
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
the on the link the slides

333
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,959
in fact it was a

334
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,200
kind of uh

335
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
kind of data structures that were 1000

336
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
messages

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
in one list that

338
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
showed or

339
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,399
that was corresponding

340
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
orders in

341
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,720
some

342
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,440
uh

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,399
some

344
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,600
imagina

345
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
imagined uh

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,839
shop or eshop

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
and uh just to come

348
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
to have some base measurement i used

349
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
json

350
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
as a un uh compressed and text based

351
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,399
format

352
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,440
then i

353
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,639
encapsulated or

354
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
encoded the the

355
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
whole list of messages in

356
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
using cbor and then

357
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
encoded using bare

358
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
and

359
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
the next measurement was the the same

360
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
but zipped

361
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,519
or

362
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
compressed form if

363
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
we can see the results in the bottom of

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
the slide

365
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
when we use

366
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,719
the the

367
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,920
length of the complete messages

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,279
is

369
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,079
comparable to the to the

370
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,839
row uh

371
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
raw data

372
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,800
when we use cbor there is some overhead

373
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
which comes

374
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
with cbor because

375
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,399
cbr messages contains the schema

376
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,959
of the messages and when we use json

377
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,000
there is even a greater overhead the

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
same apply for the for the compressed

379
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,518
versions

380
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
so it's like that

381
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
next please

382
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
um yeah just to say that paul hoffman

383
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
has joined the queue i don't know if you

384
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,199
want to take questions now or at the end

385
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
yeah and definitely

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
okay paul would you like to ask a

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
question

388
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,920
this is paul hoffman co-author of seabor

389
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,720
um

390
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
i think your previous slide in this

391
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
slide have a pretty significant error a

392
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
seaboard doesn't have a built-in schema

393
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
you can build one in if you want that

394
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
would be complete waste of overhead here

395
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,399
i

396
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
looking at your example here i cannot

397
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
imagine how it would be twice as big

398
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,639
unless you tagged

399
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,880
every item saying this is the name this

400
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
is this which is

401
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
pretty much

402
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
not what anyone does in seaboard so um

403
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
again seaboard was not written to be

404
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
shortest it's written to be concise

405
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,399
that's very different

406
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
but i think your comparisons are pretty

407
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
off uh because you're trying to force

408
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
the schema into seaborg which is

409
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,000
doable but not necessary thank you

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
yeah great uh thank you very much i am

411
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
really sorry about that i will uh

412
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,720
redo the experiment and update the

413
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,199
threat email thread uh to be honest i uh

414
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,079
used the the cbo

415
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,600
r2

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
python package to this and just let the

417
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
default settings

418
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
so so there may be some some problem

419
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
with that

420
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
that i haven't find out i will uh i will

421
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
make note and dig

422
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,040
deeper into this problem and try to

423
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,639
try to

424
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,480
do the measurement again if it's okay

425
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,040
oh yes so yeah next slide

426
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,079
great well uh the thing

427
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,959
uh

428
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
the another feedback in the mailing list

429
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,079
was the comparison with already

430
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,480
well-known uh

431
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,599
protocols used uh

432
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,480
for

433
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,359
uh

434
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
for encoding the messages the examples

435
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,799
are avro protobufs captain proto thrift

436
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
and flood buffers

437
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,559
these were mentioned mentioned in the in

438
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
the feedback so uh the first and most

439
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,079
important thing is that none of the

440
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,480
above is standardized and i think that

441
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
it makes sense to

442
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
have some standard

443
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
just because uh

444
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
these these frameworks or protocols are

445
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,919
widely used so so having a standard

446
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,280
that is

447
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
well defined

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,360
makes sense in my opinion

449
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,919
i would like to repeat what bara has

450
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
well concise messages without schema

451
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
which means the messages are concise

452
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
it has the octet aligned messages with

453
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,000
the little indian representation

454
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,679
when possible the encoding is ejective

455
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,679
and

456
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,039
the butter is designed with the

457
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
simplicity in mind

458
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
what i've already said so uh next slide

459
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
please please yeah this is the

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
comparison of the

461
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
of the types

462
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,039
used and available in encoding

463
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,919
it's

464
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
kind of uh

465
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,360
how to say well

466
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
i

467
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
take the the take the types which are in

468
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,919
the barre

469
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,679
so it's obvious that every types here is

470
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,320
in bare this is just to

471
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,280
show uh how the others

472
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
uh

473
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
how did others protocols

474
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
are uh compared to body so uh we can see

475
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
that for uh

476
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,039
integers unsigned integers integers and

477
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,879
flows this for numbers

478
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,440
there are

479
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
i'm sorry

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,120
there are some some types missing

481
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
first

482
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
you ain't and eind are variable land uh

483
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
integers or on-site integers

484
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
next slide three please

485
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,080
yeah this is other standard types

486
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
you can see that for example data with

487
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,320
fixed land are really rare to be uh to

488
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,360
be you used or to be available in

489
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
other protocols

490
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,039
next please

491
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
uh and the last are yeah lists optional

492
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
and and and

493
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
so on

494
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
yeah next

495
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,400
please so this is summary of the of the

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
comparisons

497
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
uh when i

498
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,200
was researching the protobufs i really

499
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
got lost with the variable and integers

500
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
i'm sorry maybe something is misleading

501
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
on the on the previous slide i did it

502
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,120
with

503
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,679
my best knowledge and

504
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,760
tried to do it as

505
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,799
uh

506
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,360
as best as possible

507
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
another thing is that uh standard is it

508
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
was uh

509
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,840
hard to find out which types are

510
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
supported

511
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,720
i needed some to sometimes dig deeper

512
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
into into the

513
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
documentation or

514
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,559
it wasn't in the supported types or

515
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,200
things like that

516
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
other thing is that

517
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,440
of course other protocols

518
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,480
uh

519
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
have uh

520
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,919
more types or different types or another

521
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,480
types like table types or something like

522
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,360
that

523
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
but

524
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,280
but it tries to keep uh

525
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
keeping being simple

526
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,919
and uh

527
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
all the other types can be built

528
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,840
up

529
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
on the basic types of

530
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
of the barracks so this is the reason

531
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
why some some types are omitted

532
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
yes and the last one

533
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
there is clear

534
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
distinction between

535
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,159
primitive and aggregate types which was

536
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,640
sometimes in bahrain which was sometimes

537
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
also difficult in the other other

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,039
protocols so next please

539
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
yeah

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,559
this was a question about the future

541
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,559
extension points but it specifies uh or

542
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,919
for for message uh

543
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
uh for future message consideration but

544
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,760
i

545
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
suggest to use

546
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
unions

547
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
where

548
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,559
all the available versions are defined

549
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,520
in union and later the precation

550
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,960
just means that the first

551
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,480
first message has manually set attack in

552
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
the union

553
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,879
next please

554
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
the

555
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,480
uh feedback was the using data

556
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
or time

557
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
well

558
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
we decided to not

559
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
use space special

560
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
data type time type in bare

561
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
because a lot can be done just by using

562
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,400
timestamp or unsight integer

563
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
or

564
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
using

565
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,919
other specifications for date times and

566
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,600
pairs the

567
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
the date time

568
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,520
next please

569
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
yes and this is

570
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,679
all

571
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
i wanted to say

572
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
regarding pare

573
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
uh

574
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,320
yeah

575
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
there

576
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
are questions regarding the progress

577
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,080
within

578
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,960
ietf which i am not

579
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
sure how this should

580
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,120
go and we'll be happy for her help so

581
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
great thank you thank you so much for

582
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
your presentation and so i'd invite

583
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,760
people to join the queue either in a

584
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
person in the room or using the client

585
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
if you're able to

586
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
just to summarize we've had some

587
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
messages on the list so far um

588
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
suggesting sibor and others suggesting

589
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,440
that siebel is not a competitor um and i

590
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,960
think richard barnes posted just this

591
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
morning saying sees that as kind of a

592
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,919
tls plus 10 so a small focus working

593
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,600
group with his suggestion so just to

594
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
remind participants keep your answers

595
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
focused on the dispatch question should

596
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,000
this work progress and if so in what way

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
should it progress so we'll just call

598
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,679
through the queue in the order i see it

599
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,640
so um rich richard barnes first

600
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,000
thanks christy um so yeah i i appreciate

601
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
the sentiment where this working's

602
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,039
coming from when we did mls we needed a

603
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,799
compact encoding we went with tls

604
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,159
encoding which is

605
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
as i said on the thread you know 90

606
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
similar to this

607
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
level like the way structure and code

608
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,640
actually could exactly contact us

609
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
we had extended tests a little bit

610
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
sympathetic the idea that there's um

611
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
need for attention um so

612
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
it seems like they're it's not

613
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,120
implausible to me that you know it would

614
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
be useful to have a spec that was that

615
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
just encapsulated the syntax as opposed

616
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
to you know if i was continuing

617
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,159
referencing section four of rfc 446

618
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,159
and to extend it a little bit to cover

619
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,760
you know what kind of what people expect

620
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,559
from a modern encoding system i agree

621
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
there's there's a bunch of other binary

622
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,279
encoding systems but we've had a bunch

623
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
of success with tls syntax and and

624
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,480
lightly extend light extensions and tls

625
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
syntax in the atf so all right my

626
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,559
inclination here probably to do a small

627
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
focus working group

628
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
uh if we're going to do anything in kind

629
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,679
of a small focus room starting to us

630
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
adding the 10 that we need here

631
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,799
okay thank you richard and you broke up

632
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,360
quite a bit during that so just to um

633
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
clarify i heard that you were supportive

634
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,640
of

635
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
forming a small focused working group um

636
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
if that's not correct can you please put

637
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,279
it in the java chat and i will correct

638
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
myself um okay eric rescaler next in the

639
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
queue

640
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,799
uh i think richard was saying he

641
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,000
supported a small working group to

642
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
standardize the tls syntax not this um

643
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,919
that's not actually my position so i'm

644
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,120
just trying to mirror it um so

645
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
um

646
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,279
i'm not particularly interested in

647
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,120
technical details i'm much more

648
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,799
concerned about the deployment situation

649
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,640
there are a giant pile of existing

650
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,480
things like this as you indicated

651
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,559
earlier and the fact that none of them

652
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,320
are standards i think strongly indicates

653
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,120
there's not a lot of interest in

654
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,240
standardizing this and for us to

655
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
standardize yet another one without any

656
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,919
evidence of real market desire it seems

657
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,840
like a real fail so my question to you

658
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,799
is

659
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,720
which large constituencies want to use

660
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,880
this technology

661
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,799
padan may you repeat your question

662
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,600
i said which large constituencies wish

663
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,559
to use this technology

664
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
uh well the body is uh used at least at

665
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,559
source hut

666
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,320
which is the the company of the creator

667
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,279
of the encoding and they use it for

668
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,440
for

669
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
web tokens for storing web tokens and

670
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
communication with client

671
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,600
so at least this is the use case which

672
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
which is

673
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
used today

674
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
sure i think we can agree that sourcehut

675
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
is rather smaller than facebook and

676
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,559
google

677
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,559
definitely

678
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,640
we also had the feedback in the mailing

679
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,919
list

680
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
of some some researcher that

681
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,039
that

682
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,799
tried to find out the the

683
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,240
uh

684
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
something different than json for

685
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,480
receiving data from the sensors

686
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440
because of the measurements and this was

687
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
particular

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,960
case where yv uh allowed in the in the

689
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,480
standard the full compliance with i

690
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
triple e

691
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,919
754

692
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
floating

693
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,360
numbers for example so

694
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,720
okay well anyway my comment is this

695
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
should go nowhere until there's strong

696
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,600
evidence that people actually want to

697
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
use it and sourcehead is like not even

698
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
close to enough

699
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,720
uh

700
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,279
if uh you uh

701
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,480
or if if you need some some uh giant

702
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,039
company like google to backup this uh

703
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,799
specification i can't offer uh i can

704
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
offer nothing i don't have such a

705
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,320
company uh but uh

706
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,600
still i think uh there is a need for

707
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
standardization

708
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,480
of uh something similar to bare

709
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,320
uh that would be a simple

710
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
simply implemented which would be a safe

711
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,279
concise and uh

712
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,320
practically with the same uh same

713
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
properties

714
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,840
okay thank you

715
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
just um to say we only have a couple of

716
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
minutes left in this item so if

717
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,200
remaining participants can make their

718
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
comments short and i completely agree

719
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,840
that um implementation is an

720
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
implementation regardless of the size of

721
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
you know it doesn't have to be

722
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
anti-competitive in that kind of way of

723
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,279
having a certain size of implementer but

724
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,880
um i think the point might be more about

725
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,960
multiple vendors as is being discussed

726
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
in jabber um okay so next in the queue

727
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
is um cullen who's physically in the

728
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
queue i think

729
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,279
yes colin jennings thank you

730
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
i think it would be useful to

731
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,240
standardize something along these lines

732
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,039
at itf because we just constantly keep

733
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,559
repeating this and building it

734
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,000
individually in each protocol you know

735
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
we have a tls and then a slightly

736
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
different variant in mls and then and

737
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,799
then you know several of the drafts i'm

738
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,320
writing have a different sort of variant

739
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,559
so i think it would help us write drafts

740
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,320
to have a tool that we could pull out of

741
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
the box and use if we wanted obviously

742
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
we do sometimes use c boards sometimes

743
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
you use this sometimes other things so i

744
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
don't see any harm and i think it would

745
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
be useful to

746
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
pick uh maybe it's exactly this one

747
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
maybe it's something maybe it's the tls

748
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,799
one i don't really care but

749
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,600
to form something that we can refer to

750
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,360
and is standardized um and is roughly

751
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,600
along about the level of weight and

752
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,279
complexity that you're proposing here it

753
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,640
basically has exactly the sort of

754
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,399
characteristics of what you're proposing

755
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,840
i mean if there was no other proposals

756
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,679
i'd be fine with bear it looks it meets

757
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,240
my needs exactly um i wish it had a sink

758
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
like a half floating point thing like a

759
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
16-bit floating point too but i'm sure

760
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,720
we could add that

761
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
um so i think it would be worth doing

762
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,760
something like this i don't know if

763
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
there's a small working groups the right

764
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,440
way or whether we should you know have a

765
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360
bake off between several of the

766
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
proposals that could be used and see

767
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
what people want to want to go forward

768
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
with uh but i'd be in favor of having

769
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,559
something thanks

770
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
thank you

771
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
and we just run through there's someone

772
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
in jabber agreeing with you as well and

773
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,200
barry you're next

774
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,279
this is barry lieber um

775
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,520
first i'll say i agree with what uh

776
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,799
ecker said

777
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,440
the overhead in the ietf to just to

778
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
standardize one of these things is high

779
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
and we really need to see that that we

780
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,039
need it that it it's going to be adopted

781
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,960
um and that there's a pressing need for

782
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,039
it before we get into that so i have

783
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
comments from two different roles i am

784
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,559
one of the co-seabor co-chairs now i

785
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,360
have not spoken with my co-chair but i

786
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
would support discussing this in

787
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,000
seaboard i think uh paul's comment kind

788
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
of raises the

789
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
issue that this should have been chatted

790
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,360
about in seabor

791
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,320
to see what it what it adds whether

792
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
cyborg can be enhanced whether

793
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
it makes sense to proceed with

794
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
body or whatever it is

795
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,799
so

796
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,640
i think we should start the discussion

797
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,600
there

798
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,360
and as the

799
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,960
former ad who ad sponsored seabor

800
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
i highly

801
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,919
recommend not ad sponsoring anything

802
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,440
like this ever again that this really

803
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
needs to go through some sort of working

804
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,159
group whether it be seabor or a new

805
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,679
working group that we set up for the

806
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,880
purpose

807
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
but i'll go back to saying that i stress

808
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
what ecker said that we really need to

809
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,480
make sure we have a need for it before

810
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,159
we go through the effort

811
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,120
thanks

812
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,080
i will thank you barry

813
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,679
great thank you just um to our remaining

814
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,360
participants if you could be extremely

815
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,679
speedy in your comments um otherwise

816
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,360
i'll cut you off because we have a full

817
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
session today okay um john clenson

818
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,080
you're up next

819
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,840
i i

820
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
agree with barry and

821
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
ecker uh but i wanted to take a slightly

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
different cast on this

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,159
uh which is it every additional one of

824
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,360
these uh channeling marshall roles is an

825
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
interoperability problem because it

826
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,519
scientists offer a different direction

827
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,760
um and uh

828
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,919
and i i worry about the need for this uh

829
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,159
i worry about the compression arguments

830
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
in a world in which we

831
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,200
have the kinds of bandwidth we do today

832
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
and and the cheapness of storage we do

833
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,559
today

834
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,799
although i'd be happy to hear the way

835
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,640
that doesn't apply here

836
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
uh but uh

837
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,399
but if we're going to do anything of

838
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,158
this type i would rather see

839
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,279
an irtf group or an art area

840
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,039
charter and study effort or design team

841
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,279
to bring the various advocates of these

842
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,919
various formats together and see if they

843
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,679
can agree upon something

844
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,919
a single standard for these for this

845
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,159
class of things would probably move us

846
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,080
forward starting that discussion in

847
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
seaboard would be fine

848
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
but uh but moving off in all different

849
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,039
directions with more and more of these

850
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,919
is is a challenge for operability

851
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
and not helpful for the internet thanks

852
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,200
just to clarify you think the work

853
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
should go forward in some form

854
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,480
possibly through

855
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
a new group

856
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,960
and

857
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,279
um davidskenazi google uh so plus one to

858
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,159
the

859
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,720
folks that said this before the reason

860
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,440
that we have like

861
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,639
17 different non-standards in this space

862
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,639
is that every company

863
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,560
builds their own to fit their specific

864
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
needs and those are slightly different

865
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,879
from one another and that's why google

866
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,719
has protobuf for example and what google

867
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,040
hasn't like moved to standardize it here

868
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,719
because we want to keep change control

869
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,280
and modify it if we feel like it

870
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
so if source

871
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
wants its own format that's totally fine

872
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,719
it can use it

873
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
but unless there is a specific need from

874
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,119
other vendors i don't see

875
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,679
any reason to progress this in the ietf

876
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
so the other vendors don't need to be

877
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,359
the size of google obviously but there

878
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,719
needs to be

879
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,480
market interest from outside of one

880
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,879
specific vendor so my

881
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,040
personal thought on the dispatch

882
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,159
question is

883
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,839
do not progress this unless there is

884
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
interest from multiple folks interested

885
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,399
in implementing

886
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
okay thank you very much

887
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,060
so that's the end of our review

888
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,170
[Music]

889
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,680
um but just to say that what i'm hearing

890
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,400
so far and what i've seen on the list is

891
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,800
not a good fit

892
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,040
um

893
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
it doesn't necessarily have to be this

894
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,599
specific proposal and um we need to see

895
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,760
more um interest from rather than just

896
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
from one single participant so um

897
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
okay we'll move on to the next item and

898
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,359
refresh that at the end if you disagree

899
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,880
if i will leave

900
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,480
in chapter thank you very much jerry

901
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,720
thank you

902
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,839
okay so next up we have braun and i

903
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,920
think sheeping you're running the slides

904
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,880
all right thank you

905
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
hopefully when this appears in just a

906
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,839
second

907
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,078
no

908
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
i'll try and make this one a little bit

909
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
quicker and hopefully we can catch up

910
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,359
some time

911
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
hi kirsty could you please continue

912
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,079
i have some trouble

913
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,720
yeah sure no problem sorry bro

914
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,480
that's okay

915
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,520
cool there we go next slide please

916
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,880
let's let's get through this fairly

917
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
quickly i think describing these

918
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,119
situations fairly easy

919
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
basically you want to send a file from

920
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,119
party a to party b

921
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,640
but neither of them are guaranteed to be

922
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,079
online all the time so you have to store

923
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,160
it somewhere in between

924
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,079
ideally that third party that you're

925
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,640
storing the file with or random large

926
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,800
blob of data doesn't need to see the

927
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,240
content of it so you would prefer to

928
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,359
encrypt it

929
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,880
but then you have the issue of how do

930
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,440
you tell the receiving party

931
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,599
how it's encrypted and how to decrypt it

932
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,480
next slide please

933
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,760
sorry this text a little bit small but

934
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,400
ideally party a creates and encrypts the

935
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
blob up uploads the encrypted data

936
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,240
somewhere

937
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,320
tells party b

938
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,359
via

939
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
the the most

940
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,400
easy to read and easy to to use way

941
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,839
here's how you decrypt this when you've

942
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,200
downloaded it

943
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,599
and then party b downloads it

944
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,599
so this this slide is lots of noise

945
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,880
which you can read later next slide

946
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
please i'll show the the

947
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
diagram of traffic flow because that's

948
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
probably the easiest here

949
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,079
so

950
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,839
the tricky bit here is you have the uri

951
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,359
has to contain the key when it's sent to

952
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,200
party b and then not contain the key

953
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
when it's sent through to the file store

954
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,599
as party c because in that case it's

955
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
gone over the wire it's gone in logs it

956
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
can be stored and the data can then be

957
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,560
decrypted and we don't want party c to

958
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,599
ever see

959
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,280
the plain text

960
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,240
so

961
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
the question is how to do this next

962
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,079
slide please

963
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,240
oh yeah first i put in this

964
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,760
obviously it'll take time to get to

965
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,920
something like this but i'd like it to

966
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,079
be something that we can work towards

967
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,359
over time it's better if it's

968
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,800
standardized obviously there's been

969
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
heaps of non-standard versions of this

970
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,119
every messaging protocol has something

971
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,040
for this

972
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
so that's why i thought this makes sense

973
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
to come to the ietf the reason i came to

974
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
it in the first place is i want to

975
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,760
implement

976
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,599
large file attachments with email which

977
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
means putting a uri

978
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,599
somewhere in a mime part saying download

979
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
from here what we have at the moment is

980
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,320
that the uri has put as a link in the

981
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,960
html version of the body with

982
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,720
little or no annotation to say this is

983
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,400
an attachment at all but you can click

984
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
on it you can download it in whatever

985
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,720
email receiving program you have

986
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,400
i want the same thing

987
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,960
but without the place you're storing it

988
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,640
having to be able to see the plain text

989
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,000
as well

990
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,599
and that means it needs to be at a low

991
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,359
enough level that it's embedded in the

992
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,119
libraries rather than in every single

993
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
receiving program and so you can pass

994
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,680
the uri around as if it's plain text

995
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,119
and any program can then access it using

996
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,520
the low-level libraries

997
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,839
the issue here of course is that nothing

998
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,079
does that yet and unless it's a standard

999
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,079
nothing will do it

1000
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,320
and so we'll wind up having to wrap

1001
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
every single uri in every single little

1002
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,240
format in the same way

1003
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
i think the next might be the last slide

1004
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
which is an example of usage the next

1005
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
slide please

1006
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,359
on the justice league is in the queue

1007
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
uh questions at the end i think

1008
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,359
okay then we'll carry right on

1009
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,040
so oh yeah so possibilities for design

1010
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
i have no ideas um this is not my area

1011
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,640
of expertise i'd love someone else to

1012
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,240
take on this work

1013
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,320
and i will help you if i can but yeah on

1014
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
the last slide i have an example of yet

1015
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,520
another place

1016
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
where this would be useful that's not

1017
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,359
the use case that i had so go to the

1018
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,000
last slide

1019
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,440
and this is an example of a v card that

1020
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,920
i pulled from online and it has a link

1021
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,920
to a photo and the photo is value type

1022
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,200
uri

1023
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
i would love to be able to replace this

1024
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,119
with something that says link to a photo

1025
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,960
and the server where the photos stored

1026
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
can't see it

1027
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,200
and that

1028
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
to back port this into every single

1029
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
format with separate encryption keys

1030
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,920
very very difficult but if you could

1031
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
just say a uri

1032
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,599
gets downloaded and either has

1033
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,359
it it's just plain text from the server

1034
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,680
and downloaded plain text over https

1035
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,520
sure so you've got

1036
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,599
transport encryption but you don't have

1037
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,960
encryption on the server or you have

1038
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
encryption on the server and it's

1039
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,319
downloaded as encrypted data and then

1040
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,079
decrypted locally with a key that is

1041
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
embedded in the uri then you can just

1042
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,640
pass uris around and use either case and

1043
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
that's all i've got

1044
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,079
so questions comments

1045
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,839
thank you thank you ron for ever showing

1046
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,119
your work

1047
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,599
if people in the room are able to it

1048
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,359
would be very helpful if you could scan

1049
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,440
the qr code event that should allow you

1050
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
to register the meeting properly and

1051
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,599
help us with our cue management and

1052
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,280
first in the queue is ted hardy

1053
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
uh thanks everyone uh

1054
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
thanks ron for the work i actually got

1055
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
in the queue to ask a scope question so

1056
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
it's a little bit late um but uh back on

1057
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,040
slide four uh it looks like you had a

1058
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,079
party a a party b and a server but it

1059
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,560
wasn't clear what happened if you also

1060
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,960
had a party c d e f g h i j and k

1061
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,560
were you expecting each of them to be

1062
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,440
able to using the same decryption key

1063
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,160
for it the v card would tend to indicate

1064
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,680
that that was the case but in that

1065
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
situation

1066
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,960
it's sort of hard to figure out how any

1067
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
of those people can't reford it

1068
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,319
to party c to allow party c to have

1069
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,240
access to it so if you could just

1070
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
clarify this scope that would be useful

1071
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,680
yeah i think realistically

1072
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,200
if you get a copy of the url with the

1073
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,960
key you are party b

1074
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
if you don't get your party c there can

1075
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,720
be one or n of each of these parties

1076
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,520
so there's the party that has the blob

1077
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,800
and doesn't have a copy of the key and

1078
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,160
there's the party that has a copy of the

1079
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,839
key and the key can be considered a

1080
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,359
small version of the large data really

1081
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,640
conceptually

1082
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
so

1083
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,119
if you get the key

1084
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,560
then you can see the content if you

1085
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,760
don't have the key you can't say the

1086
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,040
content

1087
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,680
okay uh so in in a situation like that i

1088
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,040
think one of the things you've got to

1089
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,119
consider is whether you're you're you're

1090
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,200
actually better off

1091
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,000
uh associating these as two uris which

1092
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,640
have a relationship uh so you could have

1093
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,000
like a uri that says this is the

1094
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,839
um this is the place where you retrieve

1095
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,839
it and a different uri like a data uri

1096
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,040
that contains

1097
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,960
uh the decryption key that you want to

1098
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,880
send so that you actually then can use

1099
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,800
multiple different paths to give the

1100
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,359
data uri without necessarily always

1101
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,200
including it in

1102
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,079
the uri which is is used along uh the

1103
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,880
path that that part ec has um but i i

1104
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,040
think

1105
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,160
my question for that would be how do you

1106
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,680
pass that around in the existing

1107
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,880
channels that

1108
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,599
accept exactly one uri

1109
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,440
uh so

1110
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,200
that

1111
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,319
you that's a

1112
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,720
everything in in

1113
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,880
in in computer science can can be solved

1114
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,400
with one more layer of indirection you

1115
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
create a uh yeah i love carrying them

1116
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,839
both but the the upshot to this is i i

1117
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,440
really feel like

1118
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,160
what you're describing here um

1119
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,880
doesn't have very

1120
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
strong confidentiality characteristics

1121
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,480
in the multi-party case

1122
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
uh so i think you you'd really want to

1123
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,839
write a draft for the security

1124
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,079
considerations where you're describing

1125
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,560
what it is you're expecting

1126
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,359
the

1127
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,920
the characteristics of the

1128
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,440
um

1129
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
confidentiality or or

1130
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,720
other characteristics you're getting out

1131
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,560
of encrypting this data would be because

1132
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,040
i think yeah absolutely

1133
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,079
it's

1134
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
from the slides to figure out what it is

1135
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,920
this would deliver thanks yeah now this

1136
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,520
is very early stage and it's mostly just

1137
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,119
working out is this something the isf

1138
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,520
wants to do and if so where

1139
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
where should it happen um

1140
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,880
there's a lot more design work to do

1141
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,200
ted are you able to just answer that

1142
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,880
question

1143
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,520
in the idea

1144
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,720
i interest i don't think that there's

1145
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
it's people to answer that question

1146
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,760
without a draft that describes the

1147
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,079
security properties so i would say

1148
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,119
uh the dispatch answer would be not yet

1149
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,599
yeah okay so my my answer to that i

1150
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,880
guess since it's probably worth

1151
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,920
answering is that

1152
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,200
the confidentiality here is basically

1153
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,960
party b can leak the key to whoever they

1154
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,599
want to um if party b doesn't want to

1155
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,359
leak the key we want to make it easy for

1156
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,040
them to not accidentally leak the key to

1157
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,720
party c that is that is the main

1158
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
confidentiality requirement here rather

1159
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,079
than really really strong

1160
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
confidentiality which is the same as if

1161
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,200
you sent them the raw file they could

1162
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
leak it to whoever they want

1163
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
but we don't want them to accidentally

1164
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,079
do it easily

1165
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,760
thank you very much bronn okay um we

1166
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,359
have john mavine in the queue and i'd

1167
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,520
encourage people on jabba if you have

1168
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,440
comments or opinions on the dispatch

1169
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,119
outcome please join the queue which

1170
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
we'll be cutting shortly so john levine

1171
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,160
over to you

1172
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,040
yeah

1173
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,119
um as i'm sure you know this is not a

1174
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,880
new problem we have message external

1175
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,079
body going back probably 20 20 years and

1176
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,119
i think

1177
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,560
and which

1178
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,400
i think it was important back when email

1179
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,920
had to be tiny and then when the email

1180
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,520
sort of got medium-sized then people

1181
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,960
started putting in attachments and now

1182
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,079
we've come around again to the point

1183
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,200
where the files have gotten bigger than

1184
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,280
the mail servers again

1185
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,720
and i think this actually could be

1186
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,680
addressed

1187
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,359
so long as you are willing to

1188
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,040
restrict its use to places where you

1189
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
have mime bodies it will be pretty

1190
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,640
straightforward to extend message

1191
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,119
external external body to do this but

1192
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,560
you know basically you'd add some more

1193
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,000
stuff to the external body with the keys

1194
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,760
and the stuff and we already have the

1195
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,160
syntax to have a url elsewhere in the

1196
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
message that refers to the external body

1197
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,680
if you want people they will link to it

1198
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,400
um so i bought it i would want to try to

1199
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,680
see if we could make that work first

1200
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
because trying to invent a new york a

1201
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
new uri format that is like well this is

1202
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
a url but it also has passwords and

1203
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,720
stuff in it i think that would give

1204
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,440
heartburn to the people who worry about

1205
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
um

1206
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,119
uri syntax i i really don't want to do

1207
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,640
it at that level because then we've got

1208
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,359
yet another baroque custom format that's

1209
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,359
only in one place for handling this and

1210
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,200
every other place that you do uris needs

1211
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,040
to the same thing so i would love to say

1212
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,560
that whether it's

1213
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,000
unencrypted data at the other end or

1214
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,920
encrypted data at the other end

1215
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
you can ask your system library to

1216
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,599
please fetch this data make the

1217
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,280
transformations required give me the

1218
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
plain text

1219
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,880
so it's basically

1220
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
adding

1221
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,480
adding a decryption key to you to a

1222
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,240
general uri yes okay

1223
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,800
in a way that doesn't get sent to the

1224
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,440
server automatically

1225
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,800
does that affect your view on the

1226
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,160
dispatch outcome sean

1227
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,400
um

1228
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,680
i still think it's a problem worth

1229
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,000
solving i do but i i do think now we we

1230
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,040
want to

1231
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,480
but you know but basically ted and i are

1232
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,240
both saying like

1233
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
we heard fairly different things that

1234
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,480
ted has issues of who who can decode it

1235
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,559
i have issues of is this is this a mime

1236
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,480
type or is this a uri

1237
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,640
so i think i mean

1238
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,400
it definitely is

1239
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,599
if there were an appropriate working

1240
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,839
group

1241
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,559
since it came from email i suppose it

1242
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,640
could go to one of the email emails i

1243
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
don't think an email working group is

1244
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,760
the right place for this yeah

1245
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,520
i really don't yeah i guess and i don't

1246
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,720
i don't think an email working group

1247
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,880
should even be trying to do this work

1248
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,800
in the

1249
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,599
my

1250
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,760
headers necessarily i think this it's a

1251
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,440
better place to do it inside the uri if

1252
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,640
we possibly can but anyway

1253
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,400
i do think it's worth it's it's worth

1254
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,599
doing because i agree with ron that

1255
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,359
people do people have hacky ways of

1256
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,040
passing around files that are too big

1257
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,440
too big to embed all the time

1258
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,880
okay thank you so you think it's worth

1259
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,040
doing more detail needed perhaps a draft

1260
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,200
great um eric for schooler you're next

1261
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,240
in the queue

1262
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,760
yeah i think this is generally worth

1263
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,240
doing um as an aside i think that um the

1264
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,480
https plus blah blah blah is like don't

1265
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,119
do that but um yeah like i said i don't

1266
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,559
know much about this yeah sure what

1267
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,319
happened i this gentleman we're solving

1268
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,480
um i'm not as concerned as ted is about

1269
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,440
the um security properties i mean like

1270
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,280
they are what they are but that's if we

1271
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,319
just set the thing as you say if you're

1272
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,680
just something in the body be the same

1273
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,440
so um so it doesn't really bend me out

1274
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,599
of shape that much um in terms of

1275
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,359
location i see mark donnie himself

1276
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,319
behind me um it seems like probably

1277
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,599
this seems pretty small so i would tend

1278
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,520
to think http i know it's not quite a

1279
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,800
great fit for http but we've already

1280
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,079
kind of like done a bunch of some more

1281
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,680
crap with like you know encrypted bodies

1282
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
and stuff so it seems like it kind of

1283
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
sort of belongs um

1284
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
uh i suppose i suppose there's an http

1285
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,920
it may have to be a new working group

1286
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,520
which is like kind of heavyweight um but

1287
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,040
mark may have a different opinion yeah

1288
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,559
there was a comment on the mailing list

1289
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,720
that the tigris working group might be a

1290
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,000
place as well

1291
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,440
yeah

1292
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,319
yeah

1293
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,079
if you if you if you wanted to be like

1294
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,920
bogged down in secrets forever secret i

1295
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,280
think tigress has got like a much like

1296
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,720
bigger kind of remit so i mean maybe

1297
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,920
there's some way to carve this off but i

1298
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,280
worry it's going to get clogged onto the

1299
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,960
bigger thing but i don't feel strongly

1300
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,480
about it

1301
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,839
okay thank you very much we'll cut the

1302
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,319
key there and say nottingham you are in

1303
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,480
the queue

1304
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,559
that's the disembodied head hello

1305
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,559
oh good i'm here oh good

1306
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,119
um yeah i i um mark nottingham i

1307
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,800
kind of feel like this is an area that

1308
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,240
that is

1309
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,760
prone to over engineering if we're not

1310
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,720
careful

1311
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,520
uh the the most you know if you don't

1312
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,400
want

1313
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
if you want to communicate a key with

1314
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,440
the uri but you don't want to send it on

1315
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,960
the request the most obvious way to do

1316
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,359
those fragment identifiers as you saw

1317
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,119
and in in

1318
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,319
you with the uri is the fragment

1319
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,160
identifiers defined by the format so

1320
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,079
define a format with a fragment

1321
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,359
identifier um as i said in in chat

1322
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,359
uh i think the important part here to

1323
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,440
satisfy a lot of concern is

1324
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,119
uh to describe the security properties

1325
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,440
of that thing in in the draft and we'll

1326
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,960
see where where we where we get from

1327
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,880
there um that that to me seems like the

1328
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
most straightforward way possible i feel

1329
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,040
like if we we throw this to uh other

1330
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,119
venues or other approaches we might come

1331
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,920
up with an over complicated solution

1332
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
cool can i ask you to help me with this

1333
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,079
one

1334
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
yeah but here's the problem we live in

1335
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
the same city i can i can get that

1336
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,400
that's fine

1337
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,880
all right let's do that when i get back

1338
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,480
super thank you very much brown for

1339
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,640
presenting your work i think there i was

1340
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,040
hearing um that a bit more details

1341
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
needed to understand the scope of the

1342
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,160
problem but the problem is certainly

1343
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,760
worth addressing and a couple of

1344
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,200
potential avenues going forward

1345
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,599
depending on the detail that comes from

1346
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,800
that draft or a bit more scoping

1347
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,240
okay if you disagree with that then

1348
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,319
please uh do raise it in jabba and we'll

1349
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,599
summarize at the end of the session as

1350
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,359
always so thank you very much and

1351
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,040
handily we've got mark nottingham here

1352
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,280
ready to present his draft um and

1353
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,440
sheeping is driving the site for us so

1354
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,160
off you go mark thank you

1355
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,760
thank you um

1356
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,359
so this is going to be extremely short

1357
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,759
ecker

1358
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,599
do you have a question or

1359
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,599
or is the video frozen

1360
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,359
i think the video is frozen never mind i

1361
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,800
just have this haunting image of ecker

1362
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,640
standing at the queue waiting to speak

1363
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,520
it's a little disconcerting okay so

1364
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,599
uh this is gonna be very short i think

1365
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,839
uh this is about a draft that i wrote uh

1366
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,520
i think now a couple months ago privacy

1367
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,599
considerations for web feed readers next

1368
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,240
slide please

1369
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,440
um so uh

1370
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,400
people have have kind of

1371
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
assumed that that web feed you know web

1372
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,200
feed so rss adam that sort of thing are

1373
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,559
dead that they're not really interesting

1374
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,960
anymore uh in my experience and from

1375
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,880
talking to people that's not necessarily

1376
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,800
true next slide

1377
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,680
um

1378
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
on the consumption side there's a pretty

1379
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,400
vibrant ecosystem of different feed

1380
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
readers and different consumers uh that

1381
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,520
have built some sort of feed reading

1382
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,319
capacity into them

1383
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,240
there's your standard kind of desktop

1384
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,400
feed readers there's online feed readers

1385
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,559
there are products that aren't

1386
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,400
feed centric that also use them in

1387
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,640
really interesting ways for example

1388
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,319
the kind of top middle shell looking

1389
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,880
logo there is devin think which is a

1390
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,440
kind of uh

1391
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,559
a very interesting academic tool

1392
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,640
for aggregating information that uses

1393
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,480
feeds extensively if you choose to use

1394
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,359
it that i happen to use quite a bit

1395
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,920
next slide

1396
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,280
on the producer side i think most people

1397
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,040
are aware that there are a lot of feeds

1398
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,000
out there

1399
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,440
um still

1400
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,640
there's still a lot of sites that

1401
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,240
produce them you know by default either

1402
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,680
because the underlying

1403
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,000
tools uh generate them or because they

1404
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,200
have some constituency for that um to

1405
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,280
get some sort of metric on that and and

1406
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,520
just because i was interested i wrote a

1407
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,000
little tool to scrape uh the people you

1408
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,400
follow on twitter to see how many of

1409
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,040
their profile urls had feeds and it

1410
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,640
turns out that for most people that i

1411
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,640
checked about a third of the profile

1412
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,280
feeds of the people they followed

1413
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,160
actually had uh sorry profile urls had

1414
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,680
feeds which was really really

1415
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,280
interesting to me that that you know

1416
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,359
there's this latent kind of you know

1417
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,280
ecosystem of feeds out there that is

1418
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,359
just waiting to be used if people bother

1419
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,720
to use it uh next slide

1420
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,960
and and that to me is is kind of a bit

1421
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,559
of a theme i think for for how i think

1422
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,319
about this you know the feeds web feeds

1423
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,839
are our latent platform on the internet

1424
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,520
they're they're out there people don't

1425
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,040
think about them a lot

1426
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,119
but they're still used every day and

1427
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,720
they're still available

1428
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,599
and

1429
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,160
next slide

1430
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,760
you know

1431
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,680
when i say platform i mean things like

1432
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,200
you know what people call the web

1433
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,520
platform so this this you know ecosystem

1434
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,359
that you can build on top of the the

1435
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,200
obvious you know big one out there being

1436
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,200
the web of course uh next slide

1437
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,559
but unlike the web feeds aren't really

1438
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,480
advertising driven they have a lot of

1439
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,319
really unique properties as

1440
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,240
compared to the web the information you

1441
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,559
get in feeds has a different tenor

1442
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,960
because it's not able to be you know

1443
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,040
advertising driven usually next slide

1444
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
and so that makes me think what can be

1445
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,960
done to improve and protect that

1446
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,559
platform how can we

1447
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,400
uh bolster it so that it's more useful

1448
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,240
to the people who want to use it it

1449
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,720
hasn't gotten a lot of love from the itf

1450
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,440
for for several years now but but

1451
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,520
what can we do to change that i guess

1452
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,079
next slide

1453
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,839
and so that's what led me and that's

1454
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,960
kind of the thinking behind this draft

1455
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,599
um it's a draft talking about what are

1456
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,200
the privacy considerations for this

1457
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,119
platform you know when you're you're

1458
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,720
making requests when you're handling

1459
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,160
content how should a a a feed reader uh

1460
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,359
what in in http uh terms would be a user

1461
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,119
agent how should it behave regarding

1462
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,559
user privacy

1463
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,040
uh next slide

1464
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,480
and i think that that's all i have at

1465
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,799
this point this is very very early stage

1466
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,720
i probably could have taken this equally

1467
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,920
easily just to the uh apps area because

1468
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,040
sorry art area because uh i just want to

1469
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,319
kind of give people a heads up that i'm

1470
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,680
thinking about this and starting to talk

1471
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,119
to people about it

1472
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,359
um i'd love to hear any feedback people

1473
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,400
have

1474
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,480
from a dispatch standpoint i think it's

1475
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,160
too early to dispatch anything like this

1476
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,760
to another place but i would love to

1477
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,520
talk about maybe

1478
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,720
getting a mailing list or something like

1479
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,880
that so i just i'm just

1480
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,400
mostly this is just a heads up but also

1481
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,920
i'm curious to hear if anybody has any

1482
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,680
feedback or or any kind of comments

1483
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,000
about it

1484
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,400
and my video is frozen because zecker is

1485
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,079
still just standing at the queue so i

1486
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,799
can't see the room

1487
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,160
i found him

1488
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,040
okay come on i think i have to reload

1489
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,839
the page to unfreeze the video

1490
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,359
unfortunately that's okay um folks any

1491
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,799
comments questions support for a mailing

1492
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
list disdain a mailing list

1493
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,440
absolute outrage at the creation of a

1494
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,599
mailing list thank you paul hoffman and

1495
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,359
we'll get other people joining the cube

1496
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,400
paul hoffman off you go

1497
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,440
paul hoffman surprised that i'm not

1498
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,200
seeing more sport i definitely support

1499
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,559
this um when we did adam hub you know in

1500
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,880
the paleolithic era there was a lot of

1501
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,960
interest a lot of stuff happened it

1502
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,280
became invisible but as mark said is

1503
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,400
still there

1504
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,880
um adding privacy even talking about

1505
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,280
privacy would be a good thing because

1506
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,599
this is definitely part of the ecosystem

1507
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,720
still

1508
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,640
um it's not like we we're trying to do

1509
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,880
an art i assume mark is not trying to

1510
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,040
make this more important and you know

1511
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,880
web 3.5 or whatever um but just you know

1512
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,480
something to say we

1513
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,160
you know we started something we should

1514
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,599
we should keep working on it in a

1515
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,240
privacy level so definitely interested i

1516
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,520
think a mailing list would be a

1517
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,160
reasonable start and um

1518
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,079
if if it needs to be a working group i

1519
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,480
think it can be uh you know an easily

1520
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,640
set up with later but a mailing list for

1521
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,559
this and talking about other

1522
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,040
privacy issues

1523
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,119
especially across formats would be just

1524
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,680
fine thank you

1525
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,880
comments

1526
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,440
no

1527
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,960
yes so we could go to the meeting list

1528
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
for more discussions

1529
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,480
yeah okay thank you

1530
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,200
thank you very much

1531
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,520
presenting mark yep so i think the

1532
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,079
outcome there again disagree in java if

1533
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,599
this is wrong but it sounds like we

1534
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,839
would create a mailing list for further

1535
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:10,960
discussion

1536
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,760
um

1537
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,119
and a couple of plus ones they're

1538
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,480
starting a list and seeing how much

1539
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,240
energy there is and hoping it will get

1540
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,119
people

1541
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,839
thinking about rss more so super

1542
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,799
move on to our next presenter

1543
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,760
hello welcome can everybody hear me okay

1544
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
closer closer all right that's why i did

1545
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,359
it all right thanks everybody good

1546
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,839
even closer how about

1547
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:38,640
that this is why we tested is that good

1548
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,640
a little better right good awesome hey

1549
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,400
thanks everybody for having me today

1550
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,160
online i got bradley peabody with me

1551
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,839
other co-author of this today we're

1552
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,240
going to talk about new uuid formats

1553
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,799
really it's new uid versions next slide

1554
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,040
please

1555
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,200
so one of the a couple of the problems

1556
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,160
with rfc 4122

1557
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,520
is that

1558
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,640
the main timestamp based uuid suffer

1559
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,119
poorly from database index locality

1560
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,160
problems

1561
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,880
the uuid version one that we call it has

1562
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,760
a very uncommon epoch choice the

1563
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,920
gregorian epoch which goes to a

1564
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,319
timestamp length of 100 nanoseconds

1565
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,720
which is pretty odd right and then to

1566
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,640
further compound that problem they split

1567
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,359
the epoch up into a weird a weird way

1568
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,839
sorry get my hands out there and it just

1569
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,240
causes all kinds of weird issues so

1570
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,079
we've taken an examination of that and

1571
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,440
figured out a different way to do it and

1572
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,960
we actually found a lot of people

1573
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,680
internet who are untangling that epoch

1574
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,240
and just slapping a version 4 on it so

1575
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,520
we're going to try and standardize that

1576
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,200
as version 6. so the people who are

1577
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,400
doing this and

1578
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,319
want the benefit of it have a place to

1579
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,720
do that in a standard track

1580
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,400
we've also got some

1581
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,760
security concerns that we want to

1582
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,280
address such as things like mac

1583
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,119
addresses in the uuid

1584
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,280
and using cryptographically secure

1585
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,200
pseudorandom generators

1586
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,880
and then

1587
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,720
we need some better clarifications

1588
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,280
around uuid generation versus uuid

1589
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,720
storage in terms of things like

1590
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,520
databases and overall just a lot of

1591
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,440
clarifications around little things like

1592
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,119
big indian versus little indian stuff

1593
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,640
that the errada's have an opened on 4122

1594
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,000
and we've kind of tried to address as

1595
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,160
many of these as we could in this update

1596
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,839
to

1597
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:21,280
4122 under some of our new versions and

1598
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,720
i'll go through those real quick real

1599
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,919
fast next slide

1600
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:26,880
okay

1601
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,359
so uui version six like i said is it's

1602
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,440
the time based input it's the same as

1603
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,440
uuid version one we're just not

1604
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,960
swizzling around the bits we're taking

1605
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,720
the timestamp as it is

1606
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,040
that hundred nanosecond gregorian epoch

1607
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
and we're laying it down and then the

1608
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,040
rest of the uid layout is exactly the

1609
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,960
same and this is something that many

1610
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,480
many many

1611
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,160
places have been doing and they either

1612
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,920
put like a version zero on it which is

1613
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,000
weird or they throw it as a version six

1614
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,640
so it looks like it's a random address

1615
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,400
but that's all we're doing with the

1616
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,240
version six so we're just labeling what

1617
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,520
other people are doing out there right

1618
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,119
now and giving them a place to do it

1619
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,200
officially we also make the subtle hint

1620
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,880
to try and not use mac addresses but

1621
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,079
we're not going to outright say you

1622
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,240
can't use mac addresses because if we

1623
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,920
want to you know have a one-to-one

1624
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,520
conversion and people want to swap from

1625
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,119
version one to version six they can do

1626
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,880
that under this pretty easily

1627
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,760
next slide please

1628
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,000
so version seven has really been the

1629
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,040
focus right of this we've looked at this

1630
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,119
and we've said what can we do better if

1631
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,200
we were going to make a time-based uuid

1632
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,839
right now and the obvious thing is to

1633
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,680
use a better epoch which is the

1634
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,000
well-known unix epoch and then it comes

1635
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,880
into

1636
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,599
questions like how long do we make this

1637
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,319
what precision level do we make this and

1638
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,000
there's been a lot of back and forth and

1639
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,200
we ended up laying down a 48-bit unix

1640
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,240
epoch with a millisecond time stamp and

1641
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,480
the rest of the uuid layout is random

1642
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,119
it's entropy and you can move the slider

1643
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,880
left and right and if we move a little

1644
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,280
bit more time stamp we get one side of

1645
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,880
the field who's really angry if we move

1646
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,359
it to the other way and give it you know

1647
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,079
less time stamp the entropy folks uh you

1648
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,799
know

1649
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,039
both sides are very heated we laid on

1650
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,920
and landed on millisecond time stamp so

1651
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,599
that it's the most ubiquitous to

1652
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,119
implement there's lots of libraries that

1653
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,119
can do this the timestamp is very well

1654
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,839
known it caters 99 of the use cases

1655
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,400
next slide

1656
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,319
for those other one percent of the use

1657
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,000
cases those folks that want to use a

1658
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,760
custom epoch they want to start

1659
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,119
something right now and start counting

1660
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,440
up time they want to use nanosecond

1661
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,359
level they can use uuiv version 8 which

1662
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,760
is every bit of this except for the

1663
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,200
version of the variant

1664
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,760
are for you to use in anything you want

1665
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,480
this future proofs our spec allows

1666
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,119
very custom uuids to have a space

1667
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,039
experimental uuids to have a space

1668
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,799
versus slapping a version 4 on it they

1669
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,520
can do that under version 8. if you want

1670
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,280
to take version 7

1671
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,599
fork it and do whatever you want with it

1672
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,599
you can do it within the space of a uuid

1673
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,160
version 8.

1674
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,200
next slide

1675
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,920
lastly this is kind of an oddball uuid

1676
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,079
but we're just writing down and saying

1677
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,720
that the maximum value for uuid

1678
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,720
is being defined in the spec which is

1679
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,359
all bit set to a one 4122 sets the nil

1680
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,559
uuid

1681
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,880
as all bits set to zero we're just

1682
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,400
writing down the opposite of that so

1683
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,160
that library generators can actually

1684
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,000
write this down and reserve it so you

1685
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,839
don't use it in some weird way this is

1686
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,599
for some needle and haystack operations

1687
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,520
there's a github thread about why you

1688
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,799
might use this

1689
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,559
but we kind of have a small section

1690
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,240
about this maximum uuid

1691
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,079
next all right so we've done a lot of

1692
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,839
prototyping we've done a lot of data

1693
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,839
modeling we've been working on this for

1694
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:50,799
i mean

1695
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,000
brad's been working on for about three

1696
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,200
years i've been working on for about two

1697
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,280
years we have taken everything we've

1698
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,880
done with library implementers

1699
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,119
prototypes and and put this into kind of

1700
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,640
a swan song to the implementers out

1701
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,960
there we've solved a lot of problems and

1702
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,720
whether it be you using

1703
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,119
version 7 or making your own under

1704
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,760
version 8 we have a really nice list of

1705
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,079
what you should do or should not do some

1706
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,240
of these are like time stamp granularity

1707
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,079
reliability source precision and

1708
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,480
accuracy fuzzing altering smearing

1709
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,559
padding or truncating right your uuids

1710
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,799
let's say you can only generate 32-bit

1711
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,200
unix timestamp how do you make that work

1712
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,559
in the 48-bit

1713
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,000
space

1714
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,240
monaticity encounters for when things

1715
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
need to be laid down in a database in an

1716
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
exact order how do you do that what's

1717
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,000
the placement that makes sorting really

1718
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,920
nicely how do you generate those or seed

1719
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,520
those from the beginning how do you

1720
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,680
increment those is it a random increment

1721
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,920
or is it a linear increment

1722
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,799
and

1723
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,440
other topics like distributed uuid

1724
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,520
generation across multi

1725
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,839
nodes that may not talk

1726
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,000
collision resistance mechanisms local

1727
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,640
and global uniqueness csr

1728
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,319
unguessability through csp rng sorting

1729
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,200
considerations opacity and introspection

1730
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,960
database considerations we talked about

1731
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,400
really briefly about how's the best

1732
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,760
what's the best way to store these in a

1733
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,440
database and then finally of course

1734
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,359
security considerations we've gone at

1735
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,760
great lengths to really put the last

1736
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,599
half of this document as a

1737
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,760
this is what you should do and this is

1738
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
the best way to do it based on all of

1739
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,240
our research

1740
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
and then last slide i just want to talk

1741
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,839
real quick about

1742
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,559
do we have a need yes there's a lot of

1743
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,119
energy from our community on the next

1744
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,000
generation of uuids a lot of people like

1745
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,720
uuid version seven and you can see that

1746
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,160
yes column in the middle almost

1747
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,079
everybody is implementing that i have a

1748
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,160
lot of uuid version eights out there

1749
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,559
that i have to find that are folks who

1750
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,920
really liked what we had maybe in a

1751
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,440
previous draft and we tweaked something

1752
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,640
and they said i'll just i'll keep that

1753
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,839
i'll put it as an eight and then they

1754
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,440
just throw an eight on it and gives them

1755
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,520
the space to do that there's more

1756
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,440
implementations but those are on version

1757
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,319
two or version one of our draft so

1758
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,160
they're slowly being updated but you can

1759
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,920
see there's a lot of different languages

1760
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,200
there's a lot of different folks who

1761
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,960
have contributed to this and there's a

1762
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,000
lot of energy around getting that uuid

1763
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,079
out there and standardized in a new way

1764
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,359
and that's it i'll take questions

1765
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,839
comments or concerns

1766
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
okay folks um

1767
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,839
thank you very much guys for your

1768
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,599
presentation

1769
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,440
give people time to join the queue

1770
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,839
either in the room or virtually any

1771
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:34,079
questions comments and don't forget the

1772
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,680
dispatch question should this work go

1773
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,119
forward and if so in what form so first

1774
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,799
in the queue we have david scanasi

1775
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,079
thank you davidskenazi google um thanks

1776
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,160
for this presentation like that was

1777
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,640
exactly what i like what we were kind of

1778
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,920
looking to hear and so thank you clearly

1779
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,839
there's interest in this and clearly

1780
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,880
you've done a lot of homework uh i would

1781
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,119
like to see this published it sounds

1782
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,400
useful

1783
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,319
as far as

1784
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,920
dispatching it um

1785
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,520
if is there if there is an ad willing to

1786
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,119
de-sponsor this that might be the

1787
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,240
simplest path forward but otherwise

1788
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,079
maybe a very small tightly scoped

1789
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,559
working group with a single deliverable

1790
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,799
would work um i'm just trying to find

1791
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,359
like the least resistance way of doing

1792
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,839
this but i think this should get

1793
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:28,799
published

1794
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,720
thank you we

1795
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,880
definitely scoped this to fix exactly

1796
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,960
the problems we needed and took anything

1797
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,680
else out of 41 22 and set it to the side

1798
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,119
and said somebody else can fix those

1799
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,799
problems this is what we want to focus

1800
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,799
on

1801
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,480
okay so strong support there any

1802
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,200
other supporters any questions

1803
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,799
comments we're going to need more

1804
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:54,240
support than just one person here

1805
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,160
you can see colin jennings in the queue

1806
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,559
colin jennings uh

1807
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,640
you know i i support the idea of forming

1808
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,400
a working group to sort of deal with the

1809
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,240
care and feeding of uu ids like if you

1810
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,240
go and list look at all the traffic that

1811
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,720
these guys had about the nuances of this

1812
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,160
it's it's one of those things with a lot

1813
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,760
of subtle complexities that sort of

1814
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,960
break things like who would have thought

1815
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,399
of the database and you know i mean

1816
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,238
there's all these issues so i think

1817
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,880
having a long-term sort of place where

1818
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,600
uh if any of these updates come we get

1819
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,439
the knowledge in one place that sort of

1820
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,439
knows the history of why things are the

1821
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,960
way the way they are and what went right

1822
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,640
and what went wrong is probably pretty

1823
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,319
good and there's a lot of errata on

1824
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,238
those drafts too that just point out

1825
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:35,839
like wow like we probably should be

1826
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:37,839
doing a little better i'm keeping those

1827
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,198
as

1828
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,880
well maintained standards i believe

1829
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
might be the words that come to mind uh

1830
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,040
so i'd be in favor of doing something

1831
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,158
that allowed this to be a

1832
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,879
well-maintained standard

1833
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,278
thank you thank you very much

1834
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,120
thanks alyssa cooper so i was just

1835
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
looking at the history of 4122 which

1836
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,600
also looks like it was 80s sponsored but

1837
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,238
i wasn't here at the time um so i don't

1838
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,520
know ted or

1839
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,399
very

1840
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,479
people who remember um if that was a

1841
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,759
good choice

1842
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,399
but um agree with colin that

1843
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,759
it might be that that wasn't a great

1844
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,520
choice and that's why like we have a

1845
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,439
pile of erada and other other things so

1846
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,040
it's worth like learning from that

1847
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,198
experience and

1848
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,960
having that inform what we do next

1849
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,640
thank you very much

1850
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,279
and there's a comment in the chat from

1851
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,520
lucas howdy just saying this works seems

1852
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,479
valuable if only for uuid version 4.

1853
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,399
um eric risk you're in the queue

1854
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,479
yeah um so this does seem like a

1855
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,679
reasonably compelling argument that

1856
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,520
something needs to be done um just

1857
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,120
looking at the body of work here i think

1858
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,399
would be an appropriate day to sponsor

1859
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,238
it um like does much work behind it

1860
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,440
should be working grouping if it's a

1861
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,120
very fast working group because

1862
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,080
that's like how things get handled

1863
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,679
okay then um

1864
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,560
murray's noted that rfc four one two two

1865
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,120
is a d sponsored by ted so it seems like

1866
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,239
the

1867
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,239
mood of the room is either um that the

1868
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,159
work should go forward um and it should

1869
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,320
go forward in the least friction full

1870
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,960
way possible so um either a small

1871
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,719
tightly sketched working group or an ad

1872
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,560
sponsorship um

1873
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,320
murray as the 80 in the room any

1874
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,400
comments on your view or something for

1875
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,640
us to pick offline and discuss

1876
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,159
um

1877
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,679
i think probably the next step that i

1878
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,600
would like to see is who would be

1879
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,960
willing to help develop a charter for

1880
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,960
this

1881
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,000
stroke

1882
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,520
so as soon as i ask anyone to sign up

1883
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,320
and actually do the work

1884
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,320
um

1885
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,159
i guess we can ask on the list for for

1886
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,600
help developing a charter but that's

1887
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,280
sound that's i'm hearing that's probably

1888
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,920
the preferred way to go

1889
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,800
and i can i can take up um

1890
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,400
whatever the responsibility rule for

1891
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,840
that is

1892
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,239
yes thank you i can see um a couple of

1893
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,480
comments in java as well where my group

1894
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,719
sounds good or working group is the path

1895
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,960
um and there maybe there's some

1896
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,239
discussion to be had about whether it

1897
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,000
should just be for this draft or if it

1898
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,840
could be a more general long-term care

1899
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,480
for uuids and but that would be worked

1900
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,360
out in the charter i suppose so

1901
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,520
i think there's no more comments no more

1902
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,120
people in the queue so we'll just say

1903
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,560
thank you very much kaiser i think we

1904
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,640
have our dispatch outcome and thanks

1905
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,480
very much for taking the time to present

1906
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,920
to us here

1907
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,239
and so we move on to our last agenda

1908
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,239
items today the discarding priority of

1909
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,480
rpp video packets there's been quite a

1910
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,640
bit of discussion on the list about this

1911
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,000
um

1912
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,080
so we'll just stop sharing the slides if

1913
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,120
that's the issue thing and i can share

1914
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:51,840
the

1915
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,080
new slides

1916
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,880
there we go

1917
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,400
and just hold it

1918
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,520
can you hear me clearly yes cool

1919
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,080
all right um my name is legendo i'm

1920
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,000
going to present less discarding

1921
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,880
priority rtb video packets

1922
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,120
in this presentation i mainly want you

1923
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,080
to

1924
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,920
want to show you that you know the

1925
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,080
importance of the packet payload would

1926
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,320
decide the discarding priority of the

1927
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,600
packets when network congestion happens

1928
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,719
so

1929
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,800
then i also want to discuss how to

1930
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,520
achieve this prioritize discarding when

1931
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,760
network congestion happens through the

1932
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,400
dsp field and mapping next slide please

1933
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,239
um as all we know that rtp is a protocol

1934
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,800
dedicated for transport of real-time

1935
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,239
video and you know audio streams and are

1936
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,000
typically on top of udp

1937
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,080
so there is no guarantee of packet

1938
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,280
delivery um rtp packet formats for

1939
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,080
different video codecs have been

1940
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,679
specified

1941
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,880
in ietf for you know various

1942
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,440
codecs

1943
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,560
and by reading those drafts i i found

1944
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,760
out that

1945
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,679
they are actually um

1946
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,640
priority indicator of the packets in

1947
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,000
those

1948
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,560
rtp headers or say

1949
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,159
um

1950
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,880
they called an ar headers so i will

1951
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
briefly talk about those in the next

1952
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,719
following slides next slide please

1953
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,000
uh so for for h.264

1954
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,800
the coded video data is organized into

1955
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,320
the in our units and then

1956
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,080
the rtp packet for h.264 video inherits

1957
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,960
the same and air unit header so it has

1958
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,000
two bits here called an ri

1959
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,560
field it indicates the relative

1960
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,960
importance and transport priority of the

1961
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,760
layer unit determined by the encoder so

1962
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,560
the higher value of the mri shows the

1963
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,800
higher importance of that packet or

1964
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,239
another unit

1965
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,600
and they have different types of

1966
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,480
[Music]

1967
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,280
packet payload structures for a single

1968
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,080
on our unit so there is only one snail

1969
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,840
unit inside

1970
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,120
the payload and then that another field

1971
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,400
would be associated with a single air

1972
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,520
unit for aggregation packets

1973
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,040
there are multiple in their units into

1974
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,600
aggregated into a single rtp payload so

1975
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,159
the value of the

1976
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:39,280
rnri is the maximum of the old air units

1977
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,159
carried in aggregation packets and then

1978
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,679
for the fragmentation units

1979
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,480
it means that a single nri

1980
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,040
on the air unit actually is fragmented

1981
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,320
into multiple rtp packets so

1982
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,120
as you can imagine all fu packets will

1983
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,440
have the stem and ri

1984
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,480
value

1985
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,080
um

1986
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,600
and from quoted from this draft so

1987
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,000
for more important

1988
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,960
units

1989
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,440
needs to be better protected against the

1990
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,080
transmission loss of packet dropping

1991
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,640
than less important than our units

1992
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,199
let's go to the next slide um and then

1993
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,840
yeah just on the slide change sorry um a

1994
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,679
quick reminder time you remind her that

1995
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,840
master oh okay okay i'll go quickly for

1996
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,719
the next

1997
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,159
few months

1998
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,840
to wear a mask

1999
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,320
oh okay to wear a mask if you're present

2000
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,239
in the room that's part of the ietf

2001
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,679
requirements unless you have an

2002
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,120
exemption for it

2003
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,040
so to put on a mask

2004
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,280
okay do you want me to take the mask

2005
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,440
right now no no you're fine i'm fine

2006
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,920
okay it's for people in the room okay

2007
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,840
all right

2008
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:56,159
okay and and then for svc um

2009
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,360
it also has this mri two bits to

2010
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,520
indicate the relative importance and

2011
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,360
transport priority

2012
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,840
additionally it has three bytes in the

2013
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,920
entire unit header

2014
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,040
which

2015
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,600
includes the pr id which is called

2016
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,760
priority id which has six bits and also

2017
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,520
did qid and tid because

2018
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,239
svc actually supports the different

2019
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:25,040
levels of scalability

2020
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,000
next slide please

2021
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,159
and for

2022
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:30,960
h.265

2023
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,400
because it has improved sport of

2024
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,400
temporal scalability over h.264

2025
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,120
includes this tid which is three bits

2026
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,159
so it indicates the temporal layer of

2027
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,000
that packet belongs to so the lower

2028
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,640
temporal layer means more importance

2029
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,400
because it's the base layer it will be

2030
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,800
used to predict other layers

2031
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,159
so the ti

2032
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,040
the lower value of tid means more

2033
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,320
important of that packet

2034
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,080
for layer eye it is now used in h.365 go

2035
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,960
to next slide please

2036
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,480
and so for h.266

2037
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,080
it has the layer id and tid similar as

2038
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:22,080
h.265 however uh yeah additionally

2039
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,679
um similar to h.265 of course the tid

2040
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,000
indicates the relative importance

2041
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,679
and then has addition this layer id uh

2042
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,520
which is six bits

2043
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,360
uh it is

2044
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,280
further indicates how important the

2045
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,480
layer id is um sorry further uh

2046
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,520
indicates how important this packet is

2047
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,239
go go to the next slide

2048
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,600
yeah um just to let you know there's

2049
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,040
someone in the queue would you like to

2050
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,040
take questions now or at the end of the

2051
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,679
presentation

2052
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,600
i can ask it now real quick uh just a

2053
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,880
informational

2054
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,679
uh comment there's a name sorry

2055
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,400
mozinati uh cisco

2056
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,960
mozinati cisco um

2057
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,360
there's a draft in abt core that's close

2058
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,719
to rfc

2059
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,480
called video frame marking

2060
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,440
that goes over a lot of these points

2061
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,960
and uh what it basically does is it

2062
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,120
normalizes across all of the codecs not

2063
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,600
just the itu codex but also alternative

2064
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,560
codecs like vp8p98v1

2065
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,560
and it normalizes them into

2066
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,679
um

2067
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,000
a common format for describing

2068
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,640
the the dependencies and the

2069
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,280
the priority of of the temporal and

2070
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,560
spatial layers

2071
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,880
and so really all that's missing is

2072
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,040
in your draft you can instead of

2073
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,880
referencing every single codec you could

2074
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,440
reference an rtp header extension that

2075
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,600
carries that same information

2076
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,239
um the difference is that you're jumping

2077
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,760
all the way to

2078
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,480
mapping that directly to a dscp

2079
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,280
uh

2080
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,320
priority and that's a that's a step that

2081
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,120
um

2082
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,719
we've had a lot of argument about before

2083
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,800
about how to how to do that mapping and

2084
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,640
so i'd suggest you separate those two

2085
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,120
things one is identifying

2086
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,040
the the layers and the varieties of the

2087
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,719
layers very specifically and there's

2088
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,960
already rtb header extension to uh to

2089
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,400
surface that

2090
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,880
codec agnostically and then mapping that

2091
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,520
to a network priority is a separate

2092
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,880
problem that i think

2093
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,040
is probably better in like transport

2094
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,600
areas yeah thanks for pointing out draft

2095
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,560
yes i'm aware of that drafts and uh

2096
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,600
before

2097
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,560
of course after writing uh this

2098
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,880
particular draft yeah i will definitely

2099
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,840
refer to the draft or extension header

2100
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,080
you were mentioning about later for a

2101
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,159
later version okay next slide please

2102
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,760
um and

2103
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,239
in those drafts all mention the media

2104
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:53,040
aware network element so it is the

2105
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,239
element which is such as you know middle

2106
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,320
box or application layer gateway which

2107
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,640
is able to parsing those

2108
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,960
rtp packet payload headers and even rtp

2109
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,040
payload to reacting to

2110
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,880
to the network congestion

2111
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,920
um

2112
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,400
but due to the explicit layering in

2113
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,120
protocol stacked upper layer data and

2114
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,000
headers are transparent to network layer

2115
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,239
so the intermediate routers have no

2116
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,960
access to those information go to next

2117
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,280
slide

2118
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,760
even though we have the media where our

2119
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
nav nodes may be deployed in at ash or

2120
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,920
certain routers in the middle of the

2121
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,239
network but when network congestion

2122
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:41,920
happens for those routers do not have

2123
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,280
those you know media awareness

2124
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,159
you won't be able to react to

2125
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,560
to the network congestion properly to

2126
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,360
discard those less important packets

2127
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,120
so what we can do

2128
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,440
go to lexi

2129
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,600
we can actually um maybe using the

2130
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,080
dscp to indicate the importance of those

2131
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,199
packets

2132
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,080
um

2133
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,719
so the nri field has two bits tidbit

2134
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,639
field has three bits

2135
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:16,000
so scp value may be able to be mapped

2136
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,679
because you know uh

2137
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,400
as it has six bits maybe can be used to

2138
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,120
map according to either the

2139
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,080
iv value or tid value as well as the

2140
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,880
video types

2141
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,760
so the either the radio host or the

2142
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,719
source

2143
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,639
or the mae at the server domain edge can

2144
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,360
do the mapping and set up the dsp

2145
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,400
cp value for each rtp packet

2146
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,360
then the discarding precedence of those

2147
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,159
rtp packs can be determined when linked

2148
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:52,320
congestion happens go to the next slide

2149
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,280
so this is just you know print

2150
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,880
preliminary consideration how to map

2151
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,440
uh the dsc rtp

2152
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,560
how to map those mri values into dsp

2153
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,960
values according to

2154
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,840
the video types

2155
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,639
um and we will discuss those later um

2156
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,760
let's go to the next slide

2157
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,440
and also we have this kind of mapping

2158
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,679
for the tid value

2159
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,320
go to next slide

2160
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,040
oh cool well thank you uh kirsten for

2161
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,000
showing this slide for me uh so uh in

2162
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,960
the email list magnus mentioned

2163
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,360
list rfc

2164
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,639
7657 so if in general uh you know quoted

2165
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,560
from this draft marking packets with

2166
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,800
different dscps would result in

2167
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,760
different phps being applied at nodes

2168
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,719
may uh generate reordering issues

2169
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,120
however

2170
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,880
so in large draft it recommends to map a

2171
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,440
single network five tuples

2172
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,280
use phps from a to a single f class

2173
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,159
which means there is only three in each

2174
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,880
f class there is only three dropping

2175
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,000
precedence

2176
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,639
so it would not be possible to map to an

2177
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,159
ri or tid to a single f class

2178
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,239
you know one is four

2179
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:23,679
uh another is eight so single f class is

2180
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,000
only three um

2181
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,600
values and

2182
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,880
um on the other hand actually udp is not

2183
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,679
sensitive to or reordering the network

2184
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,360
so maybe

2185
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,000
we can use different dsap screws

2186
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,120
corresponding phps enables reordering

2187
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,400
within a single udp tuple

2188
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,800
so what i was thinking maybe you know

2189
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,199
instead of just mapped to a single f

2190
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,080
class we can map to multiple af class as

2191
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:52,880
i

2192
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,280
mentioned in the previous two slides go

2193
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,239
to next slide please

2194
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,639
and

2195
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,320
and another thing is about you know you

2196
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,040
have to um

2197
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,520
h.266 and h.265

2198
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,639
uh svc you have the pr id which is six

2199
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,679
bits which provides more granular

2200
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,159
priority information about lab packets

2201
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,880
and also you have

2202
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,159
h266 the layer id also is six bits um

2203
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,360
which again providing more discarding uh

2204
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,960
priority information so many

2205
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,080
many dhcp values are already being used

2206
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,560
and could be um available so are there

2207
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,440
any other ways to achieve this packet

2208
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,000
level dropping precedence within follow

2209
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,960
um maybe we need to consider other

2210
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,320
solutions

2211
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,199
um

2212
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,600
you know if discarding precedence as

2213
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,679
final granularity is considered to be

2214
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,120
supported

2215
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,600
okay um all right go to next slide

2216
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,000
please

2217
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,920
we got people in the queue do you want

2218
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,480
to take questions now

2219
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,520
oh uh

2220
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,199
yes yes

2221
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,040
okay all right so

2222
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,159
obviously uh this is maybe relevant to

2223
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:13,760
avt core however abt core is specified

2224
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,679
is you know a major scope is to specify

2225
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,159
and maintain payload formats for use

2226
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,440
with trtp may not consider

2227
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,639
how you know how to actually use those

2228
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,960
values in the network layer

2229
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,480
and um

2230
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,800
i think the most relevant maybe the

2231
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
transport air

2232
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,920
area and working group

2233
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,159
yeah let's all for my presentation i

2234
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,320
will take questions

2235
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,760
great thank you very much for your

2236
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,159
presentation and we do have folks in the

2237
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,159
queue please add yourself if you have

2238
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:50,638
you on the dispatch question so first up

2239
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,159
hi this is pete uh yeah it seems pretty

2240
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,600
straightforward that the people who can

2241
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,719
evaluate most of this are an avt core so

2242
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,480
i would suggest taking

2243
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,920
the document there as the dispatch for

2244
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,880
this

2245
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,280
and uh someone mentioned in the chat

2246
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,239
room that perhaps tsvwg could take on

2247
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,159
the dcsp bits

2248
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,320
um and i think that would be fine but

2249
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,719
avt core has the expertise to evaluate

2250
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,159
this so you might as well take it there

2251
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,400
in the first place right thank you for a

2252
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,080
suggestion yes

2253
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,000
thank you very much pete uh marcus

2254
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,040
westbrook

2255
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,360
yeah magnus westland here um

2256
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,400
i i think i think avt core is a good

2257
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,000
next steps and there maybe you can try

2258
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,840
to

2259
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,080
explain your use case for this and how

2260
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,679
it actually relates because if you have

2261
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:40,880
like the

2262
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,840
mains

2263
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,520
exist mostly in this type of different

2264
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,480
centralized conferencing etc

2265
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,960
if it's not iptv i wonder because

2266
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,199
there's as i wrote in the latest email

2267
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,880
there's multi-stream aspect of this

2268
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,080
which makes

2269
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,480
doing this across

2270
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,199
all the media streams blindly is

2271
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,159
unoptimized in many ways and

2272
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,000
lose you more calls than doing it in the

2273
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,960
media where an application aware way

2274
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,639
so i think there's a question saying

2275
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,239
what are you really trying to accomplish

2276
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:11,120
here

2277
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,040
what are you what do you actually need

2278
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,520
so but i think abd core is a reasonable

2279
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,600
place to discuss in this but it comes to

2280
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,320
rp and the usage and architectural

2281
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,760
question here yeah um so i mainly want

2282
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,480
to you know to

2283
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,600
use those bits in the network layer

2284
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,320
uh when our congestion happens just to

2285
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,639
randomly instead of randomly discarding

2286
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:35,760
packets

2287
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,719
it may

2288
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,600
you know now if the routers is able to

2289
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,760
know which packet is more important for

2290
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,719
decoding end to improve the user's end

2291
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,719
of quality

2292
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,280
or quality of experience maybe it's

2293
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,760
better to yeah

2294
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,600
what's yeah i still think you need to

2295
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,520
explain what application is in usage

2296
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,560
because

2297
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,120
to me it looks like in those application

2298
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,280
i know that uses rtp

2299
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,199
trying to do this in this way is

2300
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,000
probably sub-optimal

2301
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,600
so

2302
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,120
yeah all right okay thank you

2303
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,480
thank you

2304
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,960
um

2305
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,080
the uh

2306
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,840
if the goal is to um

2307
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,159
make sure that uh that delivery is

2308
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:27,760
optimal then i don't think you want to

2309
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,120
restrict your

2310
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,440
your focus to just dscps

2311
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,280
because what we found is that um

2312
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,320
layer two can also create a lot of

2313
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,159
problems um when it comes to

2314
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,560
prioritization so

2315
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,560
if you really want to

2316
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,040
look at the delivery to be optimized and

2317
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,480
what should be dropped you should also

2318
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,440
look at

2319
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,639
things like you know wi-fi

2320
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,840
upstream priorities and even in mobile

2321
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,080
networks you know look at the more

2322
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,480
complicated ways that rands can can also

2323
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,040
prioritize things so i don't think dscp

2324
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,320
is really going to

2325
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,320
give a lot of

2326
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,239
benefits to especially since it's

2327
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,360
usually not

2328
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,679
carried through interoperably across a

2329
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,400
large segment of the network um so if

2330
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,360
you really want to optimize the

2331
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,960
prioritization you need to look at all

2332
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,880
network layers and see where priority

2333
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,560
lives at all those layers and give some

2334
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,880
guidance at each layer yeah yeah thank

2335
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,760
you for commenting i agree like dscp may

2336
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,480
have remarking issues so it won't carry

2337
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,880
all the weight from end to end

2338
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,520
um yeah i will probably need to consider

2339
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,040
if there is other fields in the

2340
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,000
ip

2341
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,080
protocol which can carry this kind of

2342
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,560
information that could be leveraged by

2343
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,800
uh network nodes

2344
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,040
thank you

2345
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,600
thank you very much for questions

2346
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,159
hey there's um quite a bit of

2347
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:53,040
a saying

2348
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,239
tsv working group so if you could

2349
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:01,760
express your opinion on the dispatch

2350
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,840
question and those options as well that

2351
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,440
would be really helpful to people in the

2352
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,040
queue thank you it's mira

2353
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,280
yeah hi mia could have been i agree so

2354
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,600
the for the dispatch option um going to

2355
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,560
avt core or to um tcp wwg would be fine

2356
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,199
um if you go there i want to add to

2357
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,560
magnus comment that i think it's not

2358
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,080
only about the use case it's only about

2359
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,440
showing data that this is actually

2360
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,120
improvement because

2361
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,000
um usually the the video streaming is

2362
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,679
adaptive so like you shouldn't have long

2363
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,280
periods of congestion it's like a few

2364
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,760
packet loss that you try to optimize for

2365
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,120
not sure if you actually gain much

2366
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,639
performance by that

2367
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,040
yeah yeah i agree like for adaptive if

2368
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,280
the network congestion can be fed to

2369
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,199
information fat to the source it will

2370
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,159
cut down the rate yes and i'm talking

2371
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,840
about for like those short time period

2372
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,639
where congestion is not aware to the

2373
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,760
source if the network could optimize

2374
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,639
this kind of packet dropping

2375
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,120
yeah but like ideally that's really like

2376
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,040
a very short period of time just like a

2377
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,960
few packets and then there's also ecn

2378
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,639
you can use to avoid packet drop at all

2379
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,320
so i'm not sure that like this is the

2380
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,600
best solution

2381
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,320
yeah eason is also to reflect on our

2382
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,880
congestion yes

2383
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,280
okay thank you very much um next we have

2384
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,159
omir shapira

2385
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,159
hello i'm

2386
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,400
sorry i cannot hear you

2387
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,880
omar shapiro apple

2388
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,239
uh

2389
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,400
plus one to what uh

2390
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,639
what had been said before that uh the

2391
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,639
this pivots probably should belong to

2392
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,520
traffic but to transfer but

2393
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,239
additionally uh

2394
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:47,120
the concept of service classes is

2395
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:47,920
not

2396
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,560
limited to video

2397
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,719
other transport

2398
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,760
streams may benefit from that

2399
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,840
and

2400
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,639
additionally

2401
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,840
the notion that udp is not sensitive to

2402
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,560
reordering may be true for some

2403
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,120
protocols running on udp

2404
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,840
but

2405
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,520
i find it difficult to generalize for

2406
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,600
example quick maybe

2407
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,920
more uh sensitive to

2408
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,639
uh

2409
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,040
to reordering and the router may not

2410
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,840
know the difference between quick and

2411
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,239
rtb thank you yes thanks for coming i'm

2412
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,960
aware of those issues yeah

2413
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,840
thomas eckhart future way so to miriam's

2414
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,000
comment of whether this is uh you know

2415
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,440
important or not

2416
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,320
um there have been you know um good good

2417
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,880
results from the past shown that it

2418
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,320
obviously is

2419
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
valuable because the impact of losing

2420
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,639
even a single packet of

2421
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,560
a reference frame like an iframe in a

2422
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,199
video stream may cause a complete

2423
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,760
interruption blackout of a video stream

2424
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,440
for a whole

2425
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,440
group of pictures which for example in

2426
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,920
something like dish networks has been up

2427
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,000
to five seconds whereas

2428
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,159
a similar loss of a packet for a

2429
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:02,000
non-reference

2430
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
frame like a pre-frame just causes a

2431
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,719
blip that any good setup box can

2432
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,719
hide from you so

2433
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,040
there is a totally different degree of

2434
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,679
impact of even very short packet losses

2435
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,760
and you know even with ecn we've seen

2436
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,000
that we can't completely avoid any loss

2437
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,800
so i think you know managing that loss

2438
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,440
in this manner is a highly valuable

2439
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,199
thing to do especially the more you're

2440
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,239
getting into real-time and non-delay

2441
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,040
thanks taurus

2442
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:37,280
thank you very much and just to say that

2443
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,960
i'm hearing that it sounds like a lot of

2444
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,760
support from this abg core and tsb

2445
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,000
working group once the use case and

2446
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,719
performance gains have been clarified if

2447
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,320
you disagree with that summary please

2448
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
come up to the mic and express that if

2449
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,760
you agree then also please come up to

2450
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,679
the mic or put it on jabba and express

2451
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,480
that view next in the queue is jonathan

2452
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,920
lennox

2453
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,920
yes jonathan lennox um

2454
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,719
yeah

2455
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,800
to the dispatch point as an apt court

2456
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,159
chair i say this is i think this would

2457
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,480
be entirely in scope of abt car i mean

2458
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,040
again with the dsvwg doing the diffserv

2459
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:12,639
parts um to the use case point i think

2460
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:13,840
um

2461
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,560
it depends the um assumption the network

2462
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,480
assumptions you get for like set-top box

2463
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,920
streaming versus

2464
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,239
interactive video conferencing are quite

2465
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,199
different

2466
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,280
and i think that if you're looking at a

2467
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,120
set-top box streaming type use case i

2468
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,760
think this might be more i mean i think

2469
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,159
this might make more sense than um the

2470
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:33,920
interactive video conferencing types

2471
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,199
cases

2472
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,679
um where you do have um typically you

2473
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,040
have free transmissions and you have

2474
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,080
much more

2475
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,920
dynamic uh

2476
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,760
codec adjustments um so i'm not sure

2477
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,280
what somebody i guess that gets the

2478
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,360
point of what your use case is here

2479
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,239
thanks

2480
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,638
thank you

2481
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,880
okay thank you very much we have

2482
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,360
exhausted you so just to summarize

2483
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,239
um update those aspects and then take it

2484
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,199
to av

2485
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:06,320
and tsp working group for the dsp cpu

2486
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,080
and specific aspects

2487
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,239
um so that's the end of the

2488
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,719
part of the

2489
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,400
meeting at the moment so just to run

2490
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,840
through a summary of the dispatch

2491
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,000
outcomes which we will also email to the

2492
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,520
list and make sure the minutes fully

2493
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,560
reflect this and the bar a dispatch

2494
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,480
outcome there's a possible working group

2495
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,080
or discussion forum on this topic

2496
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,920
because it repeatedly comes up but not

2497
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,239
necessarily this exact proposal there is

2498
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,400
a consensus that it needs to be um more

2499
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,239
widely applicable and implemented more

2500
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,760
widely than only one um party therefore

2501
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,760
that outcome is to find more supporters

2502
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,600
and return with this proposal possibly

2503
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,159
others for working group scoping

2504
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,560
on bronze item transparently decrypting

2505
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,719
uris the outcome was that the work is

2506
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,639
worth doing there are more specifics

2507
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,000
that need detailing so it can be

2508
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,679
properly assessed and sent to the right

2509
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,280
place since we were hearing differences

2510
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,679
between s mime or http kind of

2511
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,000
similarities so come back with a draft

2512
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,360
work to progress

2513
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,960
on the web feeder reader dispatch

2514
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,960
outcome very simple create a non-working

2515
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,040
group mailing list on this topic

2516
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,119
for the uuid dispatch outcome there's

2517
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:10,880
some weak support for a working group

2518
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,679
performing a tightly focused or a longer

2519
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,000
term caretaker for uuids and maintenance

2520
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,920
of the drafts and so that will go to the

2521
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,920
dispatch mailing list to find volunteers

2522
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,400
to form a charter and flesh out which of

2523
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,560
those two options it would be and then

2524
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,719
finally discarding priority of rtp video

2525
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,199
packets the dispatch outcome was the use

2526
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,800
case needs clarifying gains and

2527
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,280
performance need clearly demonstrating

2528
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,960
and then once those aspects have been

2529
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,440
updated to take it to abt core and tsp

2530
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,760
working group which for the dscp

2531
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,000
specific aspects

2532
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,880
so that's a rundown of our um dispatch

2533
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,560
session today thanks to everyone who

2534

grateful for you bringing your time and

2537
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,440
effort to us and at this point we'll

2538
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,159
shift into the art area portion of the

2539
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,600
meeting

2540
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600

01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,840
newborn to all share with you but that

2550
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,920
has probably not happened yet

2551
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,600
um

2552
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,840

bar uh

2561
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,520

slide please

2572
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,560
uh errata

2573
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,239
people in this room may or may not know

2574
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,719
about errata it is a service a record

2575
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,480
keeping service provided by the rfc

2576
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,280
editor about documents that have already

2577
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,960
been published but they need to have

2578
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,880
some kind of correction made to them or

2579
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,040
on the record so that people know there

2580
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,119
are corrections that have been recorded

2581
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:26,480
that you might need to know if you're

2582
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,880
implementing this specification

2583
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,040
they can be also folded in later on if

2584
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,440
there's an update document done for uh

2585
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,719
like a best document that you've seen

2586
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:35,840
coming through they're used for

2587
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,760
editorial mistakes and

2588
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,600
if the document as published did not

2589
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,280
correctly capture the consensus of the

2590
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,199
working group you don't use a naradam

2591
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:44,639
for saying i think it should be

2592
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,080
something else

2593
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,760
we will reject those

2594
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,239
uh next please

2595
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,960
these have historically uh the

2596
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,040
atom once processed is either rejected

2597
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,280
because it's wrong or improperly used

2598
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,040
it's verified meaning we've confirmed

2599
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,639
that this is true this should be

2600
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:03,040
properly recorded and possibly processed

2601
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,920
later the third state is hfdu which sean

2602
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,520
turner says hold for the death of the

2603
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,119
universe but it's

2604
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,639
hold for document update wait for the

2605
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,000
next version before you actually do any

2606
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,800
something with it um these are often

2607
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,719
left neglected and not actually

2608
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,080
processed what you see here is the

2609
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,159
number of unprocessed in each of the

2610
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,639
three areas for art and its previous

2611
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,400
versions are

2612
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,280
apps and rye so we have a large body of

2613
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,480
work that hasn't been looked at yet

2614
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,080
this is just historically something that

2615
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,600
we haven't paid much attention to but

2616
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,440
they do need to get processed uh sooner

2617
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,719
or later so

2618
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,800
some of these art ones are for current

2619
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,960
working groups and so you can actually

2620
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,480
go and see if there's something here you

2621
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,159
could help us process as working group

2622
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,000
chairs or document authors and see you

2623
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,520
may have been notified that there's one

2624
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,840
filed against one of your documents

2625
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,920
i'll be starting to process these slowly

2626
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,400
myself as much as i can we can't rely on

2627
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,600
the current working groups to worry

2628
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,199
about errata from working groups that

2629
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,440
are gone or documents that were

2630
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,280
sponsored by ads and had no working

2631
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,560
groups but

2632
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,159
anybody who has

2633
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,840
in a working group

2634
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,600
where you could help us start processing

2635
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,119
some of these on your own it would be

2636
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:10,400
great working group chairs if you have

2637
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,960
the bandwidth to do that

2638
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,320
um

2639
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,159
next slide please

2640
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,119
any questions on errata before i go on

2641
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,800
okay i didn't think there would be too

2642
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,159
much of that um this is the usual call

2643
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,320
for help for various roles within the

2644
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,800
ietf and within the art area

2645
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,719
we need more volunteers to do the work

2646
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,600
that is that is uh the work of the area

2647
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,440
um it's not always working group chairs

2648
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,719
although that's the common thing that

2649
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,119
we're asking for but um you know if you

2650
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,199
want to be involved in reviewing uh

2651
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:44,080
requests from ayanna registries of media

2652
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,199
types is the big favorite one um

2653
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,360
uh ned fried is no longer with us he was

2654
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,600
the champion of that one for many many

2655
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,600
years uh there's we're down to two

2656
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,960
people one of them is me and i'm not

2657
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,239
supposed to be doing them while i'm an

2658
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:57,840
area director so it would be great to

2659
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,159

uh the art area review team i just

2691
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,960
mentioned uh this is an extremely useful

2692
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,199
to the area directors uh team of

2693
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,280
reviewers that look at documents mostly

2694
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,239
coming from other areas that are um that

2695
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:12,239
may have aspects that touch art and

2696
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,560
should get proper consideration i don't

2697
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,719
remember the size of the current pool of

2698
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:19,440
reviewers it's you can find it online

2699

they do they've done 28 reviews for us

2700
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,760
in the last three months about 91 total

2701
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,679
in the last year

2702
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,360
i looked to see if i could see credit

2703
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,800
one person with having done way more

2704
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,400
than everybody else but it is a pretty

2705
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,480
fairly even distribution everybody's

2706
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,040
done maybe three to four this year

2707

um thank you to those people who provide

2708
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,600
that service it is very helpful to us at

2709
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,360
during document reviews

2710
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:44,400
to have an extra perspective

2711
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,199
and if you're interested in

2712
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,119
participating in this

2713
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,040

2720
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,679
this is barry lieber

2721
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:11,679
well i guess i wanted to say something

2722
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,320
murray said about the previous

2723
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,719
slide also actually could you

2724
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,800
kirsty can you go back this one

2725
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,119
it was

2726
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,760
oh yes volunteering as a working group

2727
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,000
chair when i was an ad i was looking for

2728
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,520
the same thing of course

2729
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,600
and what i want to stress is that even

2730
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,719
if

2731
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,159
it's not necessarily that there's a

2732
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,840
particular working group that needs a

2733
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,080
chair right now that you can volunteer

2734
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,760
for although that but also just let

2735
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,440
murray and and

2736
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,280
francesca or whatever your area

2737
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,000
directors are um that that you'd like to

2738
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,679
be considered as a working group chair

2739
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,840
in the future when the need arises

2740
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,920
because we're always looking for a pool

2741
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,000
of people to call on

2742
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,920
who might be new chairs who might not

2743
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,440
have chaired for a while and that sort

2744
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,320
of thing

2745
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,119
and then back to the art art thing

2746
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,719
what i try to do is

2747
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:04,320
do a little

2748
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,880
i look at the documents quickly first

2749
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,400
and assign only ones that um

2750
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,000
that look like they would benefit

2751
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,159
particularly from an art area review so

2752
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,639
unlike security directorate for instance

2753
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,560
that tries to review every document

2754
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,480
going through there are a lot of

2755
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,000
documents that

2756
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,280
in in internet area routing area in uh

2757
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,600
with yang models and stuff like that

2758
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,199
that i decide we don't really need an

2759
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,199
art review of

2760
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,360
so it's it's a pretty

2761
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,960
low effort

2762
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,280
thing it you just get a review assigned

2763
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,080
to you

2764
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,560
infrequently and then it's pretty easy

2765
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,040
so please let me know if you are not

2766
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,560
already on the list and you would like

2767
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,520
to be

2768
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,600
um and the ads would really appreciate

2769
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,119
the extra help

2770
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,759
we definitely do

2771
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,080
and last slide i think is just to catch

2772
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,600
up on uh

2773
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,800
we have um folded the internet excuse me

2774
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,239
the internationalization directorate

2775
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,440
into the art area that was announced

2776
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,840
about 10 days ago i think

2777
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,600
the current reviews the

2778
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,679
i18 ender used to conduct

2779
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,600
internationalization framework reviews

2780
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,080
for documents that need them eai unicode

2781
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:17,199
and so forth um the current chair of

2782
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,520
the 18 i18n directorate needs to move on

2783
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,119
to other duties so we have folded them

2784
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,360
in that has happened just in case anyone

2785
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,719
missed the announcement

2786
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,400
um

2787
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,480
there is a breakfast for the art art

2788
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,080
team which now includes both

2789
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,000
organizations wednesday morning it's in

2790
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,800
the agenda if you haven't seen that

2791
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:35,840
we'll try to get some remote

2792
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,280
participation because i think actually

2793
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,040
almost none of the internationalization

2794
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,520
people could make it this time but we'll

2795
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,199
at least set up a laptop in the corner

2796
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,040
or something like that so that they can

2797
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,560
say hello and participate in any

2798
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,960
conversation

2799
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,080
uh any questions for for your solo ad

2800
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,480
this time

2801
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,159
i could do an open mic before the

2802
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,480
plenary

2803
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,119

2820
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,360
uh the problem we're facing is that uh

2821
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,760
you know ietf has been working for

2822
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,560
decades on interoperability for voice

2823
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,480
and video communication

2824
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,119
uh between different providers this has

2825
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,119
been pretty successful

2826
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,520
in some areas but has totally failed

2827
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,880
when it comes to app to app

2828
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,560
interoperability meaning like can you

2829
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,520
make a

2830
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,480
video call between say skype and

2831
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,480
facetime you cannot can you send

2832
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,040
messaging from wire

2833
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:09,360
to signal no right no can't do that um

2834
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,960
what's app to webex call no no

2835
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,199
so none of that works um

2836
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,119
and that's mostly for

2837
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,600
business commercial reasons

2838
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,920
uh there's a recently a new ray of hope

2839
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:24,480
that such a thing might someday happen

2840
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,400
due to some european regulation called

2841
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,880
the digital markets act that recently

2842
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,800
is passed or getting passed or something

2843
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,960
of that sort and so in response largely

2844
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,199
to that a bunch of folks i know rowan

2845
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,639
wrote some documents and i wrote this

2846
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:38,159
document called spin

2847
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:39,840
that's poking at different things that

2848
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,600
need to happen to provide a modern

2849
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,880
solution for

2850
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,320
voice video and messaging

2851
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,560
interoperability between say uh

2852
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,080
you know facetime and a skype or

2853
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,360
whatever so

2854
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,280
that's the topic of the spin draft there

2855
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,480
seems to be quite a bit of interest on

2856
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,159
the list we're obviously not going to

2857
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,080
discuss that here in dispatch but there

2858
