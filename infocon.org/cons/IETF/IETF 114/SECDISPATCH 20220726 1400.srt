1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,660
thank you

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,380
um

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,440
thank you

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,920
and then I don't have slides oh because

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,879
he sent them to me

6
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
foreign

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,680
[Music]

8
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,759
thank you

9
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,380
okay so that's fixed

10
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,158
did you see them

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,800
foreign

12
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,300
[Music]

13
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,140
I could see that I am visible in the

14
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,000
room

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
Richard

16
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,620
I assume I am audible as well

17
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,540
uh good morning Richard we're just

18
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,459
getting the com set up here so stand by

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,860
foreign

20
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,980
okay so I need to close out of this

21
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,340
yeah

22
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,900
so it didn't pop up after a

23
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,620
first probably

24
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,519
right here

25
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,160
though

26
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,680
so you could use share slides ah so then

27
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,540
I can yeah so if you display from there

28
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,500
now that you uploaded it

29
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,139
you jack being shared

30
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,540
you're ready to rock and roll great all

31
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,520
right sorry for a couple minute delay

32
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
there good morning

33
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,740
welcome to SEC dispatch if you had

34
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,720
intended to be in a different room

35
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,479
you can go find that now and we'll get

36
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,460
rolling

37
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,580
um

38
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,280
let's see if I can advance the slides

39
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm not seeing them on my screen

40
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,860
okay now I do

41
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,380
great so here's the note well please

42
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,880
take note of the note well

43
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,860
and Richard Barnes is remote as my

44
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,080
co-chair he'll be helping with a few a

45
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,820
few very important functions like

46
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,039
helping to keep this on track in the the

47
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,259
summary outcomes

48
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,440
and anything else I miss so let's see

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,860
meeting tips in person participation so

50
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,900
from the working group chairs yesterday

51
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,940
there's an emphasis on make sure you're

52
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,220
wearing your mask in the room

53
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,800
if you're up at that mic you also wear a

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,419
mask the only time you don't need to

55
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,340
wear a mask if it is if you are the

56
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,500
presenter

57
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,380
um please use the meat Echo to join them

58
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,479
IQ

59
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,400
even if you're in the room so that we

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,620
can keep things fair in between remote

61
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,120
and local participants

62
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,699
and

63
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,780
let's see code of conduct

64
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,060
make sure you uh

65
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,180
respect your colleagues and

66
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
um

67
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
move on I hope people know this by now

68
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,020
so now the SEC dispatch process

69
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,960
SEC dispatch is here to recommend next

70
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,060
step for work as an aide to the area

71
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,699
directors in terms of how documents get

72
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,280
Shepherd shepherded on

73
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,740
um you know they have several possible

74
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,520
outcomes and this meeting is to help

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,280
steer those outcomes

76
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
um by each of you reviewing the

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,940
documents and providing feedback

78
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,919
listening to the presentations and

79
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,780
helping to determine the possible

80
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,599
Direction so it could be that we direct

81
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,460
it to an existing working group if

82
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,099
that's possible that's ideal

83
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,800
propose a new focused working group if

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,259
it's a small body of work and there

85
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,759
there could be a recommendation for a

86
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,400
mailing list or a buff

87
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,099
A.D sponsorship if it's an individual

88
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,580
draft and doesn't have the need for a

89
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,960
larger format

90
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
it might be that the draft requires

91
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
additional discussion and so that's a

92
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,319
possibility and there could be a mailing

93
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,419
list just for that or continuing on the

94
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,160
SEC dispatch list

95
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,740
and then also that the ietf may not work

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,319
on some something as the outcome

97
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,840
all right great so we will go through

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,360
each of the three items submitted today

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,580
each have 15 minutes including

100
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,979
discussion so 10 minutes to present five

101
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,840
minutes for discussion

102
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,080
and with that we can begin with the

103
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,259
terminology for post Quantum hybrids and

104
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,879
I'll get those slides up Richard did I

105
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,440
miss anything are we good

106
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,099
I have one last thing for our uh chair

107
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,960
session here which is that we're having

108
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,900
a bit of change in leadership

109
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,780
um so Mohit has um resigned his chair um

110
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,180
to uh take advantage of some other

111
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,800
opportunities

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
um I just wanted to take a minute here

113
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,840
to thank Rohit for his service here

114
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,699
Round of Applause for Mohit and thanks

115
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,620
for his his work

116
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,319
um as our as our second dispatch coach

117
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,060
here so thanks to God

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,399
yes thank you thank you Richard

119
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,539
yeah

120
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,458
all right great so we have flow

121
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,640
hi everyone

122
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,160
um I'm Floyd Driscoll and I'm here to

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,380
propose this draft on terminology post

124
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,019
Quantum traditional hybrid schemes

125
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,180
um so next slide please

126
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,000
um so the background to this is as I

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
suspect most people in this room know

128
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,160
um given the development of a

129
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,440
sufficiently large quantum computer a

130
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,459
lot of the algorithms well the

131
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,899
algorithms that we use for asymmetric

132
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,940
cryptography at the moment

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,380
um will be vulnerable to the quantum

134
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,580
computer

135
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,140
um now it's kind of it's important to

136
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,459
mention that we don't actually know that

137
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,019
such a computer is ever going to exist

138
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,200
but we have to act as if it will

139
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,180
um and there were quite a number of

140
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,100
presentations yesterday about the kind

141
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,839
of the transition of algorithms the

142
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,279
algorithms that missed are going

143
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,560
standardize

144
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,480
um but this presentation is more about

145
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,420
the transition so the development of ITF

146
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,940
protocols or the modification of ITF

147
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,740
protocols

148
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,360
um to permit the use of post Quantum

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,060
asymmetric algorithms

150
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,160
so during the algorithm transition

151
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,560
period there might be a desire or there

152
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,480
is a desire for protocols which use both

153
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,580
post Quantum and traditional algorithms

154
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,040
so so-called hybrids

155
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,200
um although so unsurprisingly there's a

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
terminology draft so that's under

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,100
discussion

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,959
um there's already a lot of ongoing work

159
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,120
to standardize these constructions

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,100
um but well both ongoing and completed

161
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,720
work in lamps in ipsec in TLS

162
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,480
um and drafts on terminologies have been

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,980
drafts on terminology have been

164
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,899
suggested a few times

165
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,940
um but specifically at the lamps interim

166
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,279
in April it was discussed

167
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,420
so next slide please

168
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,779
cool so why do we need to talk about

169
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,519
terminology

170
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,260
there's actually quite a few reasons for

171
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,339
this

172
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,959
um and I've tried to separate into some

173
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,519
bullet points but I suspect people can

174
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,320
come up with more

175
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,360
so the first is we're using a lot of

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,820
different words in different places so

177
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,740
you see the word hybrid you see dual

178
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,560
multi-key multi-algorithm composite

179
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,839
non-composite sometimes we're using

180
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,700
these as synonyms and sometimes we're

181
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,260
using them to mean subtly different

182
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
things like one will be a subset of

183
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,200
another

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
and it actually varies from draft to

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,079
draft how these words are being used so

186
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
it would be really useful if we could

187
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
decide on a set of words and then use

188
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,100
them consistently that's both nice it

189
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,779
makes it easier to read drafts but it's

190
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,940
also security critical because it allows

191
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,040
us to discuss

192
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,640
um

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
so we're not not described discuss

194
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,240
things across purposes so that makes

195
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,860
analysis easier it makes comparison

196
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,959
easier

197
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,899
before I go on I forgot to check if we

198
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,399
have minute takers

199
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,700
so can we get a volunteer I know we have

200
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,060
Richard noting the outcomes but uh more

201
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,500
detailed minutes would be nice

202
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,120
I believe Carson born on his mom's here

203
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,959
oh great thank you

204
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,180
um Olsen

205
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,820
um so secondly there's multiple types of

206
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,800
hybrid constructions

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,260
um so the the big difference that's been

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,760
discussed in lamps quite a lot is the

209
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,899
difference between composite and

210
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,600
non-composite constructions it would be

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,980
really useful to have a reference for

212
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,139
what we mean by this

213
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,639
um and there's probably other things I

214
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,380
haven't thought of there

215
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,880
thirdly

216
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,200
um if we're talking about functionality

217
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,579
oh sorry

218
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,480
um

219
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,459
different hybrid schemes aim to achieve

220
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,139
different properties

221
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,300
some of these have

222
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,920
kind of I guess come

223
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,139
equivalent elsewhere in cryptography so

224
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,459
things like backwards compatibility

225
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,820
crypto agility but others don't so

226
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,440
hybrid confidentiality hybrid

227
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
authentication I'm not actually 100 sure

228
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
what we mean by hybrid authentication so

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,820
probably good to discuss it

230
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,459
um again like with sort of the earlier

231
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,959
point it would be good to have a

232
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,579
reference for these it makes analysis

233
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,639
easier it makes comparison easier

234
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,320
um and thirdly

235
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,060
the word hybrid is you already used in

236
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,740
cryptography to mean a combination of

237
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,720
symmetric and asymmetric

238
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
um algorithms

239
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,519
um so for an EG and hpke

240
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,380
doesn't matter that we're overloading

241
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,480
the word hybrid some people think it

242
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,639
does some people think it doesn't

243
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,160
it comes up quite a lot it would be good

244
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,980
to decide and then move forward

245
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,560
in the next slide please

246
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,380
uh so the proposal is an informational

247
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,720
draft to standardize a glossary for post

248
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
Quantum traditional hybrids everything's

249
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,220
up to for discussion so that's the

250
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,899
phrasing I'm using at the minute but

251
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,820
that can change

252
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,740
uh the aim is to ensure consistency

253
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,540
across different protocols different

254
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,160
standards and hopefully different

255
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
organizations

256
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,320
um

257
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,220
next slide please

258
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,620
why we need this is I suppose basically

259
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,720
what I discussed two slides ago

260
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
um

261
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
it's to make it clear what security

262
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
properties a particular hybrid

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,500
construction claims and then to be able

264
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
to assess if it's achieving those

265
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,220
security properties

266
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,260
it's to enable easier comparisons and

267
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,760
solutions that's both within working

268
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,860
groups but also across working groups

269
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
because it would be really useful to be

270
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,820
able to pull our knowledge and to

271
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,680
transfer solutions that work from one

272
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,180
setting to another where that's

273
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,740
appropriate

274
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,839
and then finally it's to settle language

275
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,540
discussions and kind of pull all the

276
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,279
language conversations to this draft

277
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,500
and allow the kind of construction and

278
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,839
the writing of new protocols to happen

279
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,940
there without discussing how much we

280
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,320
like the word hybrid

281
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,339
next slide please

282
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,199
um so

283
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
I suppose I'm very happy to answer

284
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
questions about the reasons for the

285
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,339
draft

286
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,560
um but hopefully there's people who

287
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,420
agree that this is valuable um and would

288
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,220
like to work on it

289
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,779
um so I brought to set dispatch because

290
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,480
I wasn't really sure where it belonged

291
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,260
um

292
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,360
I think on the list there's been

293
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,220
discussion of the idea of some sort of

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,680
new group for post Quantum migration if

295
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,360
such a group existed this would fit

296
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
really well there but it relies on the

297
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,240
group existing

298
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,839
otherwise cfrg might make sense this is

299
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,480
really more about the protocols and the

300
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,339
kind of the engineering part than the

301
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,339
algorithms so I don't know how that fits

302
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,139
lots of work like this has happened in

303
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,240
lamps but again it's not just about

304
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,699
certificates

305
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,399
um or maybe I don't really know how ad

306
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,440
sponsorship works but maybe it fits

307
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,300
there but I'll leave that to this room

308
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,019
to decide

309
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
um and that's basically everything I had

310
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,519
to say

311
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,720
um

312
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,120
if this is dispatched really really Keen

313
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,040
to work with people on it discuss it

314
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,620
with people make any changes that kind

315
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,019
of the ITF wants this is essentially

316
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,519
useless if it's just me writing down a

317
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,139
list of words

318
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,180
um but if we can kind of all agree then

319
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,759
I think it could help us move forwards

320
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,380
um that next slide has a link to the

321
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,060
draft on it whatever slide people want

322
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
up is good cool so yeah any questions or

323
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,880
discussion great so Paul Hoffman is

324
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,740
first up in the queue

325
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,139
Paul Hoffman um I'm concerned about a

326
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,360
single draft that is uh doing the

327
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,120
terminology both for key exchange and

328
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
for signatures

329
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,139
um I think it's it would be nice if we

330
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,519
could pull them all together I think

331
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,259
that that's going to be very challenging

332
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,199
for you and we need to have hybrids for

333
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,620
both but I think trying to do them all

334
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,199
at once and as you've seen with hpke and

335
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,759
such I think you're going to have a

336
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,940
terminology mismatch

337
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,980
um there so I'm just suggesting to make

338
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,500
your life easier do key exchange first

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,880
wait on the signatures

340
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,360
foreign

341
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,120
yeah that's a that's a very reasonable

342
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,019
Point

343
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,139
um at the moment there's yeah signatures

344
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,540
are more difficult than key exchange

345
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,380
um

346
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,899
yeah that's a reasonable Point all right

347
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,040
yeah

348
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,880
um

349
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,620
preliminary question do you know how

350
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,940
much the research Community is

351
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,680
converging on terminology here

352
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,160
um I think in the research community

353
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,939
there's

354
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,740
so I've not read something which kind of

355
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,780
defined this is how it's going to work

356
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,579
everywhere Jenna for example NIS just

357
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,199
Define it in their FAQs how they're

358
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,140
going to use hybrids um terminology I

359
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,179
think there are two differences between

360
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,640
the ITF and the research Community one

361
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,439
is this is the only place I've heard

362
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,480
there be concerns about the use of the

363
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,339
word hybrid at all

364
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,900
um so elsewhere people just sort of use

365
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,640
it and assume that it's going to be

366
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,740
understood what it means in context and

367
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,059
the second is that there is language

368
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,360
here which is specific to kind of IDF

369
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,400
protocol development so in the protocol

370
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,679
space rather than the algorithm space

371
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
I mean I guess so where I was going with

372
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,919
that is I prefer not to see us develop a

373
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,539
duplicate terminology to what the

374
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,980
academic Community is using that seems

375
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,360
like very confusing

376
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,860
um so the sense of which we can hoist

377
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,179
theirs the better

378
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,860
um if we can't then that's unfortunate I

379
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,059
suppose

380
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,400
um that suggests to me um to going

381
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,780
through these examples

382
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,000
um I think it is much is a bad choice

383
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,460
um because if the intention is that um

384
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,620
people we're going to ask everybody uses

385
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,240
internology then these projects just

386
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,620
doesn't get the kind of review quite

387
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,299
across you know cutting review and

388
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,799
agreement that we want

389
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,360
um I think that was kind of frankly I

390
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,100
understand how the glossary happened but

391
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,760
like I think it's kind of an

392
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,799
anti-pattern um

393
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,539
um I think so

394
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,840
on my sense given sort of my bias

395
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,760
towards agreeing with the academic

396
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,559
Community but it is in cr4g which is our

397
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,419
best relationship with them

398
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,000
um um I don't think um you know I guess

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,679
if we had a new PQ group that might be

400
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,960
okay but we don't um out of things again

401
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,100
doesn't get the kind of cross-cutting

402
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,960
review that you'd need for that so I

403
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,460
think I always say either a new group or

404
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,200
cfrg

405
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,059
um

406
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,940
and I'm sure you'll you'll um I do I do

407
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,500
generally approve of creating one form

408
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,059
one attractive nuisance to gather all

409
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,140
the discussions about terminology and

410
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,120
it's a good choice

411
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,780
foreign

412
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,140
just said I've worked in some groups in

413
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,880
ISO that were doing terminology

414
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,120
documents and uh they can take years

415
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,760
they we we've had two-hour conference

416
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,039
calls on uh what the meaning of the term

417
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,160
node and in the two hours we did not

418
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,020
come to consensus on what the definition

419
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,660
was so it's a mess and it's definitely

420
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,200
not an ad sponsorship thing

421
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,419
um I think I agree with Ecker that a new

422
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,360
working group would probably be good

423
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,580
partly because I think that after you do

424
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,260
this you may find you want to do other

425
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,600
terminology stuff for the security area

426
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,580
and then you'll have a working group

427
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,460
ready to go there

428
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,840
okay Richard Barnes

429
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,799
questions

430
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,960
all right so we'll go back to Richard

431
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,720
maybe Sophia

432
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,179
yes

433
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,039
sorry uh Sophia Philly from Brave uh

434
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,620
please uh thank you very much for doing

435
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,780
this it's really it's really great

436
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,100
um the second thing

437
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,539
um maybe addressing a little bit about

438
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,760
the research community that I'm from uh

439
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,380
there's not much enough unification

440
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,900
actually of terminology it there is some

441
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,940
for the key exchange part but mostly

442
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,159
because of the standards from nist and

443
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,740
also from the federal documents uh from

444
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,500
this and maybe just addressed and also

445
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,740
to kind of um support of what Paul was

446
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,200
saying indeed it will be really valuable

447
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
to have two different documents one for

448
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,460
the key exchange processes and one for

449
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,200
the authentication as last signature

450
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,179
process because indeed it's a little bit

451
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,460
more complicated the terminology or

452
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,039
those two terminologies are dependent on

453
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,140
whatever value they are giving so that

454
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,120
would be great to have it specifically

455
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,220
too um if you want a little bit of a

456
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,500
unified terminology for the hybrid

457
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,900
signatures what this recommends is to

458
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,120
use dual but we can take that indeed for

459
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,340
the list and I support this indeed is

460
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,440
far more from the research area of the

461
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,900
iitm maybe cfrg but I would like also

462
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,419
that maybe uh post Quantum A specific

463
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,179
group might be created and thank you

464
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,100
very much

465
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,860
thank you Daniel uh Daniel Khan Gilmore

466
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,260
ACLU uh so thanks for bringing this work

467
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,960
uh I want to Second pretty much what

468
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,159
other people seem to be saying which is

469
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,600
that a new group is probably the best

470
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,900
bet cfrg is really uh getting congested

471
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,360
right now and I'm I mean I guess the

472
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
cfrg chairs could speak to this but I

473
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,380
wouldn't want to load more on them

474
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,400
especially something that might be

475
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,100
contentious about terminology and I I

476
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,419
want to Second the idea that you need

477
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:55,980
different drafts for signatures and

478
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,720
encryption not just because of the

479
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,220
technological difference but because the

480
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,679
actual use cases are quite different

481
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,600
um so separating them up means that if

482
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,980
one of them turns out to be easier to

483
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,080
solve than the other you're not blocking

484
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,280
thanks and tkg

485
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,400
while you're there um so folks think uh

486
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,799
a new working group would be handy

487
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,840
um I I think one of the questions here

488
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,360
is uh as the speaker raises whether

489
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,880
there's other uh post Quantum migration

490
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,020
issues that would go in this working

491
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,120
group or whether you think a terminology

492
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,340
draft would be a sufficient Charter to

493
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,679
get a new working group spun up

494
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,539
I think it would be a sufficient Charter

495
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,860
but you know with the experience with

496
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,919
curdle I I could imagine something

497
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,600
curdle-ish happening once the

498
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,340
terminology is pretty clear like how do

499
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,720
we how do we work this into different

500
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,020
spaces uh across iitf

501
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,200
foreign

502
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,960
Baker yeah I think another group is uh

503
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,140
probably best simply because the way

504
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,880
that I would expect that uh a lot of

505
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,340
this work is going to go is people who

506
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,780
are building stuff are going to come

507
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,419
along and say what do I call it you know

508
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,299
what terminology do I use and

509
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,960
yes cfrg does algorithm stuff but

510
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
algorithms and pro and cryptographic

511
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,200
Protocols are not the same thing as wire

512
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,080
protocols cryptographic wire Protocols

513
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,659
are not cryptographic protocols they're

514
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,460
slightly different and when you're

515
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,740
trying to discuss things you know that's

516
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,539
going to be the point where we need uh

517
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,900
to understand the terminology

518
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,799
all right thank you so do the ads want

519
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,059
to add anything there's quite a bit of

520
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,980
discussion it seems like some sort of

521
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,220
group is being recommended cfrg has been

522
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,340
tossed out there the chair said yes in

523
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,260
the chat other people are saying it's

524
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,059
not the right place

525
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,059
uh so let me do take my ad prerogative

526
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,520
uh before I talk about ad kind of wrap

527
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
up so the first I like the uh there's a

528
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,940
lot of energy around kind of post

529
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,580
Quantum I personally uh Edie hat off

530
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,200
would love for us to be able to talk

531
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,179
about it in a consistent way so the

532
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,740
appeal of having a terminology graphic

533
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,360
kind of is exciting for me all right

534
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,039
break uh Ed ad hat on uh I think we need

535
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,140
to talk we'll talk with cfrg and I think

536
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,120
we need to have a community conversation

537
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,980
about what would be the energy around

538
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,960
this other post Quantum working group

539
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
we've had a few kind of proposals the

540
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,720
Gap has been we want more work in it the

541
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,700
new piece that I'm hearing here is maybe

542
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,340
just talking about like terminology is a

543
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,380
sufficient start to that we would need

544
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,900
to test that more broadly broadly kind

545
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,640
of in the community so I think the

546
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
dispatch is I think we need to talk a

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,460
little bit more about where to land this

548
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,320
but we are committed to finding a place

549
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,400
to land this

550
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,320
thank you

551
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,679
uh Roman if I could just uh an

552
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,820
additional level of detail there it

553
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,740
sounds like uh what we've gotten out of

554
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,419
discussion here is that the The Landing

555
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,200
place

556
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,820
yeah we're gonna have a discussion about

557
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,960
where this should land but it seems like

558
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,340
the landing place is either somewhere

559
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,640
close to cfrg and cfrg or in a in a new

560
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,140
dedicated group here does that sound

561
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,880
like what you're hearing

562
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,740
yeah I think that's exactly right and I

563
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,240
think there's some feedback to unpack

564
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,740
around

565
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,900
splitting this focusing this and the

566
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
rest of it but I I would uh what I hear

567
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,080
is since it was spread all over the

568
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,580
place about how you should do that and

569
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,080
you've got conflicting advice wherever

570
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,220
it lands would be the place to

571
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,799
adjudicate that

572
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,200
thanks

573
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,159
very much everybody

574
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,620
all right thank you so we'll have our

575
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,480
next

576
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,520
speaker

577
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,720
to get the slides

578
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,799
looks like we have uh Stefan yes hello

579
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,720
I'm on the remote

580
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,860
second billions really yeah

581
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,980
so hello everyone I'm Stephanie and I am

582
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,260
president in the draft celebrated till

583
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,740
that's authentication next slide please

584
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:06,559
yeah so that is and tell us this uh

585
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,440
notification based on mutual feelings it

586
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,140
provides a seclusion which cannot be

587
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
broken between client and server to not

588
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,880
entirely rely on on web pki we locked

589
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,980
the PS authentication keys by pinning

590
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,960
information about the entities in the

591
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Federation are published in the

592
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,179
Federation metadata document this is

593
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,000
assigned Json which claims describing

594
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,900
the entities and points

595
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,840
to enable self-signed certificate it's

596
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,779
possible to publish trust Anchorage

597
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,200
issues for this in the metadata

598
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
the metadata is also used for service

599
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,740
Discovery based on claims such as

600
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,860
organization and tags organizations are

601
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,779
vet by the Federation when they apply

602
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,820
for membership by trusting the

603
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,580
Federation and the metadata members

604
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,059
trust the authenticity of other members

605
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,379
next slide please

606
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,419
background for this is I work for the

607
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,340
switch in the foundation that is an

608
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,860
independent Foundation that works for

609
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,279
the positive development of the internet

610
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,360
we are responsible for the CC top level

611
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,340
domain.sn.nu the profit from from

612
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,240
selling domains finances among other

613
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,320
things

614
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,539
running federations for the school

615
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,620
sector and health sector in Sweden in

616
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,940
the Federation for the school sector

617
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,039
there was a great need to be able to

618
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,799
translate the secure using Open

619
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,340
Standards that was where the idea of fed

620
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
TLS was born

621
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,020
one stakeholder is the Swedish national

622
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,159
Agency for Education which will use fed

623
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,500
Telus for

624
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,299
user life cycle management for the

625
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,840
digital National tests

626
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,220
today there is a steady increase if

627
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,840
remember both schools and service

628
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,260
providers they understand our delivering

629
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,200
identity and access Management Solutions

630
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,080
for federations has also started to

631
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
implement the TLs

632
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,820
uh I think we would probably see a more

633
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,980
rapid acceptance if the specification

634
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,740
was stable

635
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,240
today as far as I know there are three

636
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,059
open source implementations and the

637
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,860
first one is a client and the other two

638
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,919
are servers

639
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,340
next slide please

640
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,159
so how does all this works and um

641
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,279
a client and server exchanges submitted

642
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,980
data with the Federation and decline

643
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,159
pins the service public key pins then

644
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,220
the client establishes a connection with

645
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,100
the server using the base UE of the

646
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,100
server from the Federation metadata and

647
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,080
the proxy terminates the TLs session

648
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,720
either by populating lists of trusted

649
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,500
Cas using published issues or configure

650
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,299
optional untrusted tiller's client

651
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,880
certificate authentication of the call

652
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,500
option on OCA

653
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,480
the proxim forwards the client

654
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,460
certificate to a server application

655
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,380
the the application converts the public

656
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,320
key to pin and validates the pin against

657
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,860
the published pins if it's valid the

658
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,620
connection is accepted otherwise

659
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,559
terminated

660
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,159
um

661
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,559
for example the local military that can

662
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,860
be stored in a redis the proxy cambian

663
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,460
and genetics Apache F5 or h a proxy

664
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,220
server and the client can be Linker

665
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,360
libker can do pinning out of the box

666
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,640
so next slide please

667
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,520
can I ask a clarifying question yes of

668
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,080
course

669
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,960
why is the proxy verifying

670
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,440
the client's trust chain given that the

671
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,580
servers are going to verify the pin

672
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
anyway yes that's only if you can't use

673
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,500
options here if the software isn't

674
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,960
capable of doing that so that's you have

675
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,440
to bypass a bump on the road

676
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,940
so you don't need to do that

677
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,559
okay so you mean the proxy can not

678
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,159
verify it it doesn't have to verify

679
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,460
okay

680
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,120
looks like this

681
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,380
so uh more questions and then

682
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,460
dispatching this

683
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,739
any questions

684
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,979
related to the dispatch process

685
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:11,000
uh oh Ben was there and removed himself

686
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,899
is there interest no interests okay

687
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,419
so Eric for school yeah I'm just trying

688
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,399
to like I'm not hearing like a lot of

689
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,440
room interest in this and it doesn't

690
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,580
sound to me like there's a lot of like

691
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,559
other people doing this so

692
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,600
as I understand this is like for the

693
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,980
receptive of TLS this is a code Point

694
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,840
registration

695
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,539
um so I guess like you can do a co-point

696
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,120
registration with no RFC at all

697
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,740
um so I guess like

698
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,059
um you know I guess I turned this back

699
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,220
on you is like why don't you publish

700
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,559
take the ID and do a couple magician and

701
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,418
we'll all be happy will that satisfy you

702
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,320
Stephen Farrell

703
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,659
I assume yeah yeah I guess I kind of

704
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:58,860
give you a record

705
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,220
um also I don't I admit not having not

706
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,820
having read the draft I guess but uh

707
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,500
I don't have enough information to

708
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,720
recommend a dispatch outcome based on

709
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,960
today

710
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,620
hi

711
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,580
um just a quick question on it uh or do

712
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,640
the devices in the machine to machine

713
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,860
sides of this need to parse this

714
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,480
metadata

715
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,360
yes

716
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,340
this is the reason you chose

717
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,740
so is there a reason you chose Json

718
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,659
uh

719
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,299
no

720
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,340
it's more modern than XML

721
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,860
if you care about constrained nodes I

722
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,360
would recommend choosing something

723
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,039
that's more appropriate for constrained

724
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,340
nodes

725
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,940
could you please give an example

726
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,480
the typical choice these days would be

727
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,100
seaboard okay

728
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,480
all right Mike unsworth so Carrie Mike

729
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,220
ellensworth carrying over a question

730
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,140
from the mailing list

731
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,760
um clearly there's a need for this

732
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,340
clearly the education institutes you're

733
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,080
working for you know this solves a very

734
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,059
real practical problem yes it wasn't

735
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:28,620
clear from the mailing list that there's

736
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,260
enough sort of different companies all

737
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,600
trying to implement that you really need

738
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,820
a standard if you have two or three

739
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,440
people can you just solve it do you need

740
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,799
ietf to standardize it yeah

741
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,019
but this is I mean we're running

742
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,700
federations for the health sector as

743
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,760
well to to get them to raise funds for

744
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,120
something like this you would need a

745
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,139
standardized specification I guess

746
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,960
okay so I think

747
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,419
I think that wraps up the queue

748
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,480
um it sounds to me that more work is

749
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,719
needed uh and it might be possible to

750
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,760
accomplish this without

751
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,020
A dispatch option so Stefan if you want

752
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
to

753
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,820
do an update or work on the list and do

754
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,079
the ads have any comments

755
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,000
um have you received guidance that helps

756
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,619
you just in terms of you know you do

757
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,440
have options to go forward without

758
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,699
an RNC we will work on with documented

759
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,219
title clarify things and and see where

760
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,520
it goes so okay and if there's some

761
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,260
compelling reason for publication then

762
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,899
it can be Revisited yes

763
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,280
okay

764
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,879
okay it is good so uh don Eastlake is

765
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,199
our last presenter

766
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,099
fnv hash function

767
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,040
hi I'm Donald Eastlake with future

768
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,859
weight Technologies and I've had this

769
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:26,040
draft around for a while about the fnv

770
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,740
hash function it's named after the first

771
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,500
three of the co-authors listed there who

772
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,300
invented it

773
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,619
uh next slide please

774
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,040
so it's uh very simple it's widely used

775
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,200
it's a non-cryptographic hash function

776
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,020
so it's commonly used for things like

777
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,760
calculating something which you use to

778
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,440
get an index into a hash table or

779
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,180
something like that

780
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,700
provides good dispersion even with short

781
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,859
inputs that have only a few bits of

782
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,720
difference stuff like that

783
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,420
and the purpose of the document is to

784
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,660
provide a stable permanent

785
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,099
fnv reference document

786
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,859
hopefully the form of an RFC and it also

787
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,320
provides reference code in C

788
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,900
it's not to provide lists of lots of

789
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,820
different hash functions or to select

790
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,579
the best one there's a complicated quite

791
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,260
different Criterion that can be used for

792
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,240
selecting the best hash function

793
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,259
next slide please

794
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,339
so what you do to do fnv is you

795
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,619
initialize the hash which is a fixed

796
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,980
length power of two normally to a basis

797
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,740
value there's a defaults given in the

798
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,079
draft well you can use other values and

799
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,700
then you take the data and you would go

800
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,680
through successfully taking each octet

801
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,960
of data xored into the bottom of the

802
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,140
hash and multiply by the magic fnv Prime

803
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,700
that's appropriate for the length of the

804
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,480
hash

805
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,780
that's currently defined for for the 32

806
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,040
to a 1024 bits not really defined for

807
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,140
shorter because that's not very high

808
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,720
quality and not defined for larger

809
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,180
because it's uh unclear if that would

810
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,119
really be useful and the Criterion for

811
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,040
picking the prime gets more complicated

812
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,900
and this and that

813
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,859
next slide please

814
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,540
so uh this is how the prime is selected

815
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,940
uh I don't actually understand why this

816
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,260
is good a good way to pick the prime

817
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,780
because I'm not the person who invented

818
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,880
this and haven't done the uh the

819
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,460
analysis that the the authors have done

820
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,160
uh it is the case as mentioned at the

821
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,900
bottom here that the result is the fnv

822
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,940
prime will have only six or seven one

823
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,700
bits in it so for certain types of

824
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,160
implementations it may be more efficient

825
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,440
to do uh some form of Shifting and

826
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,359
adding rather than the general

827
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,300
multi-precision multiplication

828
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,839
uh next slide is a couple of examples so

829
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,920
the fnv Prime in HEX for 32 and 64-bit

830
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,740
cases in all cases the FMV Prime has

831
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,980
four or five bits being one in the

832
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,180
bottom eight

833
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,060
and has the ninth bit on and has one

834
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,599
other bit on higher up in the prime

835
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,780
uh if you want some other power of two

836
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,320
bit or other uh length you can just do

837
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,599
xor folding where you xor some of the

838
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,380
top of the next larger fnv result into

839
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,880
the bottom bits to get a different

840
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
length and of course for most hash table

841
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,740
uses you just have a probably a prime

842
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,540
length hash table and you divide by that

843
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,160
and use the remainder and that sort of

844
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
usual stuff

845
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,740
next slide please

846
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,040
so uh it's used lots of places for

847
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,460
example it's currently used in IEEE

848
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,480
standard 802.1 qbp

849
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,240
2014 and probably because of the lack of

850
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,060
a permanent reference document there

851
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,300
that says use fnv and then gives the

852
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,420
explicit instructions how to do it in

853
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,119
the actual computational instructions

854
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,220
uh there have been have been two

855
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,460
standards track rfcs that used fnv one

856
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,380
of them has since been obsoleted

857
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,079
uh there's a sort of dense line there

858
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
listing a zillion cases which are all

859
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,960
kinds of things where basically it's

860
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,180
used to calculate indexes into hash

861
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,440
tables

862
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,160
uh there is no further there's two URLs

863
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,160
one is to a paper I believe Brian

864
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,380
Carpenter is one of the co-authors which

865
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,099
suggests using it to calculate IPv6 FL

866
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,420
flow identifiers

867
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,260
and it's currently uh suggested in a

868
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,720
document in the BFD working group so

869
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,220
there's actually a great website for it

870
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,960
it's listed at the bottom there the

871
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,300
website has some code including uh even

872
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,720
x86 assembler code for it and things but

873
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,040
uh

874
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,500
uh there's no you know published

875
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,839
document as such

876
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,359
next slide

877
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,079
so I would suggest uh I think the

878
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,780
document is in reasonable shape that ad

879
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,460
sponsor would be a reasonable way to go

880
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,920
and one other piece of information is

881
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,200
that uh Paul Hoffman who is in the room

882
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,540
uh would be available to be document

883
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,079
Shepard

884
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,119
thank you

885
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,180
um to shorten this Roman or Paul do you

886
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,500
wanna

887
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,220
I mean

888
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,200
uh Paul speaking

889
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,119
um so I don't mind 80 sponsoring it if

890
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,700
we don't find another home if like I

891
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,440
would prefer if it would see more View

892
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
and and find a home but if not then I'm

893
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,220
willing to sponsor it okay thank you I

894
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,339
with a hat off that makes sense to me

895
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,680
the 80 sponsorship

896
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,180
so

897
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,500
um I actually sent a list but I think we

898
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,060
didn't close in it so I understand it

899
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,740
there's no changes proposed to this

900
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,540
document to this specific sorry

901
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,700
algorithm anyway namely we're simply

902
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,260
taking a fixed algorithm we are writing

903
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,720
it down correct yes

904
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,900
okay so like that seems like a very like

905
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,160
a little different from our usual thing

906
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,200
where like this is not actually yeah the

907
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,940
ITF is not like endorsing this and it's

908
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,800
not like reviewing it and we're not

909
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,119
changing it we're simply writing it down

910
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,400
so like whatever's most expeditious to

911
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,420
get us like

912
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,400
if we could just like pretend for a

913
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,720
minute internet address for archival we

914
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,460
could just stop this entire conversation

915
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,119
um

916
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,380
um didn't you say that one didn't you

917
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,460
say it was a document already that

918
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,319
already had this written down in it

919
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,119
which document I thought you said one of

920
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,599
the one of the the IEEE standard uh has

921
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,760
uh the computational instructions for

922
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,460
one specific length I believe the 32-bit

923
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,839
the smallest size of FMV uh function uh

924
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,540
but you know it's in the middle of this

925
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,480
gnarly sure okay 100 page document where

926
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,300
it just says you do FMV hash namely take

927
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,160
you know initialize this value to this

928
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,660
number and Matt you know do this Loop

929
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,400
and multiply so uh sure so why should

930
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,839
this go in the ITF stream at all why not

931
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,700
go in the ISE stream independent stream

932
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,819
give okay given that we given again this

933
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,140
is not an IHF Checker work

934
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,480
the answer that so Paul Hoffman um the

935
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,460
fact that this is already used in a

936
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,560
standards track document would make it

937
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,720
inappropriate for the ISC that is the

938
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,359
ISE is saying here's an algorithm that

939
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,040
is already in use in a standards track

940
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,859
document it seems just as easy to get 80

941
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,480
sponsored and such and it's actually

942
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,119
widely used this is DNS cookies

943
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,339
um it's widely used the implementers

944
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,140
were able to figure out by reading Don's

945
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,400
draft

946
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,720
um it should just be something that's an

947
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,119
RFC so really the question is how do we

948
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,920
instantiate this as an RFC

949
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,960
yes my point is about consensus which is

950
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,420
that ITF documents must have consensus

951
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,099
and I'm not sure what the consensus

952
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,660
we're having on is here other than this

953
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,460
is a thing I would say that the

954
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,500
consensus was that this document

955
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,819
correctly

956
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:03,480
documents and describes the function

957
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,460
including in the security considerations

958
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,060
uh exactly why uh it would probably not

959
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,920
be considered cryptographic the security

960
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,619
considerations explains why that's the

961
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,380
case yeah I I was about to say security

962
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,200
considerations is this is going to need

963
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,720
serious oh sorry philhan Baker yeah yeah

964
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,720
uh serious security consideration saying

965
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,240
when to use it and when not to use it

966
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,220
and there are some good applications

967
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,220
within security protocols

968
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,900
for example if you're going to use a

969
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,099
bloom filter

970
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,220
a while back we showed using uh myself

971
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,800
and Rob stradling commode I should using

972
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,160
Bloom filters as a way of speeding up

973
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,079
for crls

974
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,359
you don't want to use a cryptographic

975
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,520
cache for that it's too slow and if

976
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,140
you're going to be throwing it into a

977
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,480
bloom filter collisions don't matter

978
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,560
anyway and so uh it's very important the

979
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,680
other thing is I do have an IPR thing I

980
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
should probably mention back in the day

981
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,880
that there was a guy who was who was

982
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,060
claiming to own the use of a

983
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,619
cryptographic cache for nothing

984
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,680
cryptographic purposes

985
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,619
yes

986
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,359
okay exactly

987
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,540
the fact that you need one is I should

988
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,540
mention that the authors uh have tried

989
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,160
as hard as they can to make sure there

990
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
is no IPR or patent restrictions on this

991
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,319
they uh invented it and published it and

992
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,020
and didn't apply anywhere and nobody

993
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,579
else has ever said anything about the

994
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,040
any of these uses so I'm pretty sure

995
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,460
there's no rpr problems okay so I'm next

996
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,560
in queue no hat

997
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,060
um and then I have Ted Hardy after that

998
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,380
so you might want to add yourself to the

999
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,180
queue

1000
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,900
so I see no reason to not publish this

1001
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,880
through the ad stream this is a typical

1002
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,099
kind of document that gets published

1003
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,859
there and then can go in as a down rough

1004
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,540
as needed for references for other

1005
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,700
documents

1006
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,440
um so I see no problem in the 80

1007
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,540
sponsorship right just to be clear of

1008
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,920
course is just draft targets

1009
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,540
informational

1010
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,660
right and

1011
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,220
okay so next in cue is Ted Hardy

1012
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,140
uh

1013
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,900
thanks I just wanted to ask a clarifying

1014
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,940
question which I believe Paul might know

1015
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,400
the answer to I I took from what he was

1016
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,859
saying that the ISC had rejected this

1017
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,680
document on the basis of the fact uh

1018
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,359
that uh there were standards track

1019
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,920
documents which were referred to it

1020
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,160
which uh seemed quite odd to me and I I

1021
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,280
wanted to confirm my understanding no I

1022
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,500
wasn't saying that at all what I was

1023
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,480
saying was because there is already a

1024
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,099
standards track document it would be

1025
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,339
appropriate if the algorithm that it was

1026
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:53,780
referring to is also on standards track

1027
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,640
this could go through the ISE but

1028
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,640
there's no reason to okay I'm I'm saying

1029
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,839
that given that this is going for

1030
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,940
informational anyway it's not the

1031
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,560
product of the ITF and there's no

1032
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,960
request to the ITF to do anything like

1033
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,240
substantive review I think the ISE is

1034
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,339
exactly the right place for this thanks

1035
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,839
[Music]

1036
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,480
yeah thanks uh so we already have a

1037
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,460
non-cryptographic hash function it's md5

1038
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,800
and there's already an RFC for it and

1039
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,099
there's there's some optimized assembly

1040
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,560
for there's probably even hardware for

1041
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,200
it that exists in the wild so

1042
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,640
is there

1043
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,859
is there a reason as I said at the

1044
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,839
beginning one thing I'd really like to

1045
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,240
avoid is rat holding on comparing hash

1046
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,940
functions and I could say why I think

1047
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,500
there are applications for which this is

1048
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,359
better than the hash function you just

1049
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,740
mentioned which I won't mention the name

1050
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,599
of but I don't want to mention and start

1051
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,640
mentioning names of hash functions and

1052
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,480
getting rat hold

1053
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,140
all right thank you

1054
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,839
so I guess I'm hearing that um it's

1055
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,339
probably 80 sponsorship is the best

1056
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,440
route since nobody else would want to

1057
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,700
pick it up

1058
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,500
so well I

1059
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,960
it seems to me like there was

1060
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,300
a blend of comments here between maybe

1061
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,280
sponsorship and on the one hand and

1062
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,780
maybe the itself taking new action and

1063
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,780
um an apology is

1064
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,880
um are you inclined given given the

1065
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,040
feedback it may not make sense as an ETF

1066
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,839
document are you still inclined to any

1067
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,259
sponsors

1068
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,960
yeah yeah I think process wise what uh

1069
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,640
the Finesse is talking with Paul is

1070
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,020
we're going to pick it up as ad

1071
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,640
sponsorship and then we're going to

1072
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,260
continue to have this conversation that

1073
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,760
we're having if we can find kind of

1074
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,319
consensus to have it on the stream and

1075
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,119
we'll hammer out there

1076
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,119
all right thank you

1077
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,200
stop recapping some of the feedback

1078
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,359
um

1079
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:04,740
Richard just got cut off I think he was

1080
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,559
going to do the summary of all three

1081
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,900
and should be back

1082
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,440
um yeah just recap our uh this year we

1083
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,079
had three items on the agenda here uh

1084
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,180
for the Post Quantum hybrid terminology

1085
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,000
work uh the outcome we came to was to

1086
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,160
either go to the FRG or during the work

1087
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,800
here from the security area uh the 80s

1088
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,780
have the action to lead that discussion

1089
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,220
uh to the conclusion and please are

1090
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,260
going to do an agenda bash and sag on

1091
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,359
our next session

1092
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,940
on the Federated TLS work I think

1093
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,420
there's no action off the ITF here

1094
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,280
um as Ecker pointed out the authors can

1095
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,960
get code points to kill us without

1096
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,000
having an rfcs through many services for

1097
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,619
that path first

1098
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,980
and as we just discussed on and we the

1099
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,680
80s are uh planning to take us forward

1100
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,579
is 80 sponsored and um we'll uh get that

1101
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,740
focused on kind of what what areas of

1102
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,579
review are desired from the ITF

1103
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,619
community

1104
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:08,460
so that's what I have in my notes

1105
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,160
um I think that's the end of the

1106
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,220
dispatch session is that right

1107
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,200
uh there is an open mic so first thank

1108
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,780
you everyone for your assistance in

1109
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,240
helping the ads with shepherding these

1110
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,040
documents and just and helping them with

1111
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,680
their decisions on where they go uh Open

1112
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,900
Mic time any

1113
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,020
SEC dispatch business

1114
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,119
we had one person in the cube that they

1115
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,700
appear to have gone off the line oh

1116
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,920
physical mind

1117
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm sorry Stephen I didn't join the

1118
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,700
queue but somebody else is here I hope

1119
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,540
it's okay

1120
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,720
uh just I I think this sector thing is

1121
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,300
not working as well as hoped in some

1122
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,099
respects

1123
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,900
just if you take today

1124
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,480
personally I I'm not sure the summary is

1125
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,920
reflected how I heard the discussion

1126
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,260
maybe I'm wrong that's fine

1127
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,380
and I think on the for a and c and for B

1128
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,000
I think that should have been a

1129
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,400
discussion on the TFS list and not

1130
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,920
brought to a dispatch process at all

1131
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,660
because I think we're just wasting time

1132
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,099
by doing such things

1133
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,619
so I'd ask that we think again about

1134
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,300
the possibility that somebody suggests

1135
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,579
something to TLS for example and when

1136
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,260
they get a no or a negative or no

1137
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,359
response it ends up in dispatch that

1138
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,339
doesn't seem useful

1139
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:24,960
okay thank you

1140
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,280
noted

1141
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,140
Daniel Khan Gilmore I also failed to get

1142
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,000
in the queue apologies

1143
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,880
um so I actually uh I feel like I didn't

1144
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,740
use SEC dispatch well because I didn't

1145
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,260
mention to SEC dispatch that I have this

1146
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,180
dangerous labels draft but I would have

1147
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,760
actually been useful to do here so part

1148
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,140
of the fact that it's not useful I think

1149
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,400
maybe is people aren't bringing stuff

1150
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,859
here and I'm guilty of that

1151
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,000
um if you haven't seen my dangerous

1152
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,520
labels draft it basically says here's a

1153
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,220
list of DNS labels that you might be

1154
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,540
surprised if you let people register

1155
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,040
them within your Zone because they have

1156
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,619
other consequences and here's a list of

1157
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,079
other of uh email address local parts

1158
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,480
that you also might be upset by because

1159
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,819
they might have security consequences uh

1160
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,460
if you happen to have registered so I

1161
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,380
have no idea where that lands

1162
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,920
um the the some examples are things like

1163
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,880
mta-sts if you let somebody register

1164
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,740
that within your domain you have some

1165
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,260
surprising security properties the email

1166
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,319
local Parts the classic SSL admin

1167
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,059
um

1168
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:25,980
uh things like that um so I'm trying to

1169
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,079
collect like this document as basically

1170
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,359
a Wall of Shame and to remind people

1171
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,119
that if they uh specify something that

1172
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,099
does something like this they get to go

1173
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,720
on the Wall of Shame it's not supposed

1174
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,940
to endorse this practice and it's trying

1175
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,920
to divert people towards things like dot

1176
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,740
well-known and underscore prefix DNS

1177
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,480
labels

1178
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,800
um I have no idea where this would live

1179
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,140
in the ITF

1180
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,880
thank you

1181
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,579
all right and uh dkg that that seems

1182
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:54,720
like it could be uh if you could bring

1183
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,980
that up on the list seems like it could

1184
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,079
be a good uh use case for seeing if we

1185
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,520
can do some dispatching between meetings

1186
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,780
I'll do that thanks Richard

1187
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,660
thank you so we still have

1188
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,119
still have a start on the

1189
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,359
app okay so we will hand over now unless

1190
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,920
there's any questions we'll end SEC

1191
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,440
dispatch and the 80s will begin the SAG

1192
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,859
session

1193
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,800
oh yes

1194
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,339

nope gotten used to it

1198
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,880
it is it should be at the bottom

1199
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,220
and we'll just push over them

1200
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:28,220

thanks for your patience here as we do

1203
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,380
the administrative pivot uh we are

1204
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,720
splitting the SEC dispatch into what we

1205
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,339
just completed was the dispatch process

1206
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:48,839
and we're just going to run into the

1207
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,940
security advisor area Advisory Group

1208
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,220

1210
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,319
co-coad

1211
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:00,660
hi I'm Paul Vargas um I'm fairly new to

1212
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,540
this so um

1213
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,740
please feel free to reach out to me if I

1214
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,240
can reach out to you but I'll also try

1215
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,680
to reach out to the people I haven't

1216
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,079
managed to reach out to

1217
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,540
me all right administratively uh we've

1218
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,800
talked about the note well but we're

1219
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,420
rebroadcasting here everything we said

1220
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,880
for SEC dispatch directly applies here

1221
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,760
and always uh reiterating year that we

1222
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,680
want to live the Dakota conduct and

1223
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,119
these are the basic tenants and

1224
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,740
principles of what we expect for all

1225
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,140
iitf participants

1226
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,359
uh just kind of visual meeting tips

1227
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:31,859
everything we did before for SEC

1228
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,079
dispatch let's continue doing that for

1229
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,400
for this meeting

1230
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,040
agenda wise as we put on the list uh we

1231
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,200
were hoping to have a little bit more uh

1232
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,119
unfortunately some of the the more media

1233
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,559
items kind of fell through so what we

1234
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,180
primarily have prepared is the scanning

1235
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,280
agenda the other thing we're going to

1236
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,500
bash the agenda with is we heard some

1237
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,000
interest in a new direction that we

1238
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,980
hadn't previously heard around a post

1239
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,900
Quantum kind of working group so we're

1240
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,180
going to talk about that after the ad

1241
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,819
report uh we're going to pause here to

1242
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:03,799
say would anyone like to bash the agenda

1243
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,140
checking the queue not seeing anyone all

1244
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:15,740
right so we are gonna move along so Paul

1245
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,839
um so so one thing that I uh I notice is

1246
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,940
that our pool of working group chairs is

1247
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,440
fairly low and some people might not

1248
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,720
realize that we are looking for for both

1249
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,700
experience and inexperience for group

1250
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,160
chairs just to sort of know that we have

1251
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,900
people that we can reach out to once you

1252
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,000
have like you know a chair resigning or

1253
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,819
a new worker group forming so um please

1254
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:37,200
don't think that you need to be like a

1255
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,020
10 year old iitfer before you can uh be

1256
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,579
considered for a worker group chair so

1257
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,619
if there's something you might be

1258
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,540
interested in please reach out to us or

1259
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,700
we at least know that you know we have a

1260
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,319
few names of people that that we could

1261
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:52,020
call upon uh once an opening comes up so

1262
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,400
please do that

1263
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,280
uh second uh even better if you're if

1264
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,900
you're a newcomer and you really want to

1265
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,059
learn more about the process within ITF

1266
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,740
becoming a document Shepard is actually

1267
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,480
a really great way of learning more

1268
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,160
about the process um

1269
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,260
and in addition you will help us because

1270
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,599
unfortunately because of the shortage of

1271
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,119
shepherds we have who usually or too

1272
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,280
often have chairs doing that work

1273
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,260
themselves or document offers doing most

1274
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,180
of that work instead of having you know

1275
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,480
an objective uh external person doing

1276
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,160
this work so

1277
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,839
um if you want to read up on what a

1278
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,280
Shepherd is if you want to talk to one

1279
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,880
of us about about what it involves

1280
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,160
please yeah please let us know um it's a

1281
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,319
it's a really great way for uh for you

1282
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,940
to to get to know the ITF a little bit

1283
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,960
better

1284
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,780
and then uh number three

1285
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,059
um we do have a lot of erratas uh

1286
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:43,500
outstanding

1287
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,960
um especially the erratas in the

1288
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,640
reported state that needs handling like

1289
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,740
so so um the work group needs to find

1290
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,559
out whether this Errata is is correct or

1291
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:53,880
not

1292
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,380
um there's a lot of work on on that we

1293
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,440
have a pretty big backlog and

1294
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,720
uh one of my goals as a new Fresh ad

1295
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,460
with too much energy is that I'm going

1296
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,319
to try and push the working groups into

1297
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,420
doing a little bit more focused Errata

1298
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,579
handling so you'll see on the slides for

1299
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:09,980
the working groups that are following

1300
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,420
that we are listing the amount of

1301
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,339
erratas that you have unresolved in the

1302
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:15,420
hope that

1303
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,099
you will be ashamed to solve them

1304
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,920
Richard did you hop in for some

1305
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,359
commentary here

1306
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:27,000
yeah I'm just going to thank the ads for

1307
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,160
for helping develop talents in our area

1308
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,020
I think this is a great idea I was going

1309
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,760
to offer a friendly Amendment for folks

1310
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,799
who might be experienced chairs

1311
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,540
um if you happen to be an experienced

1312
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,220
chair and your co-chair is also an

1313
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,599
experienced chair

1314
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,339
um I kind of think you're doing it wrong

1315
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,020
um so if you're an experienced chair I

1316
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,640
would suggest talking to the ideas about

1317
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,319
getting an inexperienced here to work

1318
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,940
with to help develop this talent pool

1319
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,980
and build a build up more leadership in

1320
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,000
our space thanks

1321
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,440
so Richard doesn't mean you're offering

1322
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
to step down

1323
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,140
I'm just kidding

1324
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:05,460
I I have tried we have tried to bring in

1325
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,400
uh you know folks in this role um I

1326
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,680

1328

00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,079
all right so the next standing item we

1334
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,000
have here are working group summaries

1335
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,059
and uh due to Paul's kind of hard work

1336
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,619
we have a slightly more informative

1337
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,420
format

1338
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,400
given that we are very very early in the

1339
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,020
week historically we do this much later

1340
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,520
in the week many of the working groups

1341
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,059
have not yet met as we bring kind of

1342
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:43,680
things together if any of the chairs or

1343
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,880
working group participants want to come

1344
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,339
up and talk into the mic we'll move at a

1345
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,140
slightly slower Cadence if you'd like to

1346
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,760
comment about what's imminent in the

1347
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,020
work you work

1348
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,420
so Ace is not planning to meet with

1349
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,220
someone like to say something about Ace

1350
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,760
and we can always do go backs so we can

1351
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,740
keep this moving so Acme is meeting

1352
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,520
later this week

1353
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:11,640
all right

1354
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,720
coming up to the mic

1355
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,420
I you have near Couture effectney uh so

1356

1357
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,079

00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,619

1361
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,780
perfect thanks

1362
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,500

emu

1366
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,780
I think we have a Version Control

1367
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,799
problem in slides

1368
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:03,299
so dots emu nap

1369
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,040
my two NSF these are readable slides

1370
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,380
we'll go quickly that if folks uh

1371
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,240
you want to make some comments here

1372
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,339
yeah I'm just going to run to the end

1373
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:18,660
and if folks want to say something about

1374
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,400
their SEC working group they can Tee It

1375
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,520
Up

1376
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,780
all right we're pausing if any working

1377
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,040
group chairs want to come up to talk

1378
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,299
about the workers we're just going to do

1379
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,400
it that way all right Sean Turner I'm

1380
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,740
going to shamelessly plug MLS both the

1381
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,359
protocol draft and the architecture

1382
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:37,619
draft have been through working group

1383
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:39,660
last call the protocol draft actually

1384
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,040
went through multiple working group last

1385
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,619
calls but they're good to go if you

1386
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:44,940
remember when we started this it was a

1387
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,500
little bit like the TLs development we

1388
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,119
wanted to make sure that we had some

1389
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,339
buying from the security community and

1390
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:51,839
in during the working group last call

1391
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,940
like we got Karthik and others and like

1392
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,500
Brita Hale to like put their thumbs up

1393
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,420
on the draft so that'll be coming your

1394
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,040
way Paul shortly

1395
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,240
um basically I just need the

1396
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,400
architecture draft to get reposted now

1397
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,839
we didn't get as much review on that

1398
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,400
draft but that's because it's

1399
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,700
kind of more flowery so but in any event

1400
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,140
I think those two are good to go and so

1401
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,280
we're kind of switching off into like

1402
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,559
looking at extensions and I suspect

1403
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,119
version two will be coming on very

1404
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,160
shortly thanks

1405
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,319
appreciate it

1406
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:22,079
hello Siobhan said co-chair of Ojai um

1407
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,640
just wanted to say that I think we're

1408
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,140
almost ready to go with the main

1409
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,020
protocol draft We'll be asking for last

1410
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,700
call soon and there's a bunch of new

1411
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,319
work in the group that we'll be

1412
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:33,000
discussing today later today in the

1413
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,240
meeting

1414
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,819
so Sam I see you in the Q

1415
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,680
yeah I'll give a plug for privacy

1416
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,980
preserving measurement we have a small

1417
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,839
Core group of people working on the one

1418
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,299
adopted draft I would love to have more

1419
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,160
eyes on it and a wider group of people

1420
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,900
looking at it we also have one new

1421
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,940
proposal and I won't say new because it

1422
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,099
was presented at Vienna

1423
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:59,780
that might become up for adoption

1424
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,819
thank you

1425
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,740
any other working group chairs want to

1426
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,399
comment on there

1427
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,160
so uh we wanted to make sure we also

1428
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,440
raise awareness we have more Buffs than

1429
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,299
we've had in recent memory in the

1430
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,700
security area happening this week we had

1431
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,460
a buff yesterday the the Json web proofs

1432
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,760
the jwp that unfortunately ran a little

1433
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,240
bit at a time we have skit coming up

1434
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,599
this Thursday and we have Sac P that's

1435
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,180
later later this afternoon so skid is

1436
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,579
focused on what can the ITF do around

1437
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:40,980
certain elements of the supply chain and

1438
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,440
sap is focused on distributed ledgers

1439
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,420
and how we can Bridge some of those so

1440
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,799
we're going to need some sharp eyes to

1441
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,539
help us figure out what's right on the

1442
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:51,000
scope there what we want to do here and

1443
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,859
we of course need to answer do we have

1444
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:54,720
the energy to work on those so we do

1445
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,400
request that the community kind of come

1446
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,780
and kind of help us figure out what the

1447
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,980
way ahead is on

1448
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,059
two bodies of work

1449
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:03,359
and there's this kind of standing

1450
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,740
practice we have a lot of other security

1451
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,599
areas things that are related to

1452
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,640
security happening both in the ITF and

1453
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,579
the re the irtf plus uh in other places

1454
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,900
in the community if someone wants to

1455
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,819
come to the to the mic this is the The

1456
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,980
Collection that I believe we are roughly

1457
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,140
tracking but we welcome commentary not

1458
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,380
only just on these but on others

1459
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,700
yeah this is Barry Lee but chair of

1460
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,480
dmarc we're meeting on Thursday and the

1461
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,780
primary bit of discussion will be

1462
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,980
um the issue we have now with

1463
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,900
identifying the correct organizational

1464
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,839
domain in some cases where we are

1465
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,819
looking at replacing the use of the

1466
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,280
public suffix list with instead a tree

1467
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,000
walk and an additional dmarc tag and

1468
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,280
that's been quite a lot of controversy

1469
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,200
on the list so that's that's the main

1470
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,160
discussion this time

1471
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,960
uh I don't see tigers up there but um or

1472
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,660
maybe I do um anyway Tigress is a

1473
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,299
credential transfer

1474
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:05,400
protocol and has definitely it's in the

1475
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,020
art but it has obvious security

1476
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,520
implications

1477
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,319
so it would be great to get a little bit

1478
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,119
more people from the security area and

1479
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,160
that working group to help review and

1480
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,260
look at document stuff like that

1481
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,579
contribute

1482
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:19,380
thanks for mentioning Tigers uh so for

1483
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,819
those that have been following along we

1484
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,960
had the secret life before ietf 13.

1485
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,819
there was obviously Community feedback

1486
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,980
that that name was not super so that

1487
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,079
work turned into tigers that that was

1488
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,299
just mentioned and there was some back

1489
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:35,160
and forth during that which is this a

1490
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,839
sex thing is this an art thing it's

1491
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,880
somewhere in between so the way that got

1492
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,099
negotiated out is it will remain in art

1493
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,960
but it's going to have a sec ad so

1494
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,880
please we do need exactly like I said we

1495

a an error in the chair slides

1513
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:36,180
um because uh the report for Utah seemed

1514
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,839
to be copy pasted

1515
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:42,240
with the TLs that is just preceded in

1516
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,619

1519
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,200
uh I like to bring attention in the drip

1520
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,920
warp group the drip off draft is in work

1521
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,799
group last call and we do need reviewers

1522
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,000
of it

1523
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,039
um it's been just really only internally

1524
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:11,280
reviewed and uh our chairs have caught

1525
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,440
can we have please have reviewers of the

1526
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,599
draft so we complete the last call

1527
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,299
within the work group so

1528
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,059
the auth graph is all about

1529
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,400
authentication of these messages in an

1530
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,280
extremely constrained environment of

1531
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,920
basically payload of 200 bytes got to do

1532
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,059
it in that so uh we do welcome and

1533
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,460
request that the largest community look

1534
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,160
at what we're doing there in that draft

1535
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,539
um if you need you unfortunately there

1536
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:40,980
is a lot of background you need to know

1537
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,680
why we're doing the way we are but we're

1538
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,180
available the authors are available for

1539
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,940
for giving that context so invite

1540
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,940

1544
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,920
on working groups or Community activity

1545
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,539
that would likely be interesting here

1546
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:11,058
Dave I I see you you can come to the mic

1547
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:12,599
yes I was having problems getting up

1548
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,460
getting booked it but my name in the

1549
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,559
queue so if

1550
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,539
um so I if it's okay I wanted to bring

1551
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:22,200
up Sam is Sam is Dave Taylor

1552
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,299
um in the uh rats working group this

1553
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:27,539
week there was a presentation from Carl

1554
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:31,200
uh about a format for configuring trust

1555
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,119
anchors in a trust anchor store right

1556
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,319
not a protocol

1557
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,000
but a way to encapsulate a set of trust

1558
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,200
anchors to configure on a particular

1559
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,000
machine that can be carried in other

1560
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,660
protocols rats would make use of this

1561
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,039
um but it was pointed out to the meeting

1562
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:47,039
by me and others that other working

1563
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,799
groups including suit which I coach here

1564
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,680
and teep where I author documents both

1565
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,940
need the same thing

1566
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,059
and so the question was maybe it

1567
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:58,319
shouldn't go into the rats working group

1568
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,839
because it's more of a general mechanism

1569
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,059
not sure where it should go

1570
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:03,780
um

1571
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,520
but I told them that maybe this is the

1572
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,599
sort of thing that should come to SEC

1573
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,460
dispatch or something in the future so I

1574
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,480
just wanted to bring that up here

1575
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,160
because if there's other working groups

1576
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,599
besides those three that have an opinion

1577
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:14,520
then that may affect where it should

1578
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,080
best go so Roman was there for all this

1579
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,460
discussion

1580
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,080
um but I just want to surface it to the

1581
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,859
rest of SEC so

1582
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,839
in the jabber that there's some interest

1583
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:28,679
in if someone can talk about Mimi oh

1584
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:30,060
no I'm not saying I'm going to talk

1585
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,500
about it Stephen if you were going to

1586
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,939
talk about maybe

1587
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,920
oh you're asking so if someone can tell

1588
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,779
us a little bit more about Mimi I was

1589
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,339
conflicted and was unable to attend

1590
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:39,960
please feel free to come up to them like

1591
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,620
now or comment on

1592
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,198
okay I think uh I think that's it for

1593
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:48,060
the for the wrap up for in-flight

1594
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,819
activities so we're gonna roll straight

1595
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:53,520
into Paul and I are going to tag team a

1596
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,698
little bit on the uh on our ad report

1597
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,979
uh so just to give everyone a bit of a

1598
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:00,658
heads up we are holding a couple of

1599
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:02,698
documents that are in flight for ad

1600
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:05,219
sponsorship uh phenomenal news since the

1601
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:07,439
last time we talked we have two new rfcs

1602
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,100
on security.txt and on the XML SEC

1603
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,080
identifiers and you can see it's kind of

1604
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,779
behind us where we are a little a little

1605
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:17,698
earlier in the life cycle on the two

1606
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:21,678
other Ed sponsored uh minutes

1607
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,799
these are a few standing pointers but

1608
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,600
these are repeated questions that that

1609
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,238
Paul and I get which are what is what

1610
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,679
are you working on what's in the queue

1611
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,060
kind of what's hot why have you not

1612
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,520
looked at my document uh so anyone that

1613
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,198
wants to kind of understand where we are

1614
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,060
in status and where your document might

1615
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,158
be in our review queue please do

1616
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:43,198
dereference those that middle block of

1617
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:44,939
URLs behind us

1618
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,640
another piece uh another another pointer

1619
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,279
we wanted to actively share is that Paul

1620
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,738
and I and previously been discussed on a

1621
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:54,840
lot of common issue common issues so we

1622
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,820
would see them recurring in a recurring

1623
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,100
fashion during our Ed review we want to

1624
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,380
highlight what those are and we we took

1625
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,940
the time to document it on that first

1626
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,400
URL so if you are you as you are going

1627
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,840
into working from class Paul in your

1628
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,460
document that's a great place to kind of

1629
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,800
check you know did we think about these

1630
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,020
particular issues before things would

1631
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,460
exit exit the working group

1632
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,860
and in other pointers just to bring you

1633
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,239
know make sure we have cross visibility

1634
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,280
on where we stand with things we've had

1635
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,500
some movement on working groups uh you

1636
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,880
know starting early in the life cycle

1637
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,560
this is the most boss we've had in

1638
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,840
recent every in the SEC area again

1639

1641
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,840
the jwp conversation on the Jose list

1642
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,140

1643

1644
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,280
problems

1645

and we really do have an older set of

1646
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:54,600
slides here uh so uh so we've had some

1647
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,640
some motion on working group changes so

1648
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,980
I think I saw Mohit come in in the end

1649
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,800

01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,140
prachi and leaf are spearheading tigress

1658
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,080
and uh in the data tracker we have a new

1659
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,940
version of those slides and big thanks

1660
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,040
to Robbie Harwood who was long time

1661
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,040
co-chair of kind of kitten and uh Ben

1662
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,380
who is remotely connected vincated is

1663
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,140
gonna jump in to to be the the other

1664
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,620
co-chair of of Kit as Paul said from the

1665
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,179
kind of the beginning we are always

1666
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:43,679
looking for those that might be

1667
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,540
interested in ship roles and working

1668
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,000
groups or certainly being if that's a

1669
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,860
little too much being documented

1670
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,020
Shepherds if you are interested in being

1671
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,239
working group chair experience not

1672
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,000
experience signaling that to us is uh

1673
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,380
you know is always of Interest we do

1674
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,820
keep a running list as we find

1675
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,800
Opportunities either to write rotate the

1676
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,480
current leadership team or to make

1677
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,179
selections for for kind of new working

1678
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:08,540
groups

1679
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,480
I I don't think I need to plug it here

1680
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,219
but one of the things that we have

1681
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:16,320
realized that some of our non-working

1682
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,880
group mailing lists don't get visibility

1683
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,219
after the second we create them so we

1684
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:21,420
want to make sure we highlight them here

1685
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,880
the pqc mailing list that is a

1686
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,679
non-working mailing list to discuss

1687
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,659
whatever the community would like around

1688
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,179
post Quantum post Quantum Computing we

1689
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,100
have created that pleased to use that

1690
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,260
mailing list if there is not one

1691
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,460
appropriate to the working group

1692
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,900
uh would you like to handle lorata

1693
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,739
I talked already a little bit about the

1694
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:49,080
aradas it is really important that we

1695
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,179
get them get them reduced uh there's

1696
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:52,920
some working groups that that have a lot

1697
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,060
of them

1698
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,460
um and additionally uh um a somewhat

1699
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,440
harder one that falls down between the

1700
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,480
cracks even more is the ones for on

1701
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,219
documents that have no longer any open

1702
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:04,500
working group and nobody is looking at

1703
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,840
those erratas and so uh so so I didn't

1704
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,880
even actually count them I'm not even

1705
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,320
sure if they're counted in in the

1706
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,520
numbers that are on the current slide

1707
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,620
because we kind of look at the working

1708
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,179
group so

1709
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:19,440
um if anyone wants to to volunteer uh to

1710
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,179
spearhead any of these efforts then

1711
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,460
please let us know otherwise we will

1712
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,920
continue bugging people about solving

1713
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,120
around us

1714
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,760
yeah I mean I think the bottom line to

1715
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,260
point out is we started highlighting

1716
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,900
this last time and we are in fact losing

1717
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,199
ground so while we we closed some Parada

1718
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,300
we got a whole bunch more and so we have

1719
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,159
a little more than we had last time we

1720
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:42,300
would really ask that those working

1721
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,159
groups highlighted kind of at the bottom

1722
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,500
there those are I think the the vast

1723
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,960
majority of where we have inrata in open

1724
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,699
work groups if you could please kind of

1725
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:53,400
take that up and we will work on on

1726
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,500
handling and trying to Federate uh

1727
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,880
support and review of the ones that do

1728
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,060
not have accurate

1729
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,940
yeah that brings up rich Saul sock my

1730
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,739
um that brings up a probably is the

1731
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:06,600
answer to the lamps one because from

1732
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,760
what I've seen Russ is really diligent

1733
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,360
about that so these old P kicks 5280

1734
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,300
yeah that's right uh so thank you kind

1735
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,159
of for finessing that when we made that

1736
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:19,380
work group list that's not directly

1737
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,600
bound to the necessarily the working

1738
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,800
group it's a little bit about the

1739
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,540
technology associated with it so some of

1740
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,340
the ones for lamps are indeed a lot of

1741
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:30,080
old Peaks thanks absolutely

1742
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,159
Paul Hoffman um wearing a very different

1743
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,020
hat I've actually been reviewing a lot

1744
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:37,140
of Errata and updates for not for

1745
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,659
security stuff one thing I've found is

1746
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:42,540
that in fact as I tell people I'm

1747
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,739
working you know like going through

1748
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:45,780
Errata I hear from many software

1749
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,840
developers of oh my God I wish I had

1750
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,020
known that this Errata had been reported

1751
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,420
but not included in this RFC that I

1752
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,300
implemented implemented wrong and was

1753
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,580
laughed at by other developers who knew

1754
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,800
that the Errata had been reported so

1755
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,600
it's not just I mean I think people

1756
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,420
think Errata is often grammatical which

1757
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,219
some of them are but there are some

1758
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:10,560
significant things including wrong check

1759
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,560
sums in in Sample code and such like

1760
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,140
that that really have an effect on on

1761
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,540
implementers so the fact that some of

1762
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,219
the working groups are so far behind

1763
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:22,920
actually impedes the implementation of

1764
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,440
their standards

1765
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,559
yeah

1766
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,900
the sparity but following up on that the

1767
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,140
I believe the RFC editor has agreed to

1768
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,840
try to handle it any new era that come

1769
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,179
in that are purely editorial and the RFC

1770
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:41,580
editor is supposed to handle those so

1771
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,500
we're really looking at

1772
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,080
the new era and well and existing Errata

1773
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,960
that are technical in nature and uh and

1774
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,500
there are far too many

1775
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,239
yeah you're exactly right it's been a

1776
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,159
big help that the RFC had folks have

1777
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,440
helped us with that

1778
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,360
okay so again General call here

1779
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,340
the other thing we we want to make sure

1780
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,500
that we say a huge kind of thank you for

1781
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,719
is one of the things that Paul and I

1782
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,480
have to do is bring forward the various

1783
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,880
documents to the to the isg for

1784
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,040
advancement or to do community to review

1785
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,420
the things coming from the rest of the

1786
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,820
community and that workflow is directly

1787
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,500
enabled by the people that you see

1788
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,840
broadcasted there thank you thank you so

1789
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,580
much to the security kind of director

1790
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,100
your reviews are directly impacting

1791
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,140
quality of the things we publish they're

1792
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,820
directly making sure that we don't

1793
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,679
publish things here in the ietf that

1794
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,020
have security security implications and

1795
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,100
that will break things on the internet

1796
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,420
and they are a tremendous help

1797
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,219
personally to both Paul and I as we

1798
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:43,020
continue to do those reviews so thank

1799
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,699
you to the team kind of back there and

1800
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,620
also thank you for Teru for facilitating

1801
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,780
the assignment of those reviews uh it

1802
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,980
really makes the magic happen

1803
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:56,460
okay so uh we have plenty of Open Mic

1804
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,960
time but before we were going to run

1805
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,580
into the open mic time we wanted to

1806
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,560
Pivot back in the agenda bash that we

1807
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,420
promised uh during kind of SEC dispatch

1808
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,320
to revisit this idea of what is the

1809
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,420
threshold for which we'd want to set for

1810
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,980
a post for Quantum working group

1811
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,800
whatever that might be uh to level set

1812
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,179
here because I'm doing this entirely

1813
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:16,620
kind of on the Fly since we brought this

1814
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,719
up at SEC dispatch I believe we had a

1815
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,500
conversation at ITF 111 where the notion

1816
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,840
was floated listen post Quantum things

1817
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,600
are coming we have working groups that

1818
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,000
that are open and if they are open they

1819
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,239
will be best positioned to to me kind of

1820
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,980
the challenges of post Quantum agility

1821
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,140
that's going to come what we didn't have

1822
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,580
our head wrapped around is there will

1823
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,440
likely be all sorts of protocols we want

1824
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,600
to think about

1825
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,219
that perhaps don't have active work

1826
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,020
groups and there's no ready way to do

1827
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,760
maintenance and so the proposal at the

1828
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,280
time at 111 was hey why don't we spin up

1829
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,020
a post Quantum agility working group

1830
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,600
that would be the home to house these

1831
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,699
for lack of a better term orphan kind of

1832
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:58,260
specifications so we could treat them as

1833
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,480
a one-off we got all sorts of kind of

1834
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,620
feedback the feedback roughly was hey uh

1835
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,940
are you confident that you would have

1836
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,500
the expertise in this working group to

1837
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,199
pick up one of those orphaned uh one of

1838
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:11,820
those orphan working group and kind of

1839
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,060
the pros and cons are maybe maybe not uh

1840
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,739
the it's a bit of a it was a bit of a

1841
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:18,300
scalability argument that if we can do

1842
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,219
it in one place it might reduce pressure

1843
01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:22,920
friction for the agility the other piece

1844
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,320
of feedback was well okay in theory we

1845
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,820
understand the

1846
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,920
the thinking on this working group but

1847
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,480
what would be the first bodies of work

1848
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,340
that you'd want to run through this

1849
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,739
process and that was a place where we

1850
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:36,540
did not we got a little bit of feedback

1851
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,340
but not a lot of feedback of what

1852
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,260
protocols were dropping there and then

1853
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,360
the last set of feedback was can we in

1854
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,100
fact move forward without algorithm

1855
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,080
recommendations on what we would drop

1856
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,179
for uh to do Post Squad and

1857
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:49,620
pedophageality and the push was

1858
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,420
primarily can we do this without miss

1859
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,280
making some decisions out of kind of

1860
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,800
round three so coming out of 111 we

1861
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,719
roughly left that that notion of a

1862
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:59,100
working group we have a template for it

1863
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,960
we can continue having it the

1864
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,520
interesting development I heard today

1865
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,280
kind of talking was that there is quite

1866
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,780
a lot of interest and momentum to

1867
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,880
continue this conversation and perhaps

1868
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,679
it might be sufficient that the

1869
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,960
threshold for having such a forum is

1870
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,760
actually just being having a place to

1871
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,380
talk about it and get our heads around

1872
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,900
what that terminology uh terminology

1873
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,060
might be and I'm going to start I'm

1874
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,320
going to kind of stop talking and say

1875
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,239
kind of discuss do we think that that's

1876
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,880
a sufficient kind of threshold what are

1877
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,080
there things we need to be worried about

1878
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,880
relative to agility right now that we

1879
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,340
don't have in things like TLS lamps uh

1880
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,120
ipsec

1881
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,159
I mean this was sort of the concept

1882
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:42,600
behind curdle when we did it before

1883
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,620
right

1884
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,679
um

1885
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,120
I mean I guess I think this may be a

1886
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,739
little premature

1887
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,000
um we literally just got the

1888
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,580
recommendations like what two weeks ago

1889
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,560
um so maybe we should like try to do

1890
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,820
some of the protocols that we actually

1891
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,980
know and like are being heavily

1892
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:01,920
maintained and get some of those beaten

1893
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,719
down a little bit and then

1894
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:04,980
um and then and then try to take those

1895
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,540
learnings and and try to do the ones

1896
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,040
that are maintained I mean by definition

1897
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,420
the ones that are maintained are like

1898
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,000
the ones that are sort of like less

1899
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,920
um less actively developed

1900
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,239
um so I think you know anything we do

1901
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:16,620
will probably we'll probably have a long

1902
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,900
camera anyway so I mean I think maybe

1903
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,040
like

1904
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,960
I mean maybe let's try to kill ipsec and

1905
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,120
TLS and

1906
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,679
um you know so

1907
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,679
um you know x59 and and one of the you

1908
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:29,760
know and then you want to messaging

1909
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,980
formats um and then we'll see that then

1910
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,940
we'll have a template between the rest

1911
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,380
of them um but I think try and do them

1912
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,400
all at once it's probably not gonna work

1913
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,800
out super well

1914
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,179
great thank you and then in terms of

1915
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:41,520
scope uh again I think we have two

1916
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,400
things to talk about uh is both the the

1917
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,199
maintenance piece and if those folks

1918
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:47,880
think that they need a working group to

1919
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,380
have continued kind of conversations

1920
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,880
there is kind of some precedent other

1921
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,860
areas in the ITF to kind of spin

1922
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,239
something that up or to talk about

1923
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,460
terminology or frameworky kinds of

1924
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,900
things so I think everything's on the

1925
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,159
table sure

1926
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,620
I think as I said by put for the

1927
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,560
terminology is cfrg so um so I guess I'm

1928
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,179
just really creating another group with

1929
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:07,920
like kind of like an unbounded Charter

1930
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,300
um so like I said I think

1931
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,040
um I think I would like

1932
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,300
be a little bit downward and say let's

1933
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,199
see nothing

1934
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,860
um just for the moment

1935
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,600
my I have two points here one is um plug

1936
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,360
for like centralization I think all

1937
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,620
Protocols are going to have to answer

1938
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,020
all of the same problems do we hybrid do

1939
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,239
we Flag Day what about size which are

1940
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,159
the parameter sets like every group is

1941
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,179
going to have to Grapple with these

1942
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:35,400
let's grapple with them once let's have

1943
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,900
one group that can say hey why don't you

1944
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,520
do it TLS day why don't you do what

1945
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,780
ipsec did

1946
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,480
like so just centralization of trying to

1947
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,760
not repeat the same debates over and

1948
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,320
over and over again everywhere

1949
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,600
second point I want to make is I'll

1950
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,000
credit this idea to um Ali Becker and

1951
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Rebecca gutri that there's going to be

1952
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,679
protocols that are forgotten that don't

1953
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,900
have a home so a place to sort of drag

1954
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,880
up all this stuff that needs to be

1955
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,320
updated but no one's looking at

1956
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,520
thanks

1957
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,060
Phil Phil hamburger yeah I don't

1958
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:12,540
understand the post Quantum algorithms

1959
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,480
and I suspect that yes that was going to

1960
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,800
be my point

1961
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,199
you know I I suspect most of us that

1962
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:23,040
aren't from the point of view of how do

1963
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,520
we apply them to a protocol existing or

1964
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,980
past I don't think that we've actually

1965
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,440
got that knowledge yet

1966
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,360
I don't think it exists because you know

1967
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,100
you have the algorithms you have the

1968
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,679
cryptographic protocols you have the

1969
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,480
wire protocols

1970
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,300
you know pki is not the same as public

1971
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,100
key cryptography

1972
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,020
it's going to be the same thing for post

1973
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,219
quantum

1974
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:49,139
what I think we probably need is

1975
01:22:49,139 --> 01:22:50,699
probably something that's

1976
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:54,179
kind of like an irtf working group

1977
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,239
in that we need to do a bit of education

1978
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,820
and a bit of leveling up of everybody

1979
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,219
and explaining what's going on

1980
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:04,679
we've got to have a bit of people

1981
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,600
bringing in the

1982
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,400
thing that they've developed in their

1983
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,460
basement and showing it off

1984
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,040
and we've probably got to do that for

1985
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,440
quite a few years before we're really

1986
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,480
going to understand this area

1987
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,580
but the good news is

1988
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,620
I've also got this degree in nuclear

1989
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,840
physics you know I did experimental in

1990
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,179
nucleophysics I can spot a science

1991
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,280
project when I see one

1992
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,679
and you know looking at where Google and

1993
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,780
IBM are today I am not worried about a

1994
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,699
quantum computer arriving in the next

1995
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:40,260
five years

1996
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,600
yeah I'm not desperately worried that

1997
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,659
we're going to we have to uh do this on

1998
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:46,739
a

1999
01:23:46,739 --> 01:23:50,040
um an emergency basis there is time to

2000
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,380
do it right and so maybe something in

2001
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,900
the irtf uh asking them to spin

2002
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,600
something up would be the way forward I

2003
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,120
mean yes they have a post-quantum sorry

2004
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,639
they have a Quantum Internet working

2005
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,679
group but that's different this will be

2006
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:08,699
post Quantum uh protocols

2007
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:10,080
thanks

2008
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,699
Michael

2009
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:13,560
hi Michael Richardson I guess I'm

2010
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,080
largely agreeing with others um I I

2011
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,219
don't think we need to run around

2012
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,739
building a group for orphaned protocols

2013
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:21,420
I think that

2014
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:24,120
um uh we need to do it we need to we

2015
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,739
need to do it for the protocols that we

2016
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:28,139
know already and

2017
01:24:28,139 --> 01:24:31,139
um I think that that for those orphan

2018
01:24:31,139 --> 01:24:33,420
protocols that might be out there I

2019
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,920
suspect that for many of them the

2020
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,960
correct answer I I don't know what they

2021
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,060
are but I suspect the correct answer is

2022
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:41,639
uh uh uplift to TLS or something like

2023
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:43,620
that and that that's as much work as

2024
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,659
fixing whatever they had out there okay

2025
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,820
so I think that that's what one thing

2026
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:50,520
thing the other part of it is that

2027
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,780
um although we have a bunch of

2028
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,719
certificate post Quantum hybrid whatever

2029
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,100
that means

2030
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,900
um uh protocols in in lamps

2031
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,840
I don't feel very confident that we have

2032
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,580
any idea really where we're going that

2033
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:10,320
way and that is really the

2034
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,040
um

2035
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,280
signed data at rest problem which is

2036
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,639
very different from the ipsecond TLs uh

2037
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:20,520
negotiation problem and I and we could

2038
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,960
actually solve I think we could actually

2039
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,480
solve those things in either order

2040
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,480
right we could replace the the

2041
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,040
diffie-hellmans on the protocols with

2042
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,659
post Quantum versions and we could

2043
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,580
replace the certificates with post

2044
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,460
Quantum certificates uh signatures and

2045
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,780
we actually could do those in either

2046
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,760
order I mean it would make don't you

2047
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,500
don't you don't get any any success

2048
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,080
until you have both but from a point of

2049
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,820
view of how do we test deployment and

2050
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,500
how do we do other things

2051
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,600
I suspect it really doesn't matter and

2052
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,920
as I agree with Phil that we probably

2053
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,139
have a little bit of luxury of time here

2054
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:54,480
so I would say actually the critical one

2055
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,420
in my mind is the the certificate and

2056
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,920
the data at rest because it's going to

2057
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,100
be at rest for possibly decades and

2058
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,420
that's the part that makes me anxious

2059
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,699
more than the other part right browsers

2060
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,260
will just upgrade every second week and

2061
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:10,800
we'll be done right thanks

2062
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,260
pardon me

2063
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,420
yes yes yes of course of course but but

2064
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,480
I mean I I assume I assume that people

2065
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,940
don't don't always show their encrypted

2066
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,280
data to everybody but that sign data

2067
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,560
often gets you know out as a place

2068
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,440
because you want people to see it right

2069
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,040
thanks Scott uh Scott Fleur Cisco

2070
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,739
Systems uh one point uh people have

2071
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:37,380
noted that we have plenty a lot of some

2072
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,179
amount of time to solve this problem I

2073
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:42,480
would like to uh to disagree with the

2074
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,760
idea that it's too early to get started

2075
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,820
uh we have plenty of time however this

2076
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,340
is a big task in front of us uh uh at

2077
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:53,340
the very least uh you know if we have uh

2078
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,340
both next uh ietf 115 we might have a

2079
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,739
working group starting at 116. that's

2080
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:00,960
that's eight months right there plus

2081
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,659
then uh they have a bunch of time

2082
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:06,360
working on the various deciding what to

2083
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,699
do and and actually designing the the

2084
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:12,300
updated protocols uh that can two up a

2085
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,739
significant amount of time uh I would

2086
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:20,340
yeah and and then and then as uh Michael

2087
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,620
mentioned uh deploying the plane is even

2088
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,520
worse so uh I would recommend

2089
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,340
considering to starting uh above uh next

2090
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,719
ITF

2091
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:31,620
Ace

2092
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,139
thanks Paul's next

2093
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,360
Paul Hoffman um so many people in the

2094
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,760
room uh might remember Hillary Orman who

2095
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,639
was very active in the ITF she wrote a

2096
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:43,320
academic document towards the end of

2097
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,820
last year

2098
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,560
um this is this comment is mostly about

2099
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,540
with people saying how soon do we need

2100
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,540
it or not looking at the state of

2101
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,280
quantum computers when we need to worry

2102
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,199
about them specifically for cryptography

2103
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,060
such like that

2104
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,400
um I then wrote up a document if you

2105
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,620
want to look it up it's called octo031

2106
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:05,159
about post Quantum for the DNS just you

2107
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,620
know locally for the DNS but we do have

2108
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:10,080
both things where we use signatures and

2109
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,659
you know we run under TLS

2110
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,940
um I'm simply plugging those now for the

2111
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:18,420
people who say I you know like I've been

2112
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,060
following the news and I think quantum

2113
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,820
computers will be available when or not

2114
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,679
um there there is actually and there are

2115
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,120
plenty of other academics who are

2116
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,639
writing this up if you want that kind of

2117
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,560
thing to inform your decision on how

2118
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,719
quickly to go uh please look at the

2119
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:36,780
document or wrote or come talk to me or

2120
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,060
even better if you you know our academic

2121
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,159
look at Hillary's document it's very

2122
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,860
very you know it goes into great detail

2123
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,580
and such like that my personal belief is

2124
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,560
that you know especially for the people

2125
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,480
who aren't following in this competition

2126
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,760
when we say oh let's just start on the

2127
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,500
signatures now

2128
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,360
to me that's an indication you're not

2129
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,860
following in this competition because

2130
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,719
within this competition just came out

2131
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:03,120
saying is we have a much better idea

2132
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,040
about about the key exchange than we do

2133
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,960
about signatures and they pretty much

2134
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,679
punted signatures down the road uh to do

2135
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,560
it longer so my feeling is if you want

2136
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,120
to be doing something now you should be

2137
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,139
looking at the key exchange

2138
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,340
all right I want to make sure we also

2139
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,600
have an open mic we have a number of

2140
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,400
folks in the queue so I'm going to lock

2141
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,800
the queue after where we are now so next

2142
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,400
up uh Sophia your remote

2143
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,060
yes thank you so just to maybe uh

2144
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,380
comment on some of the comments that

2145
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,540
have been post so one of the things uh

2146
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,060
that was said is about indeed if quantum

2147
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,980
computers are coming and how urgently is

2148
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,960
indeed to migrate and it is true that

2149
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,639
the majority of the research that has

2150
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,739
been recently presented states that a

2151
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:48,239
quantum computer is not going to be

2152
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,100
coming sometime soon in the sense that

2153
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,600
it's not going to be available tomorrow

2154
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,940
but that doesn't mean that traffic is

2155
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,960
not

2156
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,940
um the traffic is not targeted meaning

2157
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,500
that someone could be recording right

2158
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,060
now the traffic and the menu that are

2159
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,679
powerful quantum computer comes

2160
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,320
available they will be able to decrypt

2161
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,480
that path traffic so it's not only about

2162
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,639
the future traffic but also about any of

2163
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,560
the past one so the threat is not only

2164
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,239
about the future but also anything of

2165
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,699
the past I really like some also some of

2166
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,040
the comments that were just stated that

2167
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,540
um this is not only about the

2168
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,280
cryptography itself but also how it

2169
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,080
integrates into the different protocols

2170
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,880
so the challenge that right now in this

2171
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,159
is is actually posing to us it's not

2172
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,900
about selecting an algorithm anymore

2173
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,699
specifically in the key exchange each

2174
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:31,739
part because this has already been a

2175
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:33,719
Sunday or at least it's a signal that

2176
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,040
there will be a standardization from

2177
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,800
these so if we just standardize at the

2178
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,260
IDF level the same algorithms we will

2179
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:41,880
just be repeating the same work that

2180
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,739
this is doing but the actual challenge

2181
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,780
is actually how to put in them into the

2182
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,820
networks and protocols some protocols

2183
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:49,020
will be easy

2184
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,940
um maybe on the case change part some

2185
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,440
authors might be much more difficult

2186
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,420
specifically the ones that deals with

2187
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,580
authentication so actually having a

2188
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:58,560
place where we can discuss how to tackle

2189
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,120
depending on the different protocols

2190
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,219
might be worth and as one of the people

2191
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:05,639
in the queue that I forgot said while

2192
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:07,320
this is very important but we should

2193
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,139
also not not do the work of just

2194
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:11,760
repeating what one working group is

2195
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,380
doing in adult day but actually have

2196
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,000
maybe a centralized place where we

2197
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,100
actually discussed so I do like awesome

2198
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,139
a lot of the idea of maybe having an

2199
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:22,020
iitf working group because this might be

2200
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,460
something that is more related to

2201
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,620
research but apply research in that it

2202
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:27,600
put it touches a lot of the networks and

2203
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,080
protocols

2204
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,340
thank you Florence

2205
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,060
um I think I'm going to basically agree

2206
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,040
with a lot of what Sophia just said um

2207
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,540
so yeah I'd like to Second the point or

2208
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,639
third I think now the point about there

2209
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,560
being value and having a central

2210
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,300
location to have these communication

2211
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,120
conversations so absolutely agree that

2212
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,460
the details of how Protocols are

2213
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,679
developed should be happening in TLS in

2214
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,400
ipsec wherever but at the minute it's

2215
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,199
all very distinct and so having some

2216
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,820
central place where we can learn from

2217
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,260
what's happened elsewhere what has and

2218
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,639
what hasn't worked would be really

2219
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:06,600
valuable

2220
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,300
I think the other kind of centralization

2221
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,699
angle of this is that there would be

2222
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:13,800
value in having a group that

2223
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,260
both kind of make sense to bring both

2224
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,540
the cryptographic expertise to and also

2225
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,820
the protocol expertise to

2226
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,019
um and this could be that place

2227
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,480
thanks John

2228
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,600
hi yeah I'm John Gray from entrust and

2229
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,300
I'm putting on my customer hat right now

2230
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,300
because that's an implementer of pki and

2231
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,179
cryptographic solutions we've been asked

2232
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,219
about the post Quantum area for many

2233
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:44,280
many years we've been prototyping not

2234
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,320
actually we started with signatures

2235
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,420
right because that's how pique sorry

2236
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,460
John can you get a little closer okay is

2237
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:53,040
that better okay sorry about that

2238
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,320
um yeah so as a putting on my customer

2239
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,659
hat I was saying that um we've been

2240
01:32:57,659 --> 01:33:00,659
prototyping pqi based Solutions with

2241
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:02,100
these post Quantum algorithms and

2242
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,679
especially signatures so I mean this is

2243
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:07,860
a very uh this isn't something that I

2244
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,960
think can wait any longer I mean it's

2245
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,480
it's something that comes up actually

2246
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:16,219
weekly for us so we've already

2247
01:33:16,219 --> 01:33:19,260
implemented certificates and have has

2248
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,880
customers actually wanting to use them

2249
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,159
so so I don't think it's the time to

2250
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:24,960
wait I think now that nist has actually

2251
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,900
come out with the what the first uh what

2252
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,159
they're going to standardize I think

2253
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:31,380
it's actually making it even more vital

2254
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,139
that this move forward so I just wanted

2255
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:35,699
to make that point

2256
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:36,900
thank you

2257
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,379
Ross

2258
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,060
so when we were faced with the

2259
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,840
transition from sha-1 to sha-256 it was

2260
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,820
me and Steve bellovan up there trying to

2261
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,920
figure out how to orchestrate that

2262
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,100
across a whole bunch of groups and the

2263
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,040
lesson learned there was you're wrong

2264
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,980
it's going to take way more than that

2265
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:05,520
okay uh we thought the transition would

2266
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,980
take five years

2267
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:11,280
there are still Corners today that are

2268
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,719
using child one

2269
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,739
so uh this is a much bigger more

2270
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:20,699
pervasive uh kind of a thing yes we have

2271
01:34:20,699 --> 01:34:23,340
time but we have to worry about the

2272
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:26,280
traffic if that's recorded today and

2273
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,620
broken when the quantum computer comes

2274
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:31,860
along what's the lifespan of your

2275
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:35,159
Children's Health Care records

2276
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,679
let's get started it's going to take a

2277
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,980
long time

2278
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,580
thanks

2279
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:47,239
Ecker

2280
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,320
yeah a few points

2281
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,040
um

2282
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,440
I mean first I think just like to get

2283
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,600
clear some like factual underbrush

2284
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,280
um like the signature stuff isn't ready

2285
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,920
I think we all know that and so like the

2286
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,900
best we can do really is like kind of

2287
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,980
like

2288
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,199
try to get the key to help with some

2289
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,520
stuff working in a reasonable way and

2290
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,020
then hope this stuff improves or people

2291
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:08,460
get a better understanding of it but

2292
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,900
like we saw a presentation TLS yesterday

2293
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,699
about like the size of signatures and

2294
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:13,560
it's just like it's going to be big

2295
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,580
problems right

2296
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:17,100
um so

2297
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,260
um I I

2298
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,239
I'm generally like synthetic to this

2299
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:22,739
argument that um you know doing

2300
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:23,940
something out of traffic protection is

2301
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,080
important because of the recording

2302
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,820
recording problem though I'd remind

2303
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,560
people like you know we've been sending

2304
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,880
this data for like 20 years with these

2305
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,080
algorithms so we already have like 20

2306
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,280
years this day of being transmitted

2307
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,780
around so like you know another 10

2308
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,760
minutes may not be a deal against the

2309
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,960
background a lot of people think but

2310
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,179
like it's still important to do

2311
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:41,460
um the

2312
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,500
um you know so so my argument is not

2313
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,840
that we should do nothing my argument is

2314
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,100
that we have a sort of limited amount of

2315
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,360
bandwidth in this organization and a

2316
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,380
number of people who know how to work

2317
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:51,000
with these algorithms who are which are

2318
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,619
new and have properties that are

2319
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:54,659
somewhat unfortunate in some ways and

2320
01:35:54,659 --> 01:35:57,659
that it would be good to like before we

2321
01:35:57,659 --> 01:35:58,920
try to generalize the problem try to

2322
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,900
actually solve the problem once or twice

2323
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,940
and I think we mostly sold I think TLS

2324
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,500
actually has gotten fairly far thanks to

2325
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,600
my my work but like Doug Stabila and

2326
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,040
people like that

2327
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,619
um and so like I just like to see us

2328
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:12,000
nail a couple of them down and then try

2329
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,440
to generalize out that'll mean that the

2330
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,360
things aren't uniform across the system

2331
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,619
um but like trying to make it uniform

2332
01:36:16,619 --> 01:36:18,239
will mean that the protocols that really

2333
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,739
do need it very very badly right now

2334
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:21,360
will not get it actually waiting for the

2335
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,199
uniformity so like I guess if people

2336
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,699
want to form like a working group to do

2337
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:27,840
this like I'm not going to like spend a

2338
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,980
lot of time working against it but like

2339
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:31,080
I don't want to hold up the work in TLS

2340
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:35,719
and ipsec and on lamps for that

2341
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:42,119
so thanks uh so that drains our cue on

2342
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:44,400
this particular topic we appreciate the

2343
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,960
community you know feedback the

2344
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,880
recurring thing you know we do here when

2345
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,380
we've asked this time and we've

2346
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:50,520
previously asked in this kind of

2347
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,860
temperature check there is this big kind

2348
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,960
of question on when we should act and

2349
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,000
what's appropriate to act on given the

2350
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,860
information that we have now so we're

2351
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,179
gonna have to kind of take this back and

2352
01:37:00,179 --> 01:37:01,739
kind of think through what that

2353
01:37:01,739 --> 01:37:03,000
practically means but we very much

2354
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,500
appreciate again being able to do this

2355
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,000
temperature track and it came up again

2356
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,100
in SEC dispatch

2357
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,320
okay so given where we are at the agenda

2358
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,659
we're gonna just transition to full-on

2359
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:15,540
open mic is there anything someone would

2360
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:19,040
like to come talk to us about

2361
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:28,400
going once

2362
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,860
going twice

2363
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:33,780
all right we very much appreciate you

2364
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,100
thank you so much for helping us

2365
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,540
dispatch all our items in the early

2366
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,219
session and for this conversation we

2367
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:40,199
just had in Sag to raise everyone's

2368
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:41,880
awareness we're gonna break early for

2369
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,219
lunch have a good rest of your ietf week

2370
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,800
yeah

2371
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,000
that's right

2372
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:00,980
I'll make sure

2373
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,980
yeah

2374
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,000
something with uh

2375
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:14,000
so if there's a refresh mechanism

2376
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,820
but you should check

2377
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,520
[Music]

2378
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:02,639
foreign

2379
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:35,239
all together

2380
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:06,020
I'm listening

2381
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,739
foreign

2382
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,040
thank you
