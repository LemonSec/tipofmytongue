specifications

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
we spent a lot of time working on it and

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
then sort of fizzled

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
uh what happened

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
we're looking for feedback

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,040
privately publicly

all of the

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
uh drafts off to the independent stream

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,879
editor

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,840
and alvaro comes up with uh

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
uh hi hello thunder rolling indy um just

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,959
to be clear uh

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
it is not an option for us to send

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
anything to the isc

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,680
that is a decision that the draft

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,959
authors will have to make if they want

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
to still publish the draft the decision

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
that we can make is

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
do we try adoption again do we just not

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,799
adopt them

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
but what happens after the working group

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
is something that we cannot decide

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
yes we can only

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
not

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
speaking as a member of the editor board

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
usually they will query me and say has

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
is the working group let go of this one

106

time slot at itf-114

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
tentatively we were thinking

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
we might hand hold an interim in august

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
on the 29th

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,400
to let those people talk if you are one

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
of those people who didn't manage to get

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
a time slot today

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,040
please let the chairs know or send a

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
note to g so we can determine if we

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
should schedule this

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
interim

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,440

let's not see me

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
hello everybody yeah this is an update

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
about the bgp extension for advertising

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
i feed capabilities that the draft has

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
been recently adopted

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
i'm giuseppe and i'm presenting on the

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
alpha quarter so next slide

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
just a few words about the background

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
and motivation so if it

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
uh stands for in c2 for information

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,840
telemetry and it's just an aim to refer

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
the data plane on path telemetry

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,759
techniques including

152
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
in situ im defined in the rfc 9197 and

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
alternate marking

154
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,520
defined in the rfc 83 21 and 88 89 and

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
we are currently working to the beast

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,479
document to elevate this methodology to

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
propose a standard

158
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
since these are solutions requiring into

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
limited domains

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
it is required that the ingress node

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,440
learn the effect capability supported by

162
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
the end node in order to avoid data

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,639
leaking from the domain

164
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
so uh in this way uh we need to define

165
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
an

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,360
a mechanism and an extension to bgp to

167
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
advertise the feed capabilities in this

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,199
way

169
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
the

170
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,039
the tail node can advertise this

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
information to the hand node

172
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
that can determine what are the i fit

173
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
option that can be encapsulated

174
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
the the typical scenario is the

175
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
distributed one so next slide

176
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
um so the

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
bgp next top capability attribute is

178
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
defined in

179
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,639
another document it is the next top

180
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,840
capability

181
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
draft

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
this next top capability is a

183
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
non-transitive bgp attribute

184
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
and the important characteristic is that

185
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
it is updated or deleted when the next

186
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
stop is changed

187
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
this is an important characteristic

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
because it guarantees for the limited

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
domain application that when the next

190
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
stop change

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,080
also the capability reflect the next

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
stop

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,599
the document define these newer fit

194
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
capabilities that can be encoded as a

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
next stop attribute

196
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
it is defined in 16 bit bitmap so five

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,039
bits have been defined

198
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
four are for the iom option type plants

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
and one info is for alternate marking

200
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,000
flats

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
when

202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
a specific flag is set this indicates

203
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,080
that the router can process the specific

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
method

205
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
next slide

206
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
this is just an example to how it works

207
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
for ifit domain application so when a

208
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
bgp speaker send an update

209
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
with the bgp next stop capability

210
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,599
attribute it may include the ifit

211
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
capability

212
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,760
these allow to advertise the supported

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
capabilities and in this way the a fit

214
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
encapsulating node is aware if the

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,680
capsulating node can process the

216
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,920
specific high feed

217
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
option

218
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,760
in case of multiple domain they can

219
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
still build

220
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
let's say a controller domain

221
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
and in this case the routing the router

222
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
reflector may also pass this information

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
between

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,560
different clusters to keep the effect

225
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
methods consistent between different

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,839
domains

227
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
next slide

228
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
yeah just few words about the the the

229
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,279
ongoing discussion

230
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,120
so during the adoption uh there were um

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
several comments that um

232
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
were already addressed in the latest

233
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
version in particular i want to

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
highlight that it has been clarified

235
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
that the only

236
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
solution in scope is the next stop

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
capability attribute

238
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
as since

239
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
it is a non-transitive attribute

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
while all the additional extended

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,839
community is no longer considered is the

242
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
current in the current version so it

243
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
may be discussed for

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
one of the next version or for a

245
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
separate document but

246
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
it is out of scope for now

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
uh also i want to thank you for opening

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,279
a discussion with the ippm working group

249
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,920
so we received also some feedback from

250
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,040
the ippm working group and

251
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,279
the this feedback will be addressed in

252
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,360
the next version in particular a

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
clarification about the use of the term

254
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,640
i fit

255
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,440
and

256
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
most important relationship with

257
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,880
draft in ippm about the iom conf state

258
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,920
so

259
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
it is a similar mechanism but it use

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
icmp v6 so we have to distinguish the

261
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,880
scenario when bgp is the best option and

262
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
other cases where icmpd6 can be used

263
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
next slide

264
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,519
i think is the last one so yeah

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
welcome question comments and thank you

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,319
i i see that i'm a bit out of time

267
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,399
okay thank you very much

268
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
all right uh

269
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,200
this is mahesh jaitanandani i'm here to

270
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
present a status on the bgp yang model

271
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
next slide please

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
all right the status with the dash 14

273
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,800
version of the draft

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
a lot of cleanup on the draft

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
mainly to move the

276
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
stats for total parts and prefixes into

277
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,800
its own container the stats container

278
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
and more importantly clean up the

279
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,399
use of counters and consistency in its

280
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
use

281
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,680
across the entire draft

282
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
we had multiple

283
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
definitions we were using

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,519
to clean that up

285
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
can i encourage the order of all the

286
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
features

287
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
but most importantly probably in the

288
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
draft itself was securing

289
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
the bgp session

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
so we had

291
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
i put forth the proposal

292
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,120
um

293
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,839
but

294
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,399
after looking at it the second time

295
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,800
we decided that we need to make changes

296
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
to the tcp yang model

297
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,279
and the changes for which were proposed

298
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,560
in tcp

299
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,440
by the way that model is an isc

300
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
discussion right now

301
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
and essentially that um

302
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,680
augments the keychain model and provides

303
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,399
the ability for bgp to just make a call

304
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,680
to say

305
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
uh that it wants to secure its the

306
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
particular session or not

307
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,519
the other was a redundant md5 auth

308
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
password that was just sitting around we

309
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
had not removed before

310
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,200
and the corresponding example for

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
how to authenticate a bgp session has

312
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,079
been updated in the appendix

313
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,160
the other major change

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,040
the

315
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,720
bgp types module now is an iona module

316
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
mainly we moved it to

317
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
make

318
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,519
provide the ability to update it easier

319
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
with an iona module

320
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,880
the other big change in the bgp module

321
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
is the addition of raw

322
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
to support new

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
and experimental extended communities

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
and that's by use of this particular

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
type string that i show on the screen

326
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
so essentially a pattern that is raw

327
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
colon followed by

328
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
up to eight octaves

329
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,000
any questions

330
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
if not i'll still take them at the end

331
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
next slide please

332
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
as far as issues are concerned we're

333
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
tracking them on that github link that i

334
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,399
show up there

335
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,199
as you see from the previous version we

336
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
have knocked off the major issues

337
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,160
related to extended communities

338
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
we are now down to

339
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,440
uh

340
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
issues related to policy configuration

341
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,639
and we need to do that clean up in the

342
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
in the next phase

343
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,599
next slide

344
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
so as i said next steps

345
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,600
we

346
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
believe that the policy configuration is

347
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
the last major issue we need to address

348
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,120
the rest of the cleanup is mostly

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
editorial

350
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
that we need to take care of

351
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,760
and then we hope that we have the

352
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
draft ready for publication

353
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
by ietf 115

354
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,199
thank you

355
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,479
any questions

356
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
nope

357
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,479
i think next presentations again

358
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
hi my name is

359
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
my name is gion mishra i'm with verizon

360
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,480
and i will be presenting this

361
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,360
draft um

362
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
on behalf of co-authors so the draft is

363
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
connecting ipv4 islands over an ipv6

364
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,079
core for pe

365
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,959
um next slide

366
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
so the motivation for this draft is so

367
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
an idf standard exists for connecting

368
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,000
ipv6 islands over an ipv4 core

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
everyone's pretty familiar with that rfc

370
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,880
4798 however standard does not exist for

371
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
connecting ipv4 islands over an ipv6

372
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,759
core so this draft provides a

373
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
specification for connecting ipv4 albums

374
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,560
over an ipv6 core

375
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
as i as operators migrate to a single

376
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
vertical ipv6 only core

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
you know per rfc 5565 software mesh

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
framework involves you know six to four

379
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
tunneling of six packets

380
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
over a four core

381
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
called 6p now with this draft a similar

382
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
four to six tunnel of ipv4 package over

383
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
over an ipv6 core can now can now

384
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
be uh instantiated now called 4pe the

385
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
name for 6pu is termed that way for

386
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,240
tunneling ipv6 labeled packets over ipv4

387
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
and now similarly with 4p the term finds

388
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,959
the tunneling of ipv4 packets over a

389
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,639
ipv6 core next slide

390
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,360
so for pe architecture and overview so

391
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
4p roughly it so

392
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
sorry 4p routers exchange ipv4

393
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,000
reachability transparently tunneled over

394
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,040
an ipv6 core using multi-particle bgp

395
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,480
rfc 2545 using bgp next stop field

396
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
conveyed

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
conveyed conveying the ipv6 address to

398
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
the 4pe router so that the dynamically

399
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,439
established ipv6 signaled lsp can be can

400
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
be utilized without explicit tunnel

401
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,039
configuration so this is basically the

402
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
say the uh signaling the top most

403
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
transport label and then 4p uses rfc 85

404
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,199
it uses rrc 8950 next hop encoding 16 or

405
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,199
32 by next top for a ipv6 address slash

406
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
link local address ingress and eager sp

407
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,760
routers must bind the labeled

408
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,559
label to all ipv4 presses bgplu rfc 8277

409
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
and then four pe supports explicit null

410
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,559
signaling for disk serve pipe mode a

411
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,799
model um rfc 3270 and then 4p supports

412
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,080
rfc 4364 nras options a b

413
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,919
cnab as well as 4p design as well

414
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,039
supports

415
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
three data planes supports mpls srm pls

416
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,559
and srv6 next slide

417
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
so this is a just a graphical depiction

418
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
so this is with six pe so basically you

419
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
have really there's there's two main

420
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
components one is signaling this the

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
transport layer transport lsp over an

422
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
mpls core and that's that's shown

423
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,720
signaling from the

424
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
ingress pe to the egress pe uh building

425
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,039
that lsp and then bgplu labeling the

426
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,160
ipv6 prefixes all prefixes that are

427
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
advertised from the cdp

428
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
labeling them with six for six on the 6p

429
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
router uh propagated uh the control

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
plane propagated from ingress to egress

431
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
next slide

432
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,880
so with four pe similarly and an mpl

433
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
scored the egress ingress pe signals and

434
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,000
and establishes a transport lsp an ipv6

435
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
lsp across the ipv6 core

436
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
and then as well

437
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,360
the service service label bottom of

438
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,520
stack bgplu all the v4 prefixes are have

439
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,480
a label binding and and advertised

440
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
across the control plane from ingress p

441
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
to eager spe

442
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
next slide

443
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,520
similarly with srm pls

444
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
if you have let's say a centralized

445
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
controller where you're uh building the

446
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
um

447
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,600
srte uh path

448
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
instantiating that path uh to your

449
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,679
egress pe

450
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,400
your transport would be built across the

451
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
core from ingress to egress

452
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
to your to your node sid on the egress

453
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
side and then your vpns your bottom of

454
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,160
stack service label with bgplu that

455
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
piece all remains the same there's

456
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
no change from mpls to srm pls just the

457
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,640
transport piece changes next slide

458
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,640
with srv6

459
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
rfc 9252

460
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
bgp srv6 services bgp prefix sit

461
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
attribute so here the srl sr v6 l3

462
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
service tlv uh bgp label transposition

463
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
so this is where the transposition

464
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
happens to the function slash argument

465
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,159
field so that's defined in section 5.3

466
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,200
in in that in that our in that rfc

467
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
and then um

468
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
rfc

469
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,039
8986 the r76 programming draft section

470
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,679
4.7

471
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
uh

472
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
i'm not i'm out of pine okay all right

473
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
so so basically here the the transport

474
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,640
labels is built the controller uh

475
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
instantiates the transport uh

476
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
tran transport path across the core and

477
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
then the vpn service the bottom of stack

478
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
service labels are basically is exactly

479
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
the same as the uh

480
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
mpls as as well as srm pls the binding

481
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,000
bgp lu for the control plane uh binding

482
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
of all the v4 prefixes across the core

483
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,440
um we can just go to the last slide

484
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
just yeah called it at the last slide

485
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
so i'm so i'd like to solicit the idr

486
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
workgroup for uh feedback and comments

487
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,240
on the draft and thank you very much

488
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,280
thanks

489
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,080
thank you very much

490
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
okay um

491
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,799
dj will you test your mic before we

492
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,840
begin

493
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
and colorado nats if you would come to

494
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,520
the front

495
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
okay

496
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
i'm gonna start talking while you move

497
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
okay this is the summation ah

498
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,520
gotta get the house how's the sound okay

499
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
folks

500
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,679
okay thank you very much jeff and the

501
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,720
rest

502
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
the car uh ct adoption call uh our

503
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,080
presentation is from

504
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,840
dj and colorads and nats i don't swadesh

505
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
may add in go ahead jeff

506
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
so

507
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
the adoption call went from just after

508
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,919
july 6 to july 27th we had a tremendous

509
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
amount of people

510
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
respond lots of wonderful input

511
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,760
and

512
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
about

513
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
last week i sort of summarized what i'm

514
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,760
going to say next that the chairs were

515
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
heading toward the idr wiki has

516
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
summaries and notes i because it was a

517
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
lot of input i wrote up notes

518
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
you can find that on the idr wiki go

519
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
ahead

520
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,600
one thing that really helped us is we've

521
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
got a lot of input and detailed input

522
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
from folks

523
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
who were

524
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
customer support people and we use that

525
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,159
to gauge customer and we had a lot of

526
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
really

527
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,039
off channel and on channel input from

528
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,760
operators what we're going toward is

529
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
maybe not a perfect

530
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
solution but we're going to take the two

531
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,918
drafts is on the experimental track

532
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,159
and we'll generate as a working group an

533
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,440
interoperability document between the

534
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
two

535
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
why did we go that the customers we talk

536
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
to convince the chairs that the

537
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,720
technology is needed in the field

538
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
therefore the interoperability between

539
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
car and cts seem to be less

540
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
important than deploying the code

541
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,360
the working group will need to do

542
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
substantial work to turn the drafts to

543
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
rfc quality

544
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
there is a concern

545
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
that

546
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
we need to make sure the error

547
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,320
handling's well done and that everything

548
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,120
is specified for the environments it's

549
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
going to go to

550
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,200
now the benefit that i've asked the

551
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,480
authors to provide is i've asked them to

552
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
describe some of their

553
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,799
deployment use cases and that's not all

554
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
the possible ones but i've asked them to

555
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
pick up one or two

556
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,400
the ex one question i've had from

557
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
several people is how do you go from

558
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
experimental to propose

559
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
well after you

560
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,840
revise and get that critical customer

561
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
feedback because you've been in the

562
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,720
field we can revise the draft or say

563
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
perhaps that it's perfect

564
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,640
and turn it into proposed now

565
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
i must suspect that

566
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
alvaro and other isg members would like

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
to see an interoperability between these

568
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,679
two drafts

569
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,960
and as always it is an idr draft so it

570
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
will be two implementations

571
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,320
at this point we believe we will request

572
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
two implementations for each draft but

573
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
again we will take this to the working

574
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,600
group

575
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,880
now for our topics for this conversation

576
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,960
we're going to go through the customer

577
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
examples

578
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
uh the issues that were raised on part

579
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,480
three of the adoption call the car next

580
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,880
steps that is what things they'd like

581
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
you to help them with to refine their

582
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,880
draft the ct and then i'll briefly tell

583
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,520
you where we are with the

584
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,440
interoperability documents start

585
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,480
so we'll start first with dj go ahead dj

586
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
you should be

587
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
seeing your slide in front of you thanks

588
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,480
to jeff

589
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,120
thank you sue uh can you hear me okay

590
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
yes i can

591
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,279
sure thank you um so i i'll do a brief

592
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,919
overview of a fairly typical deployment

593
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,120
scenario

594
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
this is not tied to a specific customer

595
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
i mean we generalized it and

596
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
in general the pattern you know repeats

597
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
across many customers that are you know

598
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,120
looking at this

599
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,400
solution

600
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,640
um so this base use case is for

601
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,600
establishing you know different multiple

602
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
intent aware paths to a specific uh

603
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,960
router in the network most likely uh pe

604
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,159
you know the pe loopback and the

605
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
the the plu bag is actually the bgp next

606
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,360
hop of a service so obviously the

607
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
service can be l3 vpn in many cases uh

608
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
and often it is the global table and

609
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,840
then also you know more uh

610
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,279
recently evpn so these are the typical

611
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,360
cases that we have from a service point

612
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,320
of view

613
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,559
um and when it comes to intent again

614
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,520
there's different types of intent

615
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
that we are you know seeing

616
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,240
uh you know likely there's obviously low

617
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,559
latency uh we have

618
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,279
avoidance is a you know popular you know

619
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,600
use case uh there's you know things like

620
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
diverse paths etc

621
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
um so most of these fall into the same

622
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
you know pattern that you you know for a

623
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
pe you can have more than one intent at

624
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
the same time uh you know where you need

625
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
colorado paths and you know we need to

626
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
support that across

627
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
a multi-domain you know environment

628
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,200
where bgp is used uh again i've shown a

629
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
single you know simple topology uh but

630
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,640
in reality we do see you know variations

631
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
uh you know both multi-as and uh

632
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,120
multi-igp

633
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,200
um and then again you know for the

634
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
purpose of this talk i you know just the

635
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
you know a common case that we see you

636
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
know

637
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
in many scenarios where

638
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,039
uh we have igp flex algo being enabled

639
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
in the uh you know in the respective

640
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,480
domains for providing the intra-domain

641
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
intent but again there is variation

642
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,440
there uh in you know cases where we have

643
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
uh existing networks we see things like

644
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,159
rsvpte

645
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,799
uh in some cases we even have you know

646
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,320
need to go over a bgpalu island so you

647
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
know in general all these cases are

648
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,320
covered in the draft uh but you know

649
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,720
here i just picked uh sort of one you

650
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,600
know sort of uh

651
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
simple scenario

652
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,240
next slide please

653
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,919
um another you know

654
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,640
case uh which sort of details into the

655
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
one that we you know saw earlier is in

656
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,159
in the multi-domain environment we uh

657
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
very often have the case where

658
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
um not all domains have the same number

659
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,840
of

660
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,399
colors or you know intents uh that's

661
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,320
what we you know refer to in the bgp

662
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
card draft as the n is to m mapping uh

663
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,520
so you know here we see a very typical

664
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,559
example

665
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,080
where uh in the core you can have uh

666
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
more you know colors so you know shown

667
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
four in this example whereas on the axis

668
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,799
you have fewer you know say two but now

669
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,120
this is really decoupled from the what's

670
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,360
needed end to end between the uh you

671
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,720
know between say a pair of pes so again

672
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
as you see in this example there's

673
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,159
four colors c1 c2 c3 and c4 for uh you

674
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
know specific uh you know egress v e3

675
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
when those routes go across this

676
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,080
multi-domain network they do need to map

677
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,399
to the respective you know one of the

678
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,799
available intra-domain intents

679
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,399
and and that

680
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,679
is handled in bgp car by leveraging the

681
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
same you know mechanism that we have for

682
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
self steering today where the color

683
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,919
extended community is used to steer

684
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,919
service routes through a particular

685
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,399
color aware transport path the same way

686
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
when it comes down to this second layer

687
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
of resolution a color external community

688
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,000
on the bgp car route um allows for you

689
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
know resolution into a specific intra

690
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,120
domain intent uh again the details are

691
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
in the in the draft

692
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,320
uh next next slide please

693
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,799
um now here we have a slightly different

694
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
uh case where instead of having a color

695
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,919
aware path to a specific uh you know

696
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
router uh what we have here is um

697
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
traffic that needs to be

698
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,159
you know

699
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
sent across one of a set of nodes you

700
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,559
know that offer uh a kind of any cast

701
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,559
you know service so here instead of it

702
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,640
being single you know p loop back ip

703
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,159
here we have a

704
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,880
an anycast ip and you know color that

705
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
goes along with it that's advertised by

706
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
a set of nodes which can be in the same

707
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,679
or multiple

708
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,799
domains

709
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,520
um and in terms of traffic forwarding

710
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,919
you know to from different ingress nodes

711
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,640
to uh you know this uh these set of

712
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
nodes um the base scenario is where you

713
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,480
have the network providing and any cast

714
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
forwarding uh mechanism where traffic

715
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
goes to the nearest set of nodes uh in

716
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,000
this example we have traffic from e11

717
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
uh landing on uh the nodes in you know

718
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,159
domain four

719
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,840
whereas uh you know the traffic from um

720
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,640
uh e to one uh being load balanced

721
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
across the the nodes in domain you know

722
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,520
five and six is just an illustration

723
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,480
um

724
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
again there is there are variations here

725
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
one you know typical variation is where

726
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,039
um it is the

727
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,200
ingress pe which you know does the

728
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
explicit load balancing across the set

729
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,640
of available you know egress domains

730
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,240
um one thing to mention is uh in in this

731
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
sort of case it's the expectation is

732
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
that any of these nodes that receive the

733
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,799
traffic are capable of forwarding the

734
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,120
um the actual you know payload uh most

735
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
more likely

736
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,360
uh a sort of a global table

737
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,679
uh you know a distant

738
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,240
uh again this is just a you know quick

739
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,480
snapshot of a few of the common use

740
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,880
cases that we are you know seeing in the

741
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,120
customers that we are you know

742
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,559
interacting with

743
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,559
uh thank you very much

744
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,559
again details are in the card

745
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
oh hi i'm kali raj

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
so sir

747
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,000
hold it

748
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
hello yup

749
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,760
so we are going to describe the use

750
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,640
cases that we are seeing for bgpct and

751
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,840
these are um a few use cases which can

752
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,640
be

753
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
classified as the

754
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
um basically whatever use case we are

755
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,799
seeing we just classified a few types of

756
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,519
them

757
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
and we have

758
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
listed the customers in some cases

759
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,679
wherever it's possible

760
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
so this is the first use case where you

761
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,039
see

762
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,679
two domains which are using their own

763
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
intra domain transfer protocols and

764
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,519
these are like existing deployments

765
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,600
which may use like rsvp in both the

766
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
domains and some of them may be uh

767
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,200
moving to srt in some of the domains so

768
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,120
this is a typical deployment scenario

769
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
that we are seeing where

770
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
customers want to offer end-to-end sla

771
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,200
and bgpct is able to help them with this

772
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
so

773
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
this is an example where one of the

774
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,000
domains is moving from rsvp to srt but

775
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
you can also imagine the other customers

776
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,159
who are rsvp everywhere and they want to

777
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,480
stay like that and the solution works

778
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
for that as well

779
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,720
next slide please

780
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,640
so this is another example where

781
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,480
the flow based

782
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,519
forwarding that using bgp flow spec

783
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
if they want to be given a certain sla

784
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
and how does that work

785
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,000
so we just have the service chain

786
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
element that is being

787
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,880
advertised in bgpct uh with a different

788
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,000
transport class and those transport

789
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
classes they resolve over the tc100

790
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,559
tunnels that are there in the core

791
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
and the bgp flow spec routes they just

792
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
carry the redirect to ip

793
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,360
next hop with the transport

794
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,559
class so with with a color and that

795
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
allows them to resolve the flow spec

796
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
route over the certain transport class

797
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,880
which can be rsvp srt or any any kind of

798
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,919
tunnel again

799
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,679
so this is just a typical flow spec

800
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,600
example which carries

801
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
the color community and it's able to

802
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,640
put traffic over a certain sla

803
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,360
next slide please

804
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
so this is um just an example of a

805
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,799
customer input on idr that

806
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,720
explains why

807
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,440
heterogeneous color mapping is a reality

808
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,960
in today's networks and also

809
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
non-agreeing color domains are reality

810
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,000
in today's network

811
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,799
and any solution needs to cater to both

812
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,518
next site please

813
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,599
so

814
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,599
if you think about it the the flowspec

815
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,918
example or this non-agreeing color

816
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,639
domain and heterogeneous color example

817
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,800
so we the bjpct

818
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
solution it just has base transport

819
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,359
tunnels which are of a certain color and

820
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,440
it automatically creates the resolution

821
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,918
schemes for that color color 100 in this

822
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,159
example and whenever you have another

823
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
color route like 101 102 in the flow

824
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,918
spec example or this compound color in

825
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,040
100 200 in this example um

826
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,119
we will just map it using custom

827
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,960
resolution schemes to the transport

828
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
tunnels that are available the transport

829
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
colors that are available in that domain

830
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,719
so the service routes or the other

831
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
transport routes they can resolve using

832
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,839
custom resolution schemes through the

833
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,320
transport terminal so this is overall

834
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,079
how the whole bgbct thing works

835
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,599
i think that was the end of the slides

836
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,839
okay then it's my turn

837
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,960
there are issues that you will have uh

838
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,079
seen

839
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,560
on the third part of the adoption call

840
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,200
we tried to keep the adoption call

841
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
with imp uh requesting information

842
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,320
requesting call

843
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,480
for adoption and then

844
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
issues with either draft

845
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
so you will note

846
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,880
on the left hand side cars issues

847
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
and ct's issues

848
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,839
up to the line are the same they're

849
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,280
various questions that work for it below

850
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,920
that the authors

851
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,960
have

852
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,119
slightly different issues

853
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,640
i'm not going to read through all the

854
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,800
issues so that you can ask questions

855
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,839
later

856
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,000
but i am going to tell you that's the

857
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
sort of breakdown and so the authors are

858
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,680
going to tell you which of their issues

859
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,960
they'd like help with first dj it's your

860
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
turn as we turn to the next slide

861
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,760
oh thank you um so in general we have

862
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
gotten

863
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
a good amount of feedback from various

864
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,320
collaborators on and off the list and

865
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,520
you know

866
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
that has helped the

867
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,119
the you know the car document to get to

868
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,200
the current version um

869
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,079
um

870
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,160
you know again we would uh you know

871
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,920
request wider uh you know review uh and

872
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,079
and feedback on the current version

873
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,960
um

874
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,760
and

875
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
at the same time there are certain you

876
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,800
know areas that we intend to update on

877
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,640
the uh you know in the next couple of

878
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,240
versions so a couple of key ones being

879
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
detailing the srv6 related flows and

880
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,200
some considerations uh and then updates

881
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,119
on the filtering mechanisms

882
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,599
to be used for bgp car

883
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,160
um so we you know again request

884
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,839
you know folks to

885
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,119
help with that

886
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,599
and also provide you know additional

887
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,160
input on other use case scenarios to

888
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
make the draft complete

889
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,560
thank you

890
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,800
that's

891
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
am i audible

892
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,839
yeah first of all thanks for

893
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,040
watching sure

894
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
first of all thanks for uh

895
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
adopting bgbct and my best wishes to php

896
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,599
card team as well

897
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
so the first things we need help with is

898
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,599
to

899
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,160
clarify text for disallowing srv6

900
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,359
transposition

901
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,280
for sophie 76

902
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,680
so this is

903
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,359
something that we will do in the next

904
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,440
four months

905
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,320
and

906
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
the next one is text clarification for

907
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,599
section 8 for usage of rd there has been

908
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
some back and forth on part 3 about this

909
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,839
and

910
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,680
we have taken an action item to clearly

911
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
list

912
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
the flexibility of using the same rd

913
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
versus unicardi and the different label

914
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,320
allocation modes that are available in

915
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,839
bgpct

916
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
so to address all the scenarios that

917
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
have been pointed out in part three

918
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,680
then uh

919
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,440
there is there is a point about uh

920
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,680
expressing uh and processing customer

921
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,480
intent which is on the cep links

922
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,200
so which is uh uh analogous to

923
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
vpn car

924
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,000
uh so here we have to add text for

925
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,760
control plane as well as data bring

926
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
procedures control plane procedures are

927
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
for

928
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,440
mapping signaling the customer entrant

929
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
from cpe

930
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,960
some p to c and then the data plane

931
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
procedures to map

932
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,599
uh

933
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,400
the customer intent coming from the ce

934
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
on to the pe

935
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
so this uh

936
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
the idea is to actually not use a new

937
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,320
fisafi

938
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,200
but uh handle it within the attributes

939
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,520
and for the use cases that we have

940
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,760
projected a little earlier

941
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,119
we'd be uh

942
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,800
we have some backup slides to explain

943
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
those use cases in details so if you do

944
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,520
want to take a look at those use cases

945
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,400
uh

946
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
yeah please help yourself

947
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,599
uh

948
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,000
i think that's about it

949
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,359
thank you matt um okay the

950
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,720
interoperability document

951
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
we're going to look to see if we can

952
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,960
find a path to interoperable

953
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,359
features or our big picture questions

954
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,680
that we received input on

955
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,680
what's a color for color in the nri not

956
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,520
in the nri

957
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,920
impact of packing and translation now

958
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,640
this to me is an important piece because

959
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
the use cases

960
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,960
suggest they will be used in

961
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,400
some

962
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,160
5g network so packing and packing

963
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,119
is important both in the nri and in the

964
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,400
attributes

965
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
my big

966
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,760
desire is to see strong error handling

967
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,480
and to have the working group talk about

968
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
error handling when you have a lot of

969
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,079
attributes and a lot of non-key

970
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,560
fields in the nri

971
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,640
so i expect to continue my

972
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,880
warm debates with the authors on

973
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,560
on air handling

974
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,160
there's places in each graft

975
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,119
in

976
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,920
car and in ct where we want to make sure

977
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,319
we tie down filtering and how to talk

978
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,560
about different filtering

979
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,760
what i heard from some of the

980
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,000
providers is their need for filtering or

981
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,800
aggregation in their policies

982
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,480
even in the color

983
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
situation the expression

984
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,800
of transport intent as inter asbpn

985
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,160
you will note we had discussions on

986
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,800
type a type b and type c

987
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
we'll need to talk about this as a

988
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
working group to sort of set our bar for

989
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
this upcoming

990
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,560
set of work now uh today a couple

991
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,119
authors told me that they had a color

992
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,640
draft for

993
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
srv6

994
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
that's nice but we need to guide this

995
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,599
work in one way

996
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,760
jeff would you go to the next slide

997
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,640
please thank you okay just to show you

998
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
some of the challenges

999
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
uh jeff

1000
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,720
i've stole this from jeff because he did

1001
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
a lot of the foundational work

1002
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,439
for

1003
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,240
the chairs determining that these are

1004
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,720
functionally equivalent i don't think

1005
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,079
the call has changed our attitude at all

1006
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
that these are functionally equivalent

1007
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,400
and operationally different so take a

1008
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,440
look this is eye candy or study it

1009
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
this is the car

1010
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
and lcm community

1011
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
go ahead to the next this is the ct

1012
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
lry and transport

1013
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,359
community

1014
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,160
extended community we will need to talk

1015
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,520
about how interoperability works

1016
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
as a working group

1017
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
these are now

1018
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,440
going to become working group documents

1019
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,359
and we will work on them

1020
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,000
there are implementations

1021
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
in play

1022
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
so folks that's the end of our

1023
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,440
presentation as it's been a

1024
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
active working group

1025
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,839
adoption call now is the time for

1026
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,920
questions online

1027
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,200
or in person if you would

1028
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,359
step to one of the two mics

1029
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,079
and let us know if we can provide you

1030
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,880
more details

1031
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,359
security compelling please go ahead

1032
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,400
greedy

1033
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,200
um so you said in the

1034
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
preamble

1035
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,200
that deployment is more important than

1036
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,040
interpret interoperability at this point

1037
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,960
but you talk about the interoperability

1038
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
document is it not important

1039
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,200
to give a deployment experience after a

1040
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,720
while to say

1041
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,480
you know is it fit for purpose for

1042
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,880
whatever people want to do with it

1043
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,839
is it easy to use is easy to work with

1044
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,640
and also on the implementation side

1045
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
or are we just gonna straight go

1046
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
straight to interoperability so let me

1047
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,480
rephrase frame your question if i may to

1048
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,880
make sure i understand it first you're

1049
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,920
asking

1050
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,160
should we define what

1051
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,280
it

1052
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,800
is supposed to do as well as

1053
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,960
interoperability

1054
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
and that's a really good question here's

1055
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,839
the reason we hadn't

1056
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,680
charged uh with both feet into that

1057
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,880
direction

1058
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,119
is that spring is working on something

1059
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,359
in this area and

1060
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,400
there is still at the individual draft

1061
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,040
so we're sort of waiting to see it does

1062
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,480
have input

1063
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,640
from both sets of authors

1064
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,480
so at that point

1065
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,240
once we see

1066
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,400
another round of the spring discussion

1067
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,800
we'll pick up do we need a new one

1068
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,760
do we need to refine it or do we just

1069
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,520
reference it i mean

1070
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
why we do work in this environment so

1071
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
that's that's where we are we're sort of

1072
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,760
waiting

1073
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,920
input from the working group is helpful

1074
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,280
okay

1075
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,839
make sense

1076
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,800
i don't see anybody in the queue

1077
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,079
folks after all the talking on the mail

1078
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,520
list have we

1079
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,079
run out of steem grady thank you for

1080
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,359
being

1081
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,680
asking one of the really good questions

1082
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,440
that that

1083
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
excellent question

1084
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,800
probably should have put it in my notes

1085
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
but excellent because we need to know

1086
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,000
where we're going the adoption calls

1087
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,200
were like

1088
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,760
taking a term paper

1089
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,119
because we need to know where we're

1090
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,440
going

1091
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,480
any more questions to those

1092
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,640
in the online

1093
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,640
scenario

1094
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,119
so the slides do have a large number of

1095
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,960
backup items in there you know you're

1096
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,480
strongly encouraged to take a look

1097
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
through the additional content that's

1098
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,400
going to be available

1099
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
these are things that the car and the ct

1100
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,560
authors have in some cases previously

1101
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,720
submitted but it helps expand the

1102
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,839
scenarios

1103
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,480
and clearly the the authors are still on

1104
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,920
the mailing list paying attention to the

1105
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,440
various threads

1106
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,079
i think that the core three question

1107
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,560
threads have come to conclusion at this

1108
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,440
point

1109
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
so please feel free to start completely

1110
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,960
separate threads

1111
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,599
you're absolutely encouraged to ask hard

1112
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,359
questions technically

1113
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,440
you're also required to be respectful as

1114
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,800
part of those questions and they'll

1115
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,480
stick to technical observations

1116
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
and

1117
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,440
go ahead and queue up to the mic and

1118
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,520
i'm going to make one comment thank you

1119
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,880
for everyone

1120
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
during the last

1121
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,560
couple weeks when i said please move to

1122
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,599
four and three in technical questions we

1123
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,160
will probably for this topic

1124
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,040
try to have the level of detail that we

1125
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,520
had in forum three if you have any

1126
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,359
questions on

1127
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,520
how to do that just drop a note to the

1128
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,440
chairs we'll be glad to help you go

1129
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
ahead grady

1130
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,839
hi kiriti compiler so um

1131
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,839
the interoperability

1132
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,640
report is there an implication by having

1133
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,760
that that

1134
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,720
eventually both will become standards or

1135
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,359
are we even thinking is am i

1136
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,760
jumping the gun on that is one going to

1137
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
become a standard and one going to go

1138
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,000
away

1139
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,440
so creedy

1140
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,760
if i had all of those answers i would

1141
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,040
have given them

1142
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,280
the answer is i'm taking them forward to

1143
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,200
i've listened to the customers and

1144
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,839
they've said what i

1145
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,359
reported i

1146
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,680
believe that these folks will take their

1147
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,800
thing all the way to experimental this

1148
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,200
some questions have been how is there a

1149
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
quick term from experimental to proposed

1150
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,760
probably

1151
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,480
because these are fairly well developed

1152
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,760
works

1153
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,599
the experimental is because i wasn't

1154
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,920
as the chair who is um neutral

1155
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
chartered with shepherding this i

1156
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
couldn't see where we really had

1157
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,599
uh

1158
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,319
enough clear consensus

1159
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,400
one way or the other i think if you

1160
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
watch the list in my reports you'll saw

1161
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,839
that

1162
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,640
it it isn't clear one way or the other

1163
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,160
but the customers really said

1164
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,640
in each of the cases i really want that

1165
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,800
and we've had dual

1166
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,040
setups in fact you saw

1167
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,079
a couple of the customers say please do

1168
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,960
exactly what i did

1169
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,000
i'm going to wait and see my attitude on

1170
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,480
many of this is i think the hardest

1171
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,119
thing is scaling in error-free

1172
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,280
code in this point

1173
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,640
and i think early customer deployments

1174
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,160
from people who've said they were going

1175
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,720
to do it will teach us a lot

1176
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,079
i hope we

1177
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,400
my goal is always to come out with one

1178
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,480
single solution whether i'm going to get

1179
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,880
that in this place

1180
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,079
we're going to see what the working

1181
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,319
group says and that's

1182
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,480
that's my best as a sheriff or chair

1183
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,520
anything else guys

1184
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,680
so greedy partially to your point you

1185
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,079
know we have more than one place in ietf

1186
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,240
where more than one technology has come

1187
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,680
out covering a given space you know we

1188
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,760
have examples that multicast we have you

1189
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,319
know examples in l2 as you're aware of

1190
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,079
and what we're probably looking at uh

1191
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,599
you know is what the interrupt probably

1192
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,040
means in the short term is how do you

1193
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,720
make these technologies

1194
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
interact together in the same network so

1195
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
customers can solve their problems when

1196
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
you know one solution may be appropriate

1197
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
and you know the solution is appropriate

1198
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
for different spot

1199
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,160
so that's that's the short-term goal if

1200
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,640
it turns out that uh we eventually

1201
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,319
converge on when solutions appropriate

1202
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,839
for everything that's how this will

1203
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,079
settle out okay so long as you're not

1204
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,160
anticipating that's

1205
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,520
we don't know okay thanks

1206
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,559
we have quite a list

1207
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,240
actually add a question and then vim

1208
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,880
so guys uh

1209
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,200
uh properness shortness in the question

1210
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,880
would be helpful

1211
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,440
i i just had a quick question i was

1212
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,520
wondering i guess with the

1213
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,040
interoperability would that be something

1214
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,720
that would be added to the existing

1215
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,040
drafts i guess and made part of the spec

1216
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
or would would we would there be like a

1217
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,680
third draft i guess that would talk to

1218
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,240
interoperability

1219
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,920
um diane

1220
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,520
i would love to

1221
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
we'll have to see i

1222
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,680
i don't normally like to come to this

1223
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,359
position but

1224
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,359
i need to see from customers that i need

1225
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,920
to see from deployments

1226
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,440
i

1227
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,119
we'll see

1228
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,040
wish i had a better answer

1229
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,880
and i guess it's possible that i think

1230
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,200
as you go through the experimental

1231
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,359
and as both solutions are quite

1232
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,640
different that that um

1233
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,880
you know even though we want but if

1234
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,280
there's if the interoperability is not

1235
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,079
uh

1236
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,119
feasible

1237
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,800
would they just still both be able to

1238
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,359
progress i guess to rfc

1239
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,680
i i'll repeat the thing we think it's

1240
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,079
functionally equivalent right if that

1241
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,240
should mean that we have it but will we

1242
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,160
have it don't know right why don't you

1243
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,079
let them ask this question diane and

1244
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,000
i'll be glad to take more offline all

1245
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,800
right i apologize for the delay

1246
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,079
yeah remembering

1247
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,839
uh yeah

1248
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,960
i

1249
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,040
find the process a little bit strange if

1250
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,839
i'm honest because if we seek for

1251
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,599
feedback from operators who are going to

1252
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,720
deploy experimentally

1253
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,280
which operator is going to try both do

1254
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,880
we have one that is going to do that

1255
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,119
because what i my fear is what will

1256
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,920
happen is operator a deploys a and he

1257
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
will say i want a operator b deploys b

1258
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
and he will say i want b

1259
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,400
and we will not going to come to a

1260
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,040
conclusion on converging towards a

1261
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,520
single solution i'm afraid i share your

1262
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,640
fear

1263
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,280
and i hope to see something different

1264
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,720
but

1265
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,160
i decided should i would personally like

1266
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,599
one solution

1267
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,200
but

1268
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,839
exactly so so here's my proposal is

1269
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,920
there no way like to

1270
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
basically come up with a let's say

1271
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,000
independent team

1272
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,240
which basically take people from the

1273
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,319
various solutions in it

1274
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,640
and try to come to a convert solution

1275
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,240
rather than what we are doing right now

1276
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,079
because i feel that we are not

1277
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,160
converging because if you talk about

1278
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,240
interop if you look to both of the

1279
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,000
things although they try to achieve the

1280
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,200
same thing

1281
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,200
they are incompatible right now so the

1282
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,520
way to do interop is you have to deploy

1283
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,400
a gateway it converge from a to b

1284
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,079
and that's going to be interoperability

1285
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,359
if i'm honest

1286
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,040
and

1287
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,319
that's i fear that we are i will end up

1288
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,000
if we continue down this path we'll end

1289
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
up deploying both and we will have to

1290
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,240
proceed with both because to be honest

1291
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,640
if i'm an operator i'm not right

1292
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,680
if i deploy a in my live network

1293
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,400
i'm not going to change to b

1294
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
i will keep a

1295
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,200
and that's a bit the fear i have with

1296
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,400
the with

1297
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,319
uh the proposal that we have or the

1298
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,400
consensus that we uh reached here today

1299
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,000
in the work group i don't know what

1300
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,839
other things but that's my personal view

1301
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,480
i i personally share your

1302
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,200
your fears

1303
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,680
thank you thank you very much to all the

1304
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,520
participants

1305
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,480
uh

1306
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,480
asian

1307
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,640
thank you

1308
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,599
well you're presenting for me

1309
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,839
go ahead

1310
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,640
yeah no problem

1311
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,440
hi my name is gian mishra and i'll be

1312
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,079
presenting on behalf of co-authors

1313
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,000
updates to vpn prefix orf solution

1314
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
next slide

1315
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,319
so the motivation of this presentation

1316
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,960
is to uh summarize uh updates uh we've

1317
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,640
had a lot of feedback from the work

1318
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,920
group and we believe we've resolved all

1319
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,760
all the issues that have come up

1320
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,160
over the previous adoption calls as well

1321
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,359
as feedback um over the uh it seems like

1322
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,920
a last year or so

1323
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,359
so here we're going to describe just all

1324
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,599
the updates so the first one is we uh

1325
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,760
the permit all mechanism

1326
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,440
is defined as a set of

1327
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,720
a set sequence to the all fs and then

1328
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,440
set rd to zero

1329
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,599
trigger the vpn prefix or f mechanism

1330
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,319
has been clarified operational process

1331
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,359
of the vpn or f or receiver has been

1332
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,920
updated to now use a three tuple so

1333
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,440
previously it was

1334
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,880
just an rd

1335
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,040
and we did have a lot of feedback from

1336
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,280
the work group related to using rd for

1337
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,079
filtering and issues so that has changed

1338
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,880
to now being a three tuple rd source pe

1339
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,880
and rt of the vpn route and it's

1340
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,760
extracted from the bgp update uh source

1341
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,920
petl to define the identity of the

1342
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,480
source of the vpn routes we're set to a

1343
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,720
next top community for option c for

1344
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,839
enter domain scenario and then set to

1345
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,480
source p extended community for option b

1346
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,079
where the next stop is change to

1347
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,040
preserve the next hop at the inter enter

1348
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,559
a s boundary

1349
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,640
and then lastly route target tlv is

1350
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,799
defined to identify the rt of the

1351
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,520
offending vpn route so that the rt and

1352
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,079
rd can be used together to filter vpn

1353
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,839
routes where the source vrf contains

1354
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,880
multiple rts assigned to different vrfs

1355
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,319
on the receiver

1356
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,799
next slide

1357
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,880
just a quick on the quick one on the

1358
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,200
permit all mechanism a vpn prefix

1359
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,520
so due to the default behavior of orf

1360
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,079
mechanism being a deny

1361
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,319
this was something i believe one of the

1362
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,000
that i believe jeffrey haas had brought

1363
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,240
up and uh we've incorporated into the

1364
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,599
draft so it's a the deny

1365
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,280
which supports the vpn prefix oracle

1366
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,240
mechanism needs to send and permit all

1367
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,400
entry to its peers to ensure it can

1368
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,200
receive the non-offending vpn routes

1369
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,280
so that that addition has been added to

1370
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,520
the draft and

1371
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,359
we believe all issues that that have

1372
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,119
come up on the work group as well as

1373
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,520
from the last adoption call have been

1374
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,640
resolved

1375
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,200
next slide

1376
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,839
i've gone to the next slide after that

1377
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,240
so now we're at the point just comments

1378
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,640
and feedback from the work group

1379
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,559
of any other questions or outstanding

1380
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,480
anything outstanding uh we would like

1381
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,799
the work group to uh provide us any

1382
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,880
anything outstanding feedback and then

1383
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,559
we would like to uh

1384
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,440
prepare uh to proceed to a to another uh

1385
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,880
adoption call thank you

1386
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,160
thank you guys any questions

1387
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,480
okay this will come back as part of the

1388
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,319
adoption list

1389
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,319
you can find the order of adoption on

1390
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,000
the wiki

1391
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,760
okay we're going to go on to our next

1392
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,079
person

1393
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,240
john

1394
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,118
you have your uh

1395
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,359
hello everybody it's nice to be on this

1396
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,200
side of the mic as an individual

1397
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,880
contributor

1398
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,000
um

1399
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,839
so

1400
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,440
this is work that's been discussed in

1401
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,720
the list a while

1402
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,680
uh

1403
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,640
and

1404
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,599
but we went through a quick uh name

1405
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,400
change and added a number of authors

1406
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,040
uh who provided some very useful

1407
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,480
feedback about

1408
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,280
how this thing is going to be deployed

1409
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,400
in a multi-vendor way in

1410
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,240
people's networks next slide please

1411
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,000
so

1412
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,440
just quick background

1413
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,839
in the beginning was our well actually

1414
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,280
in the beginning we didn't have a good

1415
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,480
way of

1416
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,559
signaling entropy and networks

1417
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,760
and that wasn't good

1418
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,720
for

1419
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,799
reasons having to do with

1420
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,559
it's important to be able to make use of

1421
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,839
all the links in your networks

1422
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,359
and um

1423
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,359
it's become increasingly important to be

1424
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,960
able to make use of all those parallel

1425
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,559
links we have rfc 6790 that tells us how

1426
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,640
to do it it's very nice

1427
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,680
um it specifies in order to do this

1428
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,799
properly we need to be able to signal

1429
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,200
from you know egress to an ingress and

1430
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,240
say hello i can actually

1431
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,640
parse and use your entropy labels

1432
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,640
um

1433
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,359
now 6790 told us how to signal that in a

1434
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,040
bunch of different protocols

1435
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,040
one of them was bgp

1436
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,160
um

1437
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,920
had a very picked a very simple solution

1438
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,799
which is just here i've got a um

1439
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,480
an attribute it's called entropy label

1440
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,200
capability but it's not a bgp capability

1441
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,119
um it's an attribute

1442
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,640
and it's just this little dataless

1443
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,880
attribute the type code is all all

1444
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,119
that's there really it tells you

1445
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,880
hey i know how to

1446
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,359
do entropy labels that was great um

1447
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,880
there was only one little problem with

1448
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,520
it the rfc tells us

1449
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,960
for heaven's sakes don't leak this thing

1450
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,480
outside of your domain by the way it's

1451
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,359
optional transitive

1452
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,960
next slide please

1453
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
um

1454
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,119
so

1455
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,079
yeah we

1456
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,359
actually uh

1457
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,319
did we

1458
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,280
no never mind um

1459
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,760
so

1460
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,119
we uh

1461
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,760
developed a

1462
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,119
sorry

1463
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,720
somehow i've rearranged my slides um

1464
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,640
yeah anyhow

1465
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,839
the uh the

1466
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,160
leaking the attribute thing um was

1467
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,400
something we needed a solution to

1468
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,799
uh we developed a solution to this thing

1469
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,000
and

1470
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,559
kind of forgot to s

1471
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,680
tell the world about it and

1472
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,319
kind of reused attribute 28 and we feel

1473
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,240
very bad about this it wasn't on purpose

1474
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,880
we're sorry um

1475
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,480
so the

1476
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,119
current draft

1477
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,520
is basically the same thing that's

1478
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,960
already deployed on in junos

1479
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,240
but um

1480
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,040
we

1481
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,920
have sort of been

1482
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,520
beaten into

1483
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,880
admitting that yes we really should

1484
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,720
request a fresh code point for this the

1485
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,319
the beatings were not very difficult i

1486
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,839
mean it was pretty obviously the right

1487
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,119
thing so

1488
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,359
um

1489
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,680
and you know obviously that addresses

1490
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,359
then concerns about sharing the code

1491
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,160
point

1492
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,280
um

1493
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,839
next slide please

1494
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,119
no not that one

1495
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,799
but if you haven't signed in scan that

1496
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,440
qr code

1497
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,799
um

1498
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,640
i'll just uh tell a few jokes while the

1499
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,000
the uh okay here we go

1500
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,280
um

1501
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,599
[Music]

1502
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,160
yeah so

1503
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,280
no the this slide is fine

1504
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,280
i i had a funny little build but you can

1505
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,520
just go ahead and go to the last one

1506
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,359
um so

1507
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,599
right just to to you know give a quick

1508
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,960
outline of of the solution um as you

1509
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,920
recall

1510
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,079
i said the previous version was a

1511
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,760
dataless

1512
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,839
attribute

1513
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,599
um and we you know talked amongst

1514
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,119
ourselves about well what are the

1515
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,520
constraints we need to fulfill here

1516
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,119
one of them is

1517
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,280
the thing shouldn't leak and the other

1518
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,480
is

1519
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,359
that

1520
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,240
it

1521
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,640
shouldn't require a

1522
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,640
um forklift of your route reflector

1523
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,280
infrastructure in order to deploy it

1524
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,400
um

1525
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,640
and that

1526
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,480
you know the the the bottom one comes

1527
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,880
from the laws of physics and the top one

1528
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,960
or sort of and the top one comes from

1529
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,000
strong

1530
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,480
input from network operators that have

1531
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,640
constraints in how they deploy code in

1532
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,200
their networks

1533
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,920
so

1534
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,520
being able to

1535
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,079
deploy across

1536
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,079
older route reflector installations

1537
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,400
implies you need optional transitive not

1538
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,799
leaking implies not having optional

1539
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:01,920
transitive

1540
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,680
oh my goodness what shall we do next

1541
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,400
please

1542
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,559
so next please

1543
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,119
let's try again instead of not leaking

1544
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,680
next please

1545
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,400
we said well what if instead of that we

1546
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,559
do no harm if it does leak next place

1547
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,799
so

1548
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,160
doing no harm

1549
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,400
ended up looking like

1550
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,079
well what if we

1551
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,359
take the uh

1552
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,640
the next hop and just copy it into data

1553
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,440
that is in this attribute

1554
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,599
and then say right if i'm a receiver and

1555
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,880
i get this thing i take a look at the

1556
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,559
next hop i take a look at the data in

1557
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,559
the attribute are they the same okay

1558
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,400
that means that nobody has molested this

1559
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,960
thing as it comes towards me i can be

1560
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,920
fairly sure that the um

1561
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,039
the the

1562
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,559
router that sent me this attribute

1563
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,280
really can

1564
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,880
handle after um

1565
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,960
handle entropy labels as

1566
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,000
as it

1567
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,480
promises to uh if they don't match you

1568
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,400
take the thing you throw it out

1569
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,960
next please

1570
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,119
um it's probably faster to read the

1571
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,559
draft than to listen to me talking about

1572
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,400
it's a very short draft

1573
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,760
um

1574
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,400
[Music]

1575
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
so we had some good discussion about

1576
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,799
this on the list um as i said we you

1577
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,440
know in part were jawboned into moving

1578
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,880
to a

1579
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,960
new code point um

1580
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,480
uh bruno suggested allowing uh

1581
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,240
trailing data just in case we want to do

1582
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,760
something else with this in the future

1583
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,599
seems reasonable

1584
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,359
um and

1585
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,359
we've also been asked you know oh you

1586
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,119
really should put in some considerations

1587
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,000
for

1588
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,400
how this thing interoperates with the

1589
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,880
thing that you already have in the field

1590
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,720
and i think it makes sense to put in a

1591
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,480
section about that too

1592
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,720
so very soon we'll publish a version of

1593
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,559
one that that has at least those two

1594
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,559
things and you know if anybody is

1595
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,839
looking for something else you know

1596
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,359
please speak up either at the mic or on

1597
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,160
the list next place

1598
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,559
right so what's next um

1599
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,760
in no particular order we will publish a

1600
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,240
version one we'd also like to

1601
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,559
have this adopted by the working group

1602
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,799
uh there's you know a fairly obvious

1603
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,400
need to have a standardized solution

1604
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,280
here um and we've got some deployment

1605
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,960
experience that says this thing works in

1606
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,559
the field

1607
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,599
and we'd like to you know come clean get

1608
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,799
it standardized get um

1609
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,880
get it out there and get it done so my

1610
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,720
hope would be uh

1611
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,039
to adopt it and then fairly quickly move

1612
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,799
to working group last call and looks

1613
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,400
like we have 38 seconds for questions

1614
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,559
any questions

1615
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,038
swedish have the mic

1616
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,640
swadesh are you muted

1617
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,559
oh no your your mic isn't even turned on

1618
01:04:58,559 --> 01:04:59,920
yet

1619
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,520
you hear me now

1620
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,559
yes

1621
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,280
yeah hi john so i have a question so now

1622
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,960
since you are adding a little

1623
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,799
information which is originated in this

1624
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,359
attribute as what you just mentioned

1625
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,599
won't it be a security concern that you

1626
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:14,880
are taking a

1627
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,559
transport information which may get

1628
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,920
leaked outside because this change

1629
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,599
so that is a very interesting point and

1630
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,359
we'll put that in the security

1631
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,280
considerations in the next version and

1632
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,520
also give it a bit of a think

1633
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,400
uh to see if we can do any better but it

1634
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,599
at least belongs in the security

1635
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,119
considerations thank you for pointing it

1636
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,720
out

1637
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,720
greedy

1638
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,559
i want to apologize profusely for

1639
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,319
starting this whole thing

1640
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,720
and thank you to john and others for

1641
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,839
fixing up my

1642
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:54,558
mess oh it was rms but anyway thanks

1643
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,240
okay thanks john uh next presentation is

1644
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,880
bgbsr policy extensions actually sorry

1645
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,640
that one's g that one's uh deferred to

1646
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,160
land

1647
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,400
the next one is beach bls extensions for

1648
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,319
sr network resource ran chen

1649
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,319
transports

1650
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,720
this is the correct slide deck

1651
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,000
today i'd like to do the priorities

1652
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,839
about bgpr

1653
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,119
a business foreign network resource

1654
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,760
partition states on behalf of all

1655
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,880
authors

1656
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,599
next please

1657
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,280
yes this page is the introductions of

1658
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,480
framework and definitions of ietf

1659
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,440
network slice is provided in draft

1660

1667
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,240
the solutions to realize a network

1668

1670
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,839
and icip appears

1671
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,440
and the idp extensions for sr networks

1672
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,720

1673
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,720

bcplis defines the link with an oi that

1676
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,839
can be a node mri a link right or

1677
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:12,400
prefix the link status information is

1678
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,799
mapped to pdp state and roi within the

1679

1686
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,679
um

1687
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:45,600
this is the summary summary activities

1688
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,040
for srps

1689
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,600
we defined we define an api dtr way to

1690
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,799
indicate the list of rp's that a node

1691
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,080
belongs to

1692
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,960
and an api id list is up to our way to

1693
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,679
indicate the list of rpgs that a link

1694
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,759
belongs to

1695
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,040
an rpid for our two functions

1696
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,920
to

1697
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,960
otherwise advertise the rpid file to

1698
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,560
conduct number associated with a pirate

1699
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,359
house three at this thing

1700
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,479
and also they found an appearance they

1701
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,640
said blood

1702
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,198
an rp language

1703
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,439
at the nrp prefix state

1704
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,678
for srv6

1705
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,040
locators and srv6

1706
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,399
that are associated with rpid

1707
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,040
and the difference in rpsrv6 and xt

1708
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,760
and ar psrv6

1709
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,360
in the exit state next place

1710
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,440
next piece is the the details for the

1711
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,840
experiences of rpid

1712
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,760
the rpta is used in order to advertise

1713
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,280
with network

1714
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,930
resource

1715
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,140
[Music]

1716
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,280
network

1717
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,239
resource that node belongs to

1718
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,120
and

1719
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,880
this is the format of the api dtm it

1720
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,040
mainly contains rpid

1721
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,719
which is used to indicate the results of

1722
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,600
specific nodes that will be

1723
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
checked washed by also authorized

1724
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,360
aggregate next please

1725
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,600
and this is for an api id list software

1726
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,640
uh the rp

1727
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,480
ids the tr way is associated with the

1728
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,320
link on our i and this is the format of

1729
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,960
the rpid list

1730
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,560
it mainly contains an rpid

1731
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,719
which is used to in the cases the

1732
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,440
results are specifically

1733
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,000
that will be used for worse less less

1734
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,440
i'll regret

1735
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,080
next please

1736
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,280
next is

1737
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,000
is for rpid for

1738
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,040
our two products members

1739
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,840
this year ultimate system is used to

1740
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,040
advertise not pid for automobile bundles

1741
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,120
member associated with

1742
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,120
apparently agency which is point to

1743
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,320
point

1744
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,920
and it

1745
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,800
in this subtle way it mainly contains

1746
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,480
out to bundles member in rpid

1747
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,760
there must be one rpid for use of the lg

1748
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,040
bundles mapper advertised under the

1749
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,239
auto bundles member to build this raptor

1750
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,559
next place

1751
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,880
and this is the nrpcs

1752
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,000
lrp prefix state tlk should only be

1753
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,760
edited added to the pdpis tribute

1754
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,280
associated with the prefix

1755
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,080
this field is used to advertising the

1756
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,960
multiple nip prefix things

1757
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,960
under the lrp prefix synthetic

1758
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,320
this is the format of the prefix thing

1759
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,840
software

1760
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,719
and it contains the rpid which is

1761
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:43,280
identifies therapy information called

1762
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,159
responding to the prefix state

1763
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:50,559
and the next is an appeal of this

1764
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,880
this this certainty safety always used

1765
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,560
to advertise multiple nrp uh

1766
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,000
to the controller uh as this is it needs

1767
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,239
to be allocated for an rp id and it does

1768
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,199
use this

1769
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,719
it also contains

1770
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,920
an rpid which is identifies the rpid

1771
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,120
information corresponding to the

1772
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,840
additional

1773
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,560
next please

1774
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,880
uh this is the happy lions acid uh

1775
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,719
inline a stab network obviously 8667

1776
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,960
defines the language you see

1777
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,000
some qre for water to advertise the

1778
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,040
agency state of each of its neighbors

1779
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,840
another large associated

1780
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,640
advertisement

1781
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,760
allocated for an api id

1782
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,520
and in this

1783
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,880
tr way it contains an rpid which is

1784
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,040
enterprise therapy information

1785
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,519
corresponding to the largest next place

1786
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,199
um

1787
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:21,440
this is rpc for srv6 as i always see

1788
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,880
contributes with ipv6 prefix

1789
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
uh the world test using the new pdpr i

1790
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,040
thought we built tlw and associated with

1791
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,080
pdpr is prefix now

1792
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,400
i saw physics located here it was

1793
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,760
introduced

1794
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,040
the uh draft idr gpis as research

1795
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,440
to advertise as a reasoning

1796
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,840
location and additional attributes for

1797
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,840
the given srv6

1798
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,760
uh locator a new snl e6000k

1799
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,040
that is associated with a specific rpid

1800
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,080
other

1801
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,040
this

1802
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,840
this

1803
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,440
subject is obviously optional

1804
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,520
way of srv6 and access to our underlying

1805
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,760
access to our way

1806
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
next please

1807
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,960
comment

1808
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,280
next is the last page

1809
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,480
welcome comments and welcome to fulfill

1810
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,840
this work together thank you

1811
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,800
k-10 you can have a very short response

1812
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,480
yeah a quick comment

1813
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,400
all of this information is derived from

1814
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,280
an underlying lsr working group draft

1815
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,199
which is an individual draft

1816
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,719
the question is why do we need a

1817
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,280
separate bgpls draft and why all of this

1818
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,600
can't be put in the lsr draft and

1819
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,199
handled in the lsr working group

1820
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,880
um

1821
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,000
so

1822
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,719
uh we had this this car said

1823
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,040
but i think

1824
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,679
it is better to separate

1825
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,520
it it is better to have separate

1826
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,800
distract to this

1827
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,640
off a lot

1828
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,239
okay

1829
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:26,080
i'll i'll leave it to the chairs

1830
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,280
okay i'm sorry we're gonna have to cut

1831
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,640
the bike queue due to other time

1832
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,159
i'm having difficulty looking for the

1833
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,040
presentation for redundancy policy so

1834
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
we're going to be moving into the

1835
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,520
igp.net extensions and look for their

1836
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,159
presentation

1837
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,959
okay thank

1838
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,760
hi

1839
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,000

ah thank you

1841
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,000
hi this is shusung and i will introduce

1842
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,120
our work

1843
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,840
about bgpls advertisement for

1844
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,360
enhancer.net

1845
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,000
next slide

1846
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,320
please this page just shows a very brief

1847
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,000
introduction to uh the work in that net

1848
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,400
uh the most important features

1849
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,880
introduced by the net cues is

1850
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,760
uh

1851
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,640
boundary latency and the bonding cheater

1852
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,520
also zero packet loss and upper bound on

1853
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,920
out of order packet delivery

1854
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,560
to achieve these standard qs features

1855
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,640
there are

1856
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,520
three key technologies to to implement

1857
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,800
than that

1858
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,199
including resource allocation service

1859
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,000
protection and explicit routines

1860
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,080
uh this document uh is try to

1861
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,199
give some

1862
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,400
the introduction to our work

1863
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,159
about how to extend bgprs to support

1864
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,600
that net resource allocation and

1865
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,640
set up explicit routines that can

1866
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,280
satisfy the requirement of the net

1867
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,480
uh next slide please

1868
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,239
uh basically we introduce new link

1869
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,280
attribute and the node attribute tlvs

1870
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,320
for then bonding latency

1871
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,960
including maximum dead net reserve

1872
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,679
reservable bandwidth sub tlv than an

1873
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,920
available bandwidth subtree and then

1874
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,000
time resources of tlv

1875
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,120
for node

1876
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,040
attribute tlvs

1877
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,440
we introduce the net processing delay

1878
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,440
subtle next slide please

1879
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,239
actually this is very similar to the

1880
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,360
bgpls extension for igp

1881
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,400
traffic engineering

1882
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,760
because that net bandwidth allocated in

1883
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,080
each link could be different from

1884
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,040
non-data flows so we defined

1885
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,000
two

1886
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,280
separated

1887
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,560
attribute in for that net one is a

1888
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,640
maximum then and reservable bandwidth

1889
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,920
subtle we

1890
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,480
which specify the maximum amount of

1891
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,040
bandwidth that could be reserved for

1892
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,880
that net on this link

1893
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,760
and this value should be smaller than

1894
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,080
the value of maximum reservable link

1895
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,400
bandwidth defined erc of 5305

1896
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,679
and also there

1897
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:48,719
another

1898
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,480
attribute is then that

1899
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,120
available bandwidth subtle which defines

1900
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,120
the available bandwidth that

1901
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,000
can be reserved for the net flow on this

1902
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,480
thing for now which is the value of

1903
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,760
manners the

1904
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,239
uh the the net bandwidth that have

1905
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,639
already been allocated for the existing

1906
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,239
tenant streams

1907
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,040
next slide please

1908
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,360
uh this time this slide shows the the

1909
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,400
link attribute tlvs we try to introduce

1910
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,840
for enhanced

1911
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,600
uh that net

1912
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,480
the the key point here is that for that

1913
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,840
now flows the the bandwidth is not

1914
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,520
enough for

1915
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,320
the

1916
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,760
the resource information because

1917
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,800
then that requests the boundary latency

1918
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,760
so we introduced a new attribute called

1919
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,480
time resource subtle

1920
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
when the underlying technology is a

1921
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,120
logical cue based scheduling mechanism

1922
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,840
it represents a qid

1923
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,760
uh and there are different technologies

1924
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,080
for implementing logical cues for

1925
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,880
example uh the existing queues

1926
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,159
mechanisms or flexi or other

1927
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,560
implementation

1928
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,960
and when the underlying technology is

1929
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,800
time scheduling based mechanisms it can

1930
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,440
represent a time slot that could be

1931
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,120
allocated for

1932
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,760
dyna flows in each link

1933
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,159
for example there are some mechanisms

1934
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,120
that

1935
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,239
have been

1936
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:25,199
discussed in the networking group

1937
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:28,560
they introduced the cyclic qe mechanisms

1938
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,800
which could be considered as a

1939
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,639
special form of the time scheduling

1940
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,639
whose time slot is

1941
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,639
with equal length

1942
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,320
because there are two types of

1943
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,760
underlying techniques so we we also

1944
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,159
introduced two type of time results

1945
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:49,040
subtly one is time resource for logical

1946
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,840
q subtle v and another is time resource

1947
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,159
for time scheduling subtle

1948
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,480
in the time resource for logical queue

1949
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,199
subtle v the basic idea here is that we

1950
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,480
have uh

1951
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,600
a set of queues and each queue has um

1952
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,679
a buffer size and a

1953
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,800
abandoned volume and these uh two

1954
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,080
features is to guarantee the the packet

1955
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,960
going through the queue with

1956
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,159
max

1957
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,400
expected maximum carrying delay and

1958
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,080
minimum queuing delay

1959
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,960
and also the expected uh delay variation

1960
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,639
so that is different from the

1961
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,440
traditional bandwidth allocation

1962
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,880
mechanisms and another

1963
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,639
another

1964
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,800
attribute is time results for time

1965
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,560
scheduling subtle

1966
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,800
and the the

1967
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
the attributes we introduced include

1968
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,199
time slot lens temp slot start time and

1969
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,960
time slot and time

1970
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,800
which means that we can

1971
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,120
allocate a particular time slot for the

1972
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,480
link to a particular net flow

1973
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,360
next slide please

1974
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,679
and also for the node attribute tlv

1975
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,280
we also

1976
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,400
a new

1977
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,520
uh

1978
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,840
tlv called dynamite processing delay

1979
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,199
subtle

1980
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,480
in scope of done that the the delay of

1981
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
each hub is divided mainly into three

1982
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,400
parts one is link delay one is

1983
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
processing delay and the one is queuing

1984
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,960
delay considering that queuing delay

1985
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,800
could be guaranteed by some queuing

1986
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,960
mechanisms and

1987
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,840
which

1988
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,199
is described with the time resource id

1989
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,040
we have already introduced

1990
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,080
and this part will just shows that in

1991
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,440
in that net packet processing delay uh

1992
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,760
begins after the packet goes into the

1993
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,239
input port and ends up before the packet

1994
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,280
arrives the output buffer

1995
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,199
can expect it in a known range so the

1996
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,000
the

1997
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,880
value of this processing delay could be

1998
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,840
the new attribute for enhancer than that

1999
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,320
next slide please

2000
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,400
next slide please

2001
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,639
uh yeah this is uh just

2002
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,400
what the others

2003
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,199
want to be done in the next step uh we

2004
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,400
have a very similar document in uh our

2005
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,760
lsr hardworking group to describe how to

2006
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,960
um introduce these attributes also for

2007
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,400
igp

2008
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,040
so we would like to collect the comments

2009
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,320
both from idr and ios our working group

2010
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,960
and also we would like to uh

2011
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,280
seek for further cooperation with people

2012
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,080
who are interested in this work

2013
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,320
thank you

2014
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,280
we have time for a brief question if

2015
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,519
there's one

2016
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,560
fun that we found your slides

2017
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,239
thank you and this is fanyang from

2018
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,800
hawaii and on behalf of the other

2019
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,400
courses i will

2020
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,000
present this

2021
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,360
advertising the redundancy policy in bgp

2022
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,839
next please

2023
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,360
yeah here's some in background of the

2024
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,840
redundancy protection and redundancy

2025
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,960
policy

2026
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,840
i've already introduced in spring and

2027
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,120
pcep

2028
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,600
pce working group

2029
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,080
about this background but

2030
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,400
in case there are people

2031
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,120
who are not familiar with this

2032
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,719
mechanism i will

2033
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,480
repeat the

2034
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,520
the introduction here uh so redundancy

2035
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,120
uh protection is a generalized

2036
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,280
protection mechanism that used in the

2037
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,280
context of the sr

2038
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,560
um and as shown in this figure that uh

2039
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,440
it replicates the service packet at the

2040
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,880
redundancy node and transmit uh through

2041
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,800
transmit the copies of the packet

2042
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,120
through different uh multiple different

2043
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,639
destroyed paths

2044
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:17,600
and

2045
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,560
it

2046
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,280
and the merging node

2047
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,760
transmit correct the first correct and

2048
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,719
re-eliminate the redundance packet

2049
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,679
uh

2050
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,400
at this note

2051
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,639
right now we have four uh job to

2052
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,760
introduce this um mechanism the first

2053
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,920
one is the uh

2054
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,840
the first one introduced the

2055
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,639
identity seed and emerging seed uh in

2056
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,719
the date plane and the second one

2057
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,199
introduced the redundancy policy in the

2058
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:50,400
control plane so the other two

2059
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,360
actually are the pcep

2060
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,800
and bgp

2061
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,120
extensions to support the

2062
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,719
uh the redundancy policy

2063
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,520
and next please

2064
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,280
and here is the background information

2065
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,360
about the redundancy policy

2066
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,239
it is defined as a variant of sr policy

2067
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,239
with minimum changes

2068
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,239
and inherits the

2069
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,480
main structure and the most of the

2070
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,639
attributes from the s of the sr policy

2071
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,320
and

2072
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,719
next please i think

2073
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,800
we have more information here

2074
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,239
um

2075
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,960
here that down the left side um

2076
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,679
we it is the information model of the

2077
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,120
history dentist policy and in this uh in

2078
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,600
the redemptive policy we introduce a new

2079
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,199
optional uh attribute and the

2080
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:49,199
candid candidate past level and the new

2081
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,480
flag

2082
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,880
we defined a new flag named

2083
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,239
redundancy flag to indicate the type of

2084
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,639
the candidate pass for used for

2085
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,400
redundancy forwarding

2086
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,280
so um on the uh on the right side it is

2087
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,760
the btp encoding structure

2088
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,239
and we uh at the same time um

2089
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:13,280
correspondingly we introduce another uh

2090
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,280
introduce another attribute

2091
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,679
of the redundance flag

2092
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:18,560
and

2093
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,840
um

2094
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,760
and

2095
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,480
and and for the redundancy policy that

2096
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,440
if we

2097
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,400
if the if this as our policy is with the

2098
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,000
redundancy flag

2099
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,800
so all the segments uh all the sudden

2100
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,880
all the seed lists are

2101
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,199
all the sales in this candid path are

2102
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,040
used for the redundancy

2103
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,000
redundancy forwarding it means that each

2104
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,440
list will

2105
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,760
carries entire copy of the service

2106
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,040
packets

2107
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,480
so and

2108
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,480
in

2109
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,520
so in this is in this case that there is

2110
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,800
no uh weight because there's no load

2111
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,760
balancing function it means that the

2112
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,280
weight of each

2113
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,760
list is not applicable

2114
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,239
so uh on the other on the right side are

2115
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,800
on the right side so there is no weight

2116
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,320
attribute for each segment list

2117
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,960
next please

2118
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,719
so here we defined a new uh flag sub trv

2119
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,520
for this for the at the candidate past

2120
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,440
level and this new uh this new flag sub

2121
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:32,960
trv is optional trv and it um distribute

2122
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,120
the the flag of the

2123
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,960
of the candid pass

2124
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,360
currently we used eight eight bit uh to

2125
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,120
convey the flag information um but uh at

2126
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,480
this writing time that we only uh

2127
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,120
there's only one flag uh redundancy is

2128
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,840
defined

2129
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,639
and next please

2130
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,080
um

2131
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,600
as

2132
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,400
as defined or as

2133
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:09,040
described in the redundancy policy um

2134
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,760
in the draft of the dentist policy uh

2135
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,480
this relentless policy is optionally is

2136
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,880
optionally uh associated with the

2137
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,560
bounding segment

2138
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,120
and and this monthly segment this only

2139
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,639
can only be the redundancy segment and

2140
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,239
all this background information is

2141
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,480
described in the previous uh um draft

2142
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,040
describe the redundancy protection under

2143
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,600
the redundancy policy

2144
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,400
so it when the redundancy policy is

2145
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,440
associated with the uh bounding segment

2146
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,600
uh the redundancy segment

2147
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,280
and so this uh so the bounding

2148
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,560
seed or the srv6 foundation seed and the

2149
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,679
endpoint behavior of this bonding seed

2150
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,440
the information

2151
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,440
are it should be

2152
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,920
the information should be distributed at

2153
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,000
the same time

2154
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,560
next please

2155
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,639
and here is the entire

2156
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,960
particle extensions to

2157
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,280
to support the redundancy protection

2158
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,360
mechanism

2159
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,159
and next please

2160
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,320
so uh next step for this uh drafted we

2161
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,159
would like to have more discussion on

2162
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,199
the mailing list and uh

2163
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:30,320
for the basic that we need to uh to keep

2164
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,120
aligned with the progress in spring

2165
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:36,719
the progress of the redundancy policy

2166
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,360
and thank you for the for listening and

2167
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,280
we would like to have

2168
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,520
more com to hear

2169
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,520
comments and testers thank you

2170
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,040
any

2171
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,800
questions okay thank you fun

2172
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,560
hello everyone

2173
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,400
we can hear you

2174
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,280
uh this is sony from huawei we did a

2175
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,480
pgpsr policy

2176
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,679
attention for enhancer that night next

2177
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,080
slide please

2178
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,000
segment routine is described in draft

2179
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,760
itf's ring

2180
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,159
segment routine policy this structure

2181
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:35,679
defines that

2182
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,120
as a policy is a set of conducted paths

2183
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,000
which consists of one or more segmented

2184
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,960
list

2185
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,000
the price of my certain folder had

2186
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,560
in the node to instruct the source

2187
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,000
routine

2188
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
rfc8655

2189
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,400
the overall

2190
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,760
architecture for datum

2191
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,560
deterministic

2192
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,280
uh

2193
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,480

01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,280
by introducing bounded language

2202
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,880
information which is the that's not a

2213
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,520
this doctor this documentary defines the

2214
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,719
sr policy intentions to carry the bonded

2215
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:01,920

2216
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,360
conflicted parts of assa policy

2217
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,679
so that

2218
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,360
black behavior can be enabled

2219
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,120
automatically when as our policy is

2220
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,960
applied

2221
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,679
that says please

2222
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,480
these are the the this other oval of the

2223
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,360
related drafts we have to enhance the

2224
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,920
detonator draft folder date plan and the

2225
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,280
four drafts for the king chopra

2226
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,480
next slide please

2227
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,040
bonding intensity information is used to

2228
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,600
indicate the requirement and resource

2229
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,239
allocation for each

2230
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,800
of the nodes in the past to guarantee

2231
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,600
the bonding latency transmission

2232
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,320
when using as our policy to deliver the

2233
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,600
candidate

2234
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,679
that net pass the bi needed to be

2235
01:34:56,679 --> 01:34:58,239
absolutely

2236
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,360
in the sr policy and then the hydro node

2237
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:05,600
of pulsator and writes it into a package

2238
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,800
the format of vr is as the finger

2239
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,040
material below

2240
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,199
there is a proposed interactive vcc.net

2241
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:18,159
enhancer data plan

2242
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:21,440
let's assess please

2243
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,239
we need different kinds of bi to

2244
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,480
guarantee the bonding intensive

2245
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,440
transmission the our officer knows our

2246
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,840
addresses in the

2247
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,600
explicit path indicated by the segment

2248
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,760
is a request a different vr media

2249
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,480
in our at least the sub carry to provide

2250
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:47,360
the bonded latest information for each

2251
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,440
node or addresses in their path

2252
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,480
while the author knows all adjusters in

2253
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,440
the inspire

2254
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,480
indicated by the segment list requests

2255
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,760
the same price with the funds or shared

2256
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,360
brs some pra to provide a drop bond

2257
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,480
digital entity for all journals

2258
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,920
because each segment list represents a

2259
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,199
path another bonded length is also

2260
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,679
assorated with a puzzle so the bonded

2261
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,800
lantern information needs to be

2262
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,960
encapsulated in the segment list

2263
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,680

the to the sr policy

2286
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,360
let's just ask please

2287
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,520
well the next step survey i welcome any

2288
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,159
discussion on the main list another

2289
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,719
content of this structure also needed to

2290
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,800
keep on register progress in that net

2291
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,040
thank you

2292
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,760
any questions

2293
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,920
thank you for your presentation next one

2294
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,400
will be soon one

2295
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,560
hello

2296
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,639
we can hear you

2297
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,920
okay

2298
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,320
hi everyone and so one from huawei

2299
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,560
the topic i am presenting is how to use

2300
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,080
a new ptp external attendee community to

2301
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,679
identify the target node

2302
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,679
yes

2303
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,880
this work has been presentated at iatf

2304
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,440
101 109 meeting until we get on a feel

2305
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,320
good feedback along the ietf community

2306
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,800
uh thank thanks to everyone for their

2307
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,440
use for the comments and the suggestions

2308
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,119
at this point

2309
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,119
all that commons

2310
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,040
has have been

2311
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,600
adjusted

2312
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,800
here is

2313
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,960
update since the last presentation

2314
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:11,040
we added some text to enable ah to

2315
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,080
configure local policy to reflect

2316
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,679
updates to

2317
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,880
to match the pgps

2318
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,679
and

2319
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,239
we add a test test

2320
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:26,320
on security consideration

2321
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:31,440
next please

2322
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,360
here we give a detailed example to

2323
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:43,199
describe a white node use rt to identify

2324
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,280
the target node

2325
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,040
rt is designed to control export and

2326
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,760
import of the vpn looks

2327
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,960
an arty can be shared by multi

2328
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,719
multiple nodes

2329
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,159
in our example node a otherwise the vpn

2330
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:03,440
follows back the load with two artists

2331
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,159
rt mode b and rd ladder

2332
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,960
the node b rt is used to identify the

2333
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,199
node b and the red rt is used to export

2334
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:16,880
a loader tool we have red

2335
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,360
r left left lens

2336
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,920
level level reflector such loose to the

2337
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,960
node b

2338
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,520
the node d receives such a node such

2339
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,400
loose

2340
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,000
then export e

2341
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,400
into where i have leader

2342
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,760
in this case

2343
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,920
use r using rt

2344
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,960
cannot prevent the notative long

2345
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,159
important routes that do not belongs to

2346
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,000
e

2347
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,719
therefore we need another target

2348
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:47,280
community leader is different from the

2349
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,520
rt

2350
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,840
next

2351
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,280
this child introduced a new bdp external

2352
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,360
community

2353
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,239
is

2354
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:03,520
used to

2355
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,440
carry the target node information

2356
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,239
the subtype value for the extended

2357
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:11,920
community has

2358
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,199
been assigned and this future has been

2359
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:19,679
included in our product load mapper

2360
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,560
next please

2361
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,480
all the call all unknown comments has

2362
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,040
been have been addressed

2363
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,320
now uh

2364
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,880
we will request the wg adopter list list

2365
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,400
worker

2366
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,280
and any more question or comments are

2367
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,960
where canada

2368
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,480
let's all thank you

2369
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,960
do we have any questions

2370
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,040
it appears not thank you for your

2371
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,679
presentation

2372
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:05,239
okay thank you

2373
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,639
there it is

2374
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,840
gee if you're speaking we cannot

2375
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,400
currently hear you

2376
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,800
okay she's still not hurting me

2377
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,880
we can now hear you

2378
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,280
ready

2379
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:37,400
okay so now it's put

2380
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,639
it's good

2381
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,400
okay

2382
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,239
uh thanks uh for arranging this uh uh

2383
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,880
topics uh

2384
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:53,800
but i can now see the slides now

2385
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,960
are you sharing the slice or it's only

2386
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,480
me can i see it

2387
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,920
it is only you we're sharing the slide

2388
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,639
okay maybe i can you can pull up your

2389
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,239
local copy of the slides i will just

2390
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:18,560
talk you through the slide number

2391
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,760
okay

2392
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,080
you know i can see it so i can see the

2393
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,520
background page right there displaying

2394
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,840
slightly

2395
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,600
okay

2396
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,480
so

2397
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,320
for the background we know the segment

2398
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,280
add policy it defines a set of candidate

2399
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,760
parts and each of each consisting of one

2400
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,159
or more segment list and associated

2401
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,400
information and it can be used to steer

2402
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,719
the packet to the answer policy and

2403
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,639
augment the packet header with a segment

2404
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,320
list

2405
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,560
for the nano slicing that concept and

2406
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,119
energy resource partition was defined as

2407
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,280
a collection of the network resources

2408
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,600
allocated in the android network

2409
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,400
and certain ietf network slide services

2410
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,199
can be mapped to the nrp to obtain the

2411
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,638
required service performance

2412
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,119
for a network which consists of multiple

2413
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:08,560
nrps

2414
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,639
asset policy may be associated with a

2415
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,400
particular nrp

2416
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,880
and this association between data policy

2417
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,600
and nlp needs to be specified

2418
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,920
so that package steered to the entire

2419
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,800
policy can be augmented with both the

2420
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,560
segment list and the nrp identifier

2421
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,560
this document defines the extensions to

2422
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,520
be to bgp as a policy so that we can

2423
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,840
indicate the nrp which the asset policy

2424
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,639
is associated with

2425
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:40,440
okay next page please

2426
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:55,440
it's a bit slow

2427
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,400
we are on slide three

2428
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:03,119
okay i'm here opening it on my side

2429
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,400
i still cannot see it

2430
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,199
um

2431
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,560
that's okay

2432
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,560
so light is labeled so far

2433
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:26,239
okay for that extensions uh we define a

2434
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,800
new subtitle we call the energy subtley

2435
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,000
and the

2436
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,320
easily tunnel caps attribute it can be

2437
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,800
carried in this big handling attribute

2438
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,920
when the tunnel type is data policy

2439
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,960
and this

2440
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,199
format is showing this figure and we

2441
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,960
have the flex field

2442
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,480
none of the flash is defined as for now

2443
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,880
and the result field is also reserved

2444
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,239
for future use

2445
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:53,360
and the four octet nrp id which is to

2446
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,639
identify the domain specific uh

2447
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,320
significant identifier of the nrp

2448
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,679
value zero and the

2449
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,880
f5 are reserved

2450
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,400
okay next page please

2451
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,080
run slide four

2452
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,440
okay so here is the updated gps policy

2453
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:24,159
encoding we can see here we add the nrp

2454
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:26,960
tle as a

2455
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,000
attribute of the candidate path

2456
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,239
so that it is uh

2457
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,760
shown in this

2458
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,320
encoding structure

2459
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,159
we think that is uh

2460
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,280
so that we can identify the an rpid

2461
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,159
associated with a specific as our policy

2462
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,800
candidate pass with this mechanism

2463
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,360
okay next page

2464
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,000
slide five

2465
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,360
okay so for the procedures uh basically

2466
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,679
the original originating node of the

2467
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:03,199
data policy

2468
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:07,040
should include this nrp sub tlc in the

2469
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,440
bjp tunneling caps attribute of the sub

2470
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,360
policy to specify the associated energy

2471
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,600
and the setting of other fields are not

2472
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:16,960
changed

2473
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,199
so when and as a policy ingress node

2474
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,840
receives this as a policy can it kind of

2475
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,719
pass

2476
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,080
which is uh both acceptable and usable

2477
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,520
it should in cash encapsulate an rpid

2478
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,440
into the header of the package which are

2479
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,679
steered to the asset policy

2480
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:36,639
here we add two reference to the

2481
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,199
drafts which define the encapsulation of

2482
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:40,800
the rpe

2483
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,800
id in the

2484
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,480
both in ipv6 data plane and the isr

2485
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,360
amperes digitally

2486
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,480
okay

2487
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,360
next page please

2488
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,840
slide

2489
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,400
six uh here we are some operational

2490
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,679
considerations uh

2491
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,199
although we think this proposed

2492
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:10,960
mechanism allows to uh i then uh

2493
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,040
associated the

2494
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,199
different kennedy path in one as a

2495
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:18,639
policy with different nrps but in normal

2496
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,119
scenarios it is considered that

2497
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,280
association between the assad policy and

2498
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,360
nrp is consistent

2499
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,480
so now

2500
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,280
we

2501
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,239
think in normal case all the candidate

2502
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,159
passes of the same as our policy should

2503
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:36,000
be associated with the same nrp

2504
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,560
okay next page

2505
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,080
slide seven

2506
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,800
so for the next steps uh i think this

2507
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,400
mechanism is straightforward and the

2508
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,800
document is short i would like to

2509
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,400
suggest people to

2510
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,840
give it a read and send comments and

2511
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:58,480
feedbacks to us out to list

2512
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,560
and we would also think

2513
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,560
this draft is has been

2514
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,239
stable so maybe we consider double group

2515
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:08,239
adoption

2516
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,119
okay thank

2517
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,199
okay we have time for questions are

2518
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:20,598
there any questions

2519
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,679
we have no questions thank you thank you

2520
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,800
so this comes to the end of the

2521
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,800
materials for idr

2522
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,159
we see there's some interesting and

2523
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,920
energetic discussion happening in the

2524
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,960
chat

2525
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,480
feel free to take any of that to the

2526
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,119
mailing list

2527
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,400
aside from that

2528
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,239
this ends idr for iatf 114 we will see

2529
01:50:56,239 --> 01:51:00,440
you in london thank you

2530
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
okay
