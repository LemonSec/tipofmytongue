1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,360
so I make that 10 o'clock by my laptop

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,639
but uh I don't know how accurate my ntp

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,000
sources so uh hello everybody let's

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
let's start the meeting

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,660
um a few people can dribble in at the

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,420
back it's absolutely fine so this is

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,699
reliable and available Wireless raw this

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,680
is not the wrestling organization this

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,720
is actually an ietf working group so if

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,980
you're in the wrong meeting now's your

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,779
chance to leave and take your plastic

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,219
chairs with you

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,079
sorry budget

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,719
um so Eve unfortunately wanted to be

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,760
here in person but can't make it uh so

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,260
she's dialed in remotely so you just

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,640
have me in the room but I think that

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
should be a pretty good combination for

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,520
for both of us

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,920
so uh first off this is an ITF working

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,480
group meeting therefore covered by the

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
note well I'm hoping by Wednesday you

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,739
will have at least come across a note

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:53,940
well before

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,360
uh I am not a lawyer but as I am led to

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,699
believe by people who are basically this

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,440
means anything you contribute at the

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
microphone or in the chat or submit to

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
the mailing list is covered by you are

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
releasing that IPR if you have any

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,500
concerns over this please consult the

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,260
references in the note well please uh

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,659
look at it as a serious document and try

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,759
and avoid making any mistakes if you are

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
unsure don't say anything read the note

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
well and then say something

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,320
um this is freely available in various

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,320
places in the uh ITF so I suggest you go

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,420
back and look at it if you haven't read

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,720
it before

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
um and this is a list of of reference to

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,079
the various important parts in here

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,420
including code of conduct as well as

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,500
copyrights Etc

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
so uh important tips given this is

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,340
hybrid meeting we have people in the

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
room and we also have people remotely

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,240
and in order to ensure that we can

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,420
maintain a single cue for comments Etc I

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,579
recommend everyone in the room uses the

51
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,860
meat Echo either the on-site tool there

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,320
are QR codes liberally scattered around

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
the room which take you straight to the

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
on-site version of the uh the tool which

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,920
allows you to join the queue and get

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,239
yourself out of the queue quite quickly

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,959
and easily those of you well it seems a

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
bit strange thing to say those of you

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,379
who are at home dialed into meteco you

60
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,700
need to dial into meteco but um

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,020
if you're listening to the audio streams

62
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,819
there is meteca which gives you a nice

63
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,739
video conferencing facility and you can

64
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,160
see the slides as well information on

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,959
that I believe we put on the next slider

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
up yeah here we go so information on how

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,840
to get access to meet Echo is available

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,860
via the data tracker and the uh

69
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,340
the agenda also has links to it as well

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,480
so

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
um good news we don't have to fill in

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
blue sheets anymore it's all

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,060
automatically done through your uh log

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,980
into the various me take of things

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,620
we we haven't integrated

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,640
um

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,220
note taking facility built into meet

78
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,860
Echo we would like people to use it

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,260
um please make sure that someone is

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,780
collaboratively recording some minutes

81
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,940
if anyone wants to put their hand up and

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
say I want to be the main driver of that

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,440
that would be great otherwise please

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,959
ensure if you're making a point at the

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,920
microphone

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,500
that your name is spelled correctly in

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,599
the minutes and that the the meat of

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,099
what you were trying to say is also

89
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,140
recorded in the minutes just so that

90
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,840
there's no confusion at a later date

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,060
um the link to the uh built-in hedge

92
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,299
dock tool is also on this slide as well

93
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,400
as there's a convenient button in meteco

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,360
as ever uh we have a mailing list it's

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,319
rawatf.org if you need to contact the

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,780
chairs for any reason there's raw hyphen

97
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,180
chairs at ietf.org that is not on the

98
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,239
slide but is in the next tracker and all

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,379
the meeting materials for this session

100
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,940
are also available through the data

101
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,060
track

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,599
so oh formatting has gone great

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
um our agenda for today uh the intro by

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,220
myself and Eve and Eve please just jump

105
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,959
in if you have any comments it's always

106
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,299
difficult

107
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,739
uh we're going to kick off with a

108
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,840
discussion about the eldax draft which

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
is has gone to the isg has had a number

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
of review comments and I'm looking at

111
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,820
John rad here because I think we just

112
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,440
need to have a grown-up conversation

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,199
with you about what do we do now because

114
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,600
we've got a bit stuck between

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
the authors the chairs the working group

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
as a whole and the iesg reviewers and we

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,600
need to think of a way forwards here

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,520
there's been some discussion but I'd

119
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,960
really like to get that resolved but

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,340
meanwhile Niels will do a quick

121
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,380
presentation on on what last minute

122
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
changes have gone in there

123
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,620
Pascal

124
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,680
has a 40-minute slot to talk about the

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540
architecture document for those of you

126
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,160
who aren't aware I hope you're aware

127
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,660
we've had a couple of quite productive

128
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,220
interim meetings talking about the

129
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,800
architecture talking asking ourselves

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,180
some serious questions about what do we

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,160
mean by raw and what should be in this

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,740
initial architecture document and what

133
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,440
should be work items that are going to

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,419
live on in the framework document which

135
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,660
is designed to be a living dock to

136
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,240
describe our thoughts and to capture the

137
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,500
the sort of direction of the working

138
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,120
group to be published at the sort of end

139
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
of this Charter cycle

140
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,539
um so

141
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,520
Pascal's got a nice big slot to talk

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,259
about that because I think it's the meat

143
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,900
of of of the working group's work at the

144
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,160
moment

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,280
um we got a Wi-Fi update from Jerome Ori

146
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,660
I believe or

147
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,639
um being French it may just be Henry I'm

148
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,020
sorry if I've mispronounced your name

149
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,240
talking about what IEEE are doing in

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,580
terms of

151
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,320
reliability in the in the Wi-Fi specs

152
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,360
that are coming Carlos has got a short

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,620
presentation on the on the latest

154
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,539
updates to the use cases document what's

155
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,539
happening with that uh that

156
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,880
I have an apology to make there it was

157
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
looking for a document Shepard for a

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,780
while it was ready to go to isg and the

159
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,940
chairs dropped the ball on that it

160
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,139
should be getting a write-up it should

161
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,600
be ready to go pretty soon so hence just

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,880
a quick one from from Carlos

163
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,960
um he's also presenting about the

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,280
multi-domain extension so that's

165
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,139
reasonably new work and that will be

166
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,840
interesting so looking forward to that

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,000
uh and then Bob muskowitz has asked for

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
a 15-minute slot to talk about

169
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,620
transports that would run over a raw

170
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
slash debt net

171
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,940
Network so once we have built this

172
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,620
technology we've got the control planes

173
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,080
in place we can start to lay down some

174
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,539
reliability from end to end

175
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,639
how do we make transports not do the

176
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,860
dumb thing on top and then break all our

177
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,780
hard work so I can see that being

178
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,660
interesting contentious it may not be

179
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,580
a perfect topic for raw but it's a great

180
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,039
place to start the discussion and I'm

181
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,360
glad we've got a couple of ads in the

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,860
room because I imagine there'll be a

183
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
discussion about does this get shut

184
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,940
across to transport

185
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,220
Etc uh and then we've got 30 minutes

186
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,800
Open Mic which will turn into 30 minutes

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,080
of we've eaten that time by overrunning

188
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,759
constantly but it gives us a bit of

189
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,620
buffer but there'll be a chance for

190
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,180
people to raise any other business at

191
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,940
the end so there we go

192
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,039
would anyone like to bash that agenda at

193
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,180
this point has anyone got something

194
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,060
vital they want to

195
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,560
take to the mic now or should we just

196
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,919
move on

197
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,280
silence is Ascent so we'll move on Eve

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,900
do you want to take over for a second so

199
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,880
I can have a quick drink and just talk

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,780
us through where we are with the

201
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,318
document status

202
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,280
um well I think that you did a very good

203
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,080
job in the intro as well so let's just

204
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,900
review what documents exist and where

205
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,699
they are

206
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,780
um uh as you heard we are hoping to

207
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,259
um uh get some advice and guidance uh

208
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,300
around what our next steps are for the

209
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,740
ldocs document the use case document

210
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,500
um is awaiting the

211
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,660
um the write-up

212
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,599
oh no sorry the use cases is also in the

213
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,740
review

214
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,960
um phase but it's the raw Technologies

215
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,020
document that awaits the write-up

216
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,560
um we have had these uh multiple interim

217
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,780
meetings to make progress on the

218
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,599
architecture document and

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,139
um

220
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,360
so fortunately it is uh shaping up

221
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,879
and we have segregated the framework

222
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,099
which is sort of the future facing what

223
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,160
do we do from the architecture which

224
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,259
kind of outlines what the problem

225
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,360
statement is

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,099
um the RAW oam support document is also

227
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,958
making progress that is something that

228
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,260
has in a previous Incarnation been

229
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,799
separate separated from the detnet oam

230
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,919
document which has been making steady

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,320
progress

232
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,500
we also have an industrial requirements

233
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,360
document

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,839
um that although it is expired at the

235
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,660
moment we did get confirmation from the

236
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,959
authors that they are going to renew

237
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,820
that document and

238
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,640
um we felt that it was pretty close to

239
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,040
submission or at least ready for working

240
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,959
group last call

241
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,519
um as uh Rick had indicated there are

242
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,860
some other documents that are under

243
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,240
consideration that are more recent

244
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,800
um

245
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,420
documents and the there are three of

246
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,380
those

247
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,680
um these fall into Carlos's Camp

248
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,200
um The Joint selection the raw joint

249
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
selection uh uh document that is related

250
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,000
to the Mec technology and then a more

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,540
General MEC technology draft and

252
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,140
um a multi-domain draft that again we

253
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,519
will have a little bit of discussion

254
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,100
about it here today and it also is

255
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,320
getting some discussion

256
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
um elsewhere I believe there's some

257
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,519
discussion about multi-domain in the

258
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,040
detnet agenda as well

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,839
that is our document status

260
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,160
do you want to cover the Milestones

261
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,440
while you're happily talking

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,300
no I think I think I will leave that to

263
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
you it actually appears rather small on

264
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,920
my screen here oh okay no worries so

265
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,480
just a quick update on where we are in

266
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
terms of the chartered Milestones um

267
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,320
short answers we're about halfway

268
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,120
um purely by count

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,620
so

270
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,079
um we've got a sufficient which is good

271
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,360
for a working group to be honest

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,660
um we still have a few more things to to

273
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,360
get ready for the iesg uh one major

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,100
document that that we will approach

275
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,820
towards the end of this Charter cycle is

276
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,920
uh or actually we can start working on

277
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,300
now if there's people who are interested

278
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,399
in contributing to it

279
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,860
in the charter there has there is a line

280
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,079
to say the working group will produce an

281
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,420
evaluation of existing ietf Technologies

282
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,540
and produce a gap analysis document so

283
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,700
this is all about not Reinventing the

284
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,200
wheel and coming up with unique

285
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,940
Solutions based on our understanding of

286
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
the problem space but understanding what

287
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,019
the ietf has already got in its toolbox

288
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,140
to solve some of these OEM issues some

289
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,060
of these control plane issues some of

290
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,560
you know this may cross over entities

291
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,120
this will definitely cross over into

292
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,100
debt debt and to make sure that we're

293
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,720
not inventing yet another protocol

294
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,339
because we didn't talk to anyone else so

295
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,200
volunteers to start that document or

296
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,060
some way to collaboratively work on that

297
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,980
document and it's quite an important

298
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,300
Milestone and I just want to highlight

299
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,360
that to people otherwise we are taking

300
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,040
off Milestones which is good so 50

301
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,579
through

302
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,600
um okay

303
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,860
so uh now we will start on the main

304
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,740
agenda so I think first up is ldax with

305
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,100
uh Niels if you are online I hope you

306
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,040
are I think I saw you earlier uh I will

307
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,540
share your slides and pass you control

308
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,138
sounds very good to me

309
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,760
perfect thank you for the kind

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,800
introduction it's good to be back at the

311
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,060
ITF even remotely in that case I have a

312
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,579
pleasure to present the latest version

313
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,500
of our draft so that's the version 11

314
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,320
actually just this morning we pushed

315
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,540
version 12 because we realized we had

316
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,639
one small typo in it but that's a

317
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,320
different story let's focus on version

318
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,959
11 because the main changes were made

319
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,100
so um as already said uh yes not well I

320
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,339
think you covered that extensively uh

321
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,459
here's the the abstract or uh basically

322
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,120
the front page and compared to last time

323
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,940
um we added one very important sentence

324
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,880
and that is the intent of this document

325
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,700
is to introduce ldx to the IDF Community

326
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,560
raise awareness on related activities

327
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,260
inside and outside of the ITF and to

328
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
seek expertise in shaping the shift of

329
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,560
Aeronautics to AP so what we want to say

330
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,779
as authors of this document is that we

331
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,060
do not bring ldx as an externally

332
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,399
defined data link to the IDF and then

333
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,380
expect that the ITF standardizes the

334
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,440
data link but what we want to do here is

335
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,660
basically inform the ITF and seek

336
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,440
Council on that the entire aeronautical

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,019
communication is now transitioning from

338
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,440
previously analog to proprietary

339
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,959
Solutions now to the IP world and

340
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,360
basically the new data links defined

341
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,420
such as ldx and

342
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,459
as I said we wanted to raise awareness

343
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,260
and and seek counsel on how to proceed

344
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,459
here and this is why we thought it's

345
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,019
very important to mention that right

346
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,120
there in the abstract with the intent of

347
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,699
this document is

348
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,420
um

349
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,220
as you can see there were quite some

350
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,160
changes since last times every blue dots

351
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,079
is one big change actually and

352
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,199
um because we got so many uh reviews and

353
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,740
actually we really have to thank the isg

354
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,839
here for for their hard work because

355
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,699
um I think in the end it was like 40

356
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,899
word pages of emails and and comments

357
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,959
and we incorporated all of the requested

358
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,260
updates and I try to summarize them in

359
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,980
in the in the major issues and those

360
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,800
were that one question is that how is

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
ldx actually interacting with IPv6 and

362
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,160
also um that there was a request on

363
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,540
details on the frame structure and

364
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,019
protocol again the second request was

365
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,600
with IPv6 over ldex how that is handled

366
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,699
and also because ldx is part of a

367
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,320
concept called the future communications

368
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,360
infrastructure and the future

369
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,760
communications infrastructure consists

370
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,940
of set light Communications for Oceanic

371
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,519
called remote domains we have ldax which

372
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,860
will be focused on large-scale

373
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,079
Continental terrestrial Communications

374
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,839
and already rolled out for Airport

375
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,480
communications is the error Max and the

376
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,220
entire idea is basically that you're

377
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,139
able to switch between data links

378
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,320
depending on your needs or if one link

379
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,240
is down you can seamlessly switch to

380
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,720
another so no packets are lost and this

381
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,240
is how the this is why this question was

382
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,079
raised how the FCI is interacting with

383
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,080
ldx and also how Handover works there

384
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,560
[Music]

385
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
um then

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,639
uh several big issues that were

387
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
mentioned were what is the intent of

388
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,259
this document what do we want to do and

389
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,240
um does it pass consensus borrow set by

390
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,820
the RFC 8789

391
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,139
um that's something that the authors

392
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,300
cannot decide this will have to be

393
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,540
decided by the ads or the isg

394
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,120
um and also uh the the security uh part

395
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,720
um had to incorporate IPv6 cons security

396
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,139
concentrations over ldx and there's

397
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,480
another issue that came up unfortunately

398
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,060
many of the aeronautical standards are

399
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,759
behind the paywall so for a further

400
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,500
review

401
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,100
um we can give out those documents uh by

402
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,380
some special access

403
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,779
um but unfortunately as I said these are

404
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,459
behind the table so it's really hard to

405
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,699
review the document if we cite them

406
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,079
directly

407
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,040
so here the um the main answers so what

408
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
is ldx ldx is actually a layer too a

409
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
link layer technology that is

410
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,940
standardized currently with the

411
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,019
international civil aviation

412
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,839
organization and the intent of this

413
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,940
draft is basically to introduce the IP

414
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,800
supporting data link to the ITF

415
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,380
Community because uh simply saying

416
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,480
here's a 400 page document specifying

417
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,839
ldx have fun with it uh didn't really uh

418
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
didn't really seem like a good idea then

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
the second part is that as I said uh

420
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,279
current aeronautical Communications is

421
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,259
transitioning to the IPS that's the

422
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,660
Internet Protocol Suite

423
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,820
um that is currently also defined

424
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,020
um at the Iko and ldx will be one of the

425
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,900
uh access

426
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,980
Technologies enabling that part

427
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,140
um then there was this question with

428
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140
IPv6 so actually just the last two weeks

429
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,459
we had a major flight campaign

430
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,000
demonstrating what ldx can do also with

431
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,280
IPv6 end-to-end connectivity and

432
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,339
demonstrating for instance cpdlc that's

433
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,640
basically a chat application between the

434
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,500
aircraft and the Groundswell pilot and

435
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
air traffic controller and this cpdlc

436
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
was secured by dtls and so yes

437
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,200
everything was done by IPv6 and how that

438
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,760
worked was that ldx defines uh 1536

439
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,220
byte-large user data packets in which

440
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,460
then the IBM 36 traffic is encapsulated

441
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,640
and because Ikea decided that the

442
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,559
transport protocol should be UDP in any

443
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,419
case so basically this is how it Stacks

444
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,400
up them

445
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,559
um then the the handovers because there

446
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,419
was one question we also demonstrated

447
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,100
that during the last two weeks they are

448
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,080
seedless and and basically transparent

449
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,340
to the Appellate so you switch from

450
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,440
ground ground station to another you

451
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,900
don't see any hiccups on the data link

452
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,700
so you don't really experience large

453
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,160
latency uh if if like you're

454
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,780
transitioning from one ground station to

455
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,240
the other it's just you switch over and

456
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,400
the packets go through and you notice

457
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,490
basically nothing

458
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,620
[Music]

459
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,539
um

460
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,799
then as I said with the future

461
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,419
communications infrastructure with the

462
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,220
different data links

463
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,940
um

464
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,860
ldx is is a part of that already

465
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,900
mentioned that and the important thing

466
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,020
here is that there's also a Mobility

467
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,720
solution envisioned now for the in IP

468
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,460
Mobility solution and vision for the

469
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,500
entire thing so for the flight campaign

470
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,840
we used for the Access Network payment

471
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,720
V6 and then for the FCI multi-link

472
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,740
concept there's current work going on to

473
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,059
um use a list based Mobility solution

474
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,820
for switching between FCI links however

475
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,039
this is not a part that is obviously

476
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,980
standardized Itself by ldx but is is

477
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,960
some idea that ldex will play a part in

478
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
then the last two things

479
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,500
um ldx as a link layer has

480
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,200
um security defined for user and control

481
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,100
plane so before an aircraft can actually

482
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,720
successfully communicate with ground

483
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,240
Mutual authentication between ground and

484
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,820
aircraft are happening already on the

485
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,880
link layer because the the radio is is

486
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,100
the first to make contact between air

487
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
and ground so there will be mutual

488
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,360
authentication and key establishment key

489
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,919
derivation and from there we have

490
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
necessary keys to secure user data on

491
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
the link layer but also the control days

492
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,240
of ldx and this will also majorly help

493
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,280
in integrity and authenticity protecting

494
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,280
the the necessary control messages over

495
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,159
the air gap and the last Point as I

496
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,799
already said so for future reviews or in

497
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,419
case anyone in the audience is

498
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,400
interested for reviewing this document

499
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,500
we can provide the standards behind the

500
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,120
paywalls for review purposes only

501
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,360
um now I use already a lot of my time so

502
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,159
let me be brief with with the rest of

503
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,020
the presentation

504
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,240
um what did we change in the text so as

505
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,799
I said first part in the introduction

506
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,280
what is the actual intent uh of of this

507
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,039
document I would recovered that

508
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,500
um the second part was so we were asked

509
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,840
um that determinology uh chapter 2

510
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
should be renamed acronyms and also we

511
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,080
streamlined that the next part was

512
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
um that we would ask what sources are

513
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,159
available what standards are available

514
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,000
where can find out hey house IPv6 over

515
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,860
um either eldex or any other uh

516
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,140
multi-link candidate handled so we added

517
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,200
in the references were applicable and

518
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,260
also to the FCI and it states the links

519
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,600
then the applicability

520
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,580
I already said that so within the ldx

521
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,380
access network local Mobility solution

522
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,140
will be payment V6 and within the sci

523
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,820
the global Mobility solution we were

524
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,340
implemented on top of lisp and we had

525
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,440
some questions about the AP and T which

526
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,840
is um that you can use ldx also for

527
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,720
navigational purposes and if you have

528
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,940
several class stations and you know the

529
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,860
channel quality you know their exact

530
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,320
position you can basically

531
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
um navigate VIA aldex which has also

532
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,919
been demonstrated already 2019.

533
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,940
um next part was how is the setup so

534
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,679
um this is with the characteristics here

535
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,080
on the right hand side the the H uh the

536
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,360
ATN is the aeronautical traffic Network

537
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
so that's uh where traffic controllers

538
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,280
put in their traffic then the air ground

539
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,380
router is interface to the access

540
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,640
network

541
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,360
um then we have the several ground

542
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,900
stations uh connected by a control plane

543
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,580
but also user plane and the ground

544
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,100
station is the actual ldex ground radio

545
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,220
connected to the aircraft done

546
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,820
um for the protocol stack I would refer

547
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,640
to the draft if you're interested in

548
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,620
finding out more details but we updated

549
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,700
that now

550
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,760
um to include all kind of control uh

551
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,659
traffic

552
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,299
um which hasn't been included before

553
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,000
about reliability in the availability of

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,980
a clarified that priorities are managed

555
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,460
by the diffserv classes uh csr1 is the

556
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,380
lowest priority series of highest

557
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,480
priority so we have um prioritization

558
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
between eight different traffic classes

559
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,260
that ldx supports and um multiple ground

560
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,940
stations available visible to the

561
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,580
aircraft at the same time so for the

562
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,559
cell planning it's absolutely possible

563
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,900
let's say one ground station is down for

564
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,419
maintenance uh the the signal power is

565
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,679
strong enough

566
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,780
um that I think if even foreground

567
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,659
stations within the same regions are cut

568
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,880
out you can then seamlessly simply

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,620
switch to the fifth and still continue

570
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,100
Service as usual

571
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,799
um for security uh something very

572
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,179
important that I wanted to mention here

573
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,640
so what's the security requirements for

574
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,940
ldx and to put it in a nutshell to

575
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,620
provide a secure Channel between the

576
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,299
Airborne radio system and the peer radio

577
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,100
access endpoints on the ground to ensure

578
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,620
authentication Integrity of air ground

579
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,380
message exchanges so basically entity

580
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,360
authentication falls under this category

581
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,059
and then establishing Keys deriving them

582
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,000
and using them to secure especially

583
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,860
authenticity and integrity of their

584
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,799
Grant messages uh confidentiality is

585
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,440
something only kept for certain kind of

586
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,210
traffic actually

587
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,740
[Music]

588
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,460
um

589
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,100
now I'm at the end of my presentation

590
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,320
and now my questions to through the

591
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,600
chess so we worked extensively on on

592
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,520
this document over the last three months

593
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,760
I think we covered every

594
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,059
um every aspect that we could cover by

595
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,340
the comments and now the question is how

596
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,520
do we proceed from here on out so thank

597
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,260
you very much for your attention and I'm

598
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,200
really happy for a short discussion

599
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,900
thanks Niels so

600
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm sure those of you subscribe to the

601
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,159
mailing list will have seen a number of

602
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,700
messages from myself from Eve from John

603
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,900
so

604
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,760
some of the feedback we got from the

605
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,700
iasg review was this is a very nicely

606
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,740
written document and explains this

607
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,200
technology in an interesting way

608
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,440
is it relevant to the ietf and how much

609
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,620
has the working group actually read and

610
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,500
agreed around the validity of this

611
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,740
document as a raw working group document

612
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,380
because searching back through the

613
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,059
mailing list archive

614
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,220
some of the reviewers said there doesn't

615
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,840
seem to have been much discussion on

616
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,860
this

617
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,340
so a pole of the room and online quite

618
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,539
quickly I'm going to try and see if I

619
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,760
can use the polling button actually

620
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,779
um

621
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,020
how many people have read this document

622
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,840
not necessarily the latest version but a

623
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,000
version of this document and we use the

624
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,480
show hands tools so we can we can

625
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,779
have you read ldx

626
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,740
question mode

627
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,080
so I'm going to give that a couple of

628
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,059
seconds because this is one of the

629
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,679
critical questions we need to answer

630
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,360
back to the isg reviewers

631
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,419
I'm going to make it quick

632
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,179
I'm going to stop it at that point so

633
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,539
we've got 13 yes H didn't bother to

634
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,460
raise their hands we got 21 participants

635
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,440
so

636
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,940
I think that's a result to take back to

637
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,260
the isg I'm not going to try and

638
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,600
interpret that result but it's not too

639
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,500
um out of 21.

640
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,460
the next question really was is this

641
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,480
document

642
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
which is

643
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,940
a description of the ldx technology of

644
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,039
relevance and as I understand the

645
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,799
author's pitch that is written to be

646
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,539
relevant to the raw working group and

647
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,820
the ietf as a whole so that we can

648
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,760
understand the capabilities of ldax as

649
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,400
an input to any deterministic networking

650
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,580
over wireless media mediums that we

651
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,740
might want to do I think that's the

652
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,659
purpose is not to say

653
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,480
this is ldx's and ietf Technology it's

654
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,059
this is ldax it could be useful as part

655
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,760
of this larger L3 stuff we're talking

656
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,159
about go on Lou louburger I suggest you

657
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,500
redo the poll uh some of us were not on

658
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,840
the tool and you've now jumped to 39

659
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,539
people in the room oh my Lord okay so do

660
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,460
that poll again yeah and I'll leave it

661
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,539
I'll leave it running longer

662
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,400
have you read

663
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,500
ldx part two

664
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,440
hold on I can't type and speak

665
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,480
thank you

666
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,340
okay can you raise your hand again even

667
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,020
if you did on the previous one because I

668
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,299
have messed up but I'll leave that

669
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,919
running a little bit longer I'm looking

670
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,059
at John rad is my summary of my

671
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,559
understanding of the review comments

672
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,200
accurate yeah I think that's perfect

673
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,320
sorry yes I think that's that's perfect

674
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,840
I mean in fact I put my hand up earlier

675
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,460
to stand up and comment and you said

676
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,500
everything I wanted to say substantially

677
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,059
so I took my hand down yes I think

678
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,110
that's right

679
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,000
[Music]

680
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,520
so my question or even my question and

681
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,100
actually echoing the authors here what

682
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,980
do we do now to unblock this and I and I

683
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,480
know I'm slightly unfairly looking at

684
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,179
you John and I'm and I'm we're in a bit

685
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,640
of an an impasse when it comes to the to

686
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,980
the isg here right no I think you're

687
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,220
fairly looking at me it's uh um but uh

688
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,290
right so

689
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,279
[Music]

690
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,279
uh you you highlighted exactly the right

691
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,340
question because all of the other things

692
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,480
that nil summarized in his presentation

693
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,399
essentially take care of

694
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,559
essentially all of the discussed

695
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,600
comments that were that were gathered uh

696
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
there was one procedural one that was up

697
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,039
to me to take care of and that one is

698
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,520
also sorted so really the question comes

699
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,880
completely down to

700
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
do we have consensus within this working

701
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,580
group that this is something that we

702
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,640
want to basically all the stuff you just

703
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,860
said yeah so

704
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,480
um

705
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,820
and as far as I know as again as you

706
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,700
summarize to date we don't really have a

707
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,380
documented

708
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,360
trail that says so

709
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,240
um so I think the way to break that Log

710
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,899
Jam is if everybody who raised their

711
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,779
hand which is a decent number of people

712
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,460
and it certainly as you said larger than

713
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,140
two

714
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,860
um would take the additional time

715
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,600
um maybe this afternoon

716
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,659
uh to write a short email

717
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,120
to the list

718
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,520
expressing their comments you know

719
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,100
whether good bad or indifferent about

720
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,440
the uh the suitability of moving the

721
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,899
document forward and Publishing it that

722
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,299
would help tremendously

723
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,840
um and I think that if that is done

724
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,419
um I don't

725
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:32,399
foresee a problem I mean assuming that

726
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,279
the consensus is positive of course but

727
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,539
if that all happens I don't see any you

728
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,260
know

729
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,000
structural difficulty with go ahead

730
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,120
going ahead and moving to publication

731
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,039
um that of course assumes if you know

732
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,740
I'd forgive me I haven't gone in and

733
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,640
reviewed all of the changes and so you

734
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,620
know I we'll need to go and negotiate

735
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,240
with each person who's ready to discuss

736
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,760
and ensure that they're satisfied with

737
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,460
the resolution of their discuss but I I

738
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,260
you know I have confidence that that's

739
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,760
possible

740
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,740
um the only thing that's really a

741
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,600
sticking point is is what you were

742
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,039
talking about

743
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,919
yeah so does it have consensus and

744
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,720
review from the working group was was

745
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,000
kind of the Crux of the question so

746
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,980
please put some comment on the waiting

747
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,559
list because that is then evidencing and

748
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,480
then we can have a strong argument with

749
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,279
the isg about that go ahead Bob you're

750
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,419
in the queue

751
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,880
um I am being dragged screaming not

752
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,100
necessarily kicking more into this space

753
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,640
as my work in ik all

754
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,740
and uh look I have not given this

755
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,020
document the full review that I need to

756
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,059
give but I've given a very cursory view

757
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,419
so far and I'm wondering if you know I

758
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,520
don't want to delay things necessarily

759
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,960
but perhaps some text

760
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,799
as consideration guidance and raw in

761
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,179
what

762
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,059
the experience of ldax

763
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,980
provides

764
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,659
to Raw in general in terms of how you

765
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,620
look at the wireless side of it so that

766
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,039
any other Wireless group as I'm I'm

767
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,919
aware of some other

768
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,380
Wireless bands which are allocated which

769
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,179
have not done fine Mac at all yet

770
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,159
nothing to worry about yet how to share

771
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,240
it but sorry

772
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,580
um we have a use cases document which

773
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,860
does draw out some of the avionics use

774
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,559
cases and and does make mention of ldx

775
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,019
we also have the Technologies document

776
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,600
which does a broad view across Wi-Fi

777
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,740
Technologies and also you know 5G Etc it

778
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,480
also includes a section on ldx so I

779
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,039
think some of that information already

780
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,140
exists but it's in the wrong place

781
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,899
because you're evaluating the ldax

782
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,019
document and so neldax document needs to

783
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:57,659
either reference that over there or

784
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,760
replicate enough of it so that when

785
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,519
somebody's reading the ldx document they

786
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,519
know how to put in the context

787
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,039
I'm looking at Nielsen the camera to uh

788
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,019
to see if he has any feedback on that

789
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,299
does that make sense to you Niels or do

790
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,740
you what do you think about that

791
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,960
suggestion first off can you put that

792
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,480
text on the mailing list please evidence

793
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,940
of value discussion right I'm going to

794
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,640
do that obviously not because I got but

795
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
I will see to it hopefully before the

796
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,480
end of the day

797
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,760
I see Karina in the queue who is one of

798
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,559
the co-authors so I I think Neil

799
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,539
sustained quiet on purpose

800
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,640
go ahead curtain

801
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,059
uh well I just wanted to say something

802
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,100
to it uh yes that's right there's a

803
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,740
linkage between those two documents and

804
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,679
within our ldx version we have a

805
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,899
cross-reference to the other document as

806
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,659
it was requested and discussed within

807
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,880
the different itfs before

808
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,760
there is a cross a reference completely

809
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,419
into these use case stuff

810
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,220
it tends to get pulled for other reason

811
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,960
to say oh we really extremely put that

812
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,820
back in I need to be a little bit close

813
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,220
to the mic pop sorry I've encountered

814
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,720
this before where something gets pulled

815
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,159
from a document as you're progressing

816
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,960
and then when you get to the end you say

817
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
oh we really shouldn't DePaul that that

818
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,760
needs to get maybe put back in valid

819
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,080
points can you can you take that to the

820
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,519
list yeah yeah I'm just going to double

821
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,380
check and answer your question yes yes

822
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,120
with reference to the actual line yeah

823
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,640
yeah now I'm encountering at my own work

824
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,019
and saying well you got to read all

825
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,000
these other documents

826
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,820
and they're saying well you need to have

827
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,220
some text at least here to tell me what

828
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,659
to read in those other documents

829
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,019
thanks

830
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,299
um

831
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,019
does anyone else have any comment on

832
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,539
ldax I'm gonna I'm gonna reiterate

833
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,940
please make comments to the mailing list

834
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,860
so there is evidence that we have

835
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,019
considered and discussed this I wanna

836
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,700
I'll add one extra comment sort of

837
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,260
targeted towards the ads not

838
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,419
particularly John but any others who

839
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:01,740
will be listening to this recording at

840
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,480
some later date

841
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,140
I can foresee other documents like this

842
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,659
probably not as long or as complete

843
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,480
about other Wireless Technologies and

844
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,320
how they are applicable within the Raw

845
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,119
landscape appearing you know something

846
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,020
about perhaps how to use the ultra low

847
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,139
ultra low latency 5G capabilities how to

848
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,839
use TSN in an elegant way

849
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,500
um

850
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,179
those will still be documents talking

851
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,219
about other people's Technologies

852
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:35,159
but will be valid inputs to whatever

853
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,940
control plane protocols or other OEM

854
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,918
bits and pieces we develop in raw so

855
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,800
this isn't a unique case as I see it it

856
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,020
just happens to be the first one so

857
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,119
cool uh thank you very much Niels

858
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:51,960
um

859
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,520
I will try and find out what I'm doing

860
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,900
with miteko and Pascal I think it's over

861
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,820
to you if you are online I can't see you

862
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,680
on the list I hope yeah he's there great

863
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,940
so I'll

864
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,280
I'll share the slides and past the bat

865
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,940
on to you

866
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,420
Pascal are you there

867
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,400
sorry yes

868
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,640
um so there's one thing uh Rick is that

869
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,359
you know Luke suggested that and he was

870
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,099
right right that I I should have

871
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,099
included his words uh or the discussion

872
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,500
that we started in the mailing list in

873
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,119
the slides and I was in the process of

874
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,880
doing that and then mostly done but I'm

875
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,359
not fully done and the new slides with

876
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,859
you know the only difference being the

877
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,079
inclusion of what of you know what I

878
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,420
could after discussion with Lou they're

879
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,900
only on my desk so the the best way for

880
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,720
me would be basically to present from my

881
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,960
desk if that's okay yeah yeah fine I'll

882
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,000
stop sharing you you click the buttons

883
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,740
and I will I will approve you sharing

884
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,119
your screen or whatever I have to do so

885
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,640
so okay okay okay okay

886
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,078
so let's do that

887
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
um

888
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,760
so share

889
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,260
so it says oh it should showing slides

890
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,720
but it's not sharing the

891
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
local desktop screen if you want to

892
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,579
share off your desktop

893
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,480
okay yeah

894
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,079
to do

895
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,800
wow

896
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,920
so I'm not sure which screen is which

897
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,260
screen it says share screen does not

898
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,380
indicate what screen that is

899
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,359
okay it's not the right one

900
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,980
black

901
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,940
we're getting there

902
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,180
okay so with this you should be seeing

903
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,160
my slides do you see my slides full

904
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,180
screen

905
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,099
yes we do

906
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,040
okay so we we don't have that much time

907
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,220
considering what we need to discuss

908
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,160
thanks to balash and Lou actually for

909
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,260
the most piece but also due to the

910
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,740
discussions that that we've been having

911
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,280
um in the interim Etc so I will pass the

912
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,420
classical introduction to the

913
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,880
architecture just remember that we are

914
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,460
defining a UDA Loop where we basically

915
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,570
observe and act

916
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,339
[Music]

917
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,000
um

918
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,280
in order to adapt to the physical

919
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,200
condition and mostly of the wireless

920
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,599
medium because that's the wireless which

921
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,660
really changes very rapidly uh versus

922
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,920
you know what we experience

923
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,900
traditionally in wire

924
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,079
and so we we've done uh 28 years ago we

925
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,079
decided to split the architecture and

926
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,300
the framework understanding that the

927
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,760
architecture is more of

928
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,760
what we intend to do and the global kind

929
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,160
of scope and Broad picture blueprint

930
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,619
whatever of what you want to do whereas

931
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,440
the framework is more on how you know

932
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,660
which techniques we put in place which

933
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,599
draft we develop etc etc so the

934
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,000
framework as we Define it is mostly

935
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,099
something that will be available in the

936
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,660
end of our project whereas the

937
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,700
architecture is the thing that we need

938
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,079
to provide at the beginning of the

939
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,599
project to scope it and and provide the

940
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,839
directions that we're taking

941
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,560
so since the split we did a number of

942
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,280
uh additions and we are

943
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,380
um we were we've been discussing uh

944
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,000
since last age of whether we are ready

945
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,099
for our group let's go I think we are

946
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,400
mostly ready and and the kind of

947
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,180
um review I just got from balash for me

948
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,859
is the level of what Google Plus call

949
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,040
with you now that mostly

950
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,020
um on the other hand what we got from

951
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,780
Lou needs to be debated a little bit

952
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,839
more and I guess it's pretty welcome so

953
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,260
so I'd like actually to go through both

954
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,140
sets of comments but yes we need to

955
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,020
resolve those issues

956
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,300
um the things that change the things

957
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,859
that we've detailed more and then I'm

958
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:38,700
not 100 sure that uh this level is the

959
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,900
one that balance has reviewed

960
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,480
effectively but with uh at the end time

961
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
we discussed that we needed to provide

962
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,579
more information about

963
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,720
um how rofits versus lower layers and

964
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,320
how row fits uh within that net

965
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,640
so ISRO a piece of that net for instance

966
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
uh like so some new components some new

967
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,500
subsets of of that net and effectively

968
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,380
that's how we position Raw uh knowing

969
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,960
that at the moment rho is Rich altering

970
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,920
but was not so far working on the

971
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,140
controller plane and effectively we are

972
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,660
we hope that map will be working on the

973
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,960
control plane because row needs needs uh

974
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,800
new functions in in the new basically

975
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,859
control plane function cpfs in that net

976
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,079
so we'll be fully within that net when

977
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,000
that net is shut out to work on the cpf

978
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,980
as well

979
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,839
for now we kind of indicate a row

980
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,619
control sub layer where

981
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,180
the PSE stands and also the the

982
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,040
interaction with the the pce that will

983
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,119
provide

984
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,560
uh the possible subtracts for going

985
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,200
around different types of failures

986
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,359
so we basically Act

987
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,540
in this

988
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,859
uh Contra plane and we we act in the

989
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,140
service sub layer where we we take

990
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,540
actions for instance for parallel and we

991
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,800
also

992
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,280
um get the result of our OEM observes

993
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,339
and and we act in the forning sub layer

994
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:22,319
mostly you know us users of OEM

995
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,619
so this is this is the architecture now

996
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,079
when you focus on the PSC the PSE is

997
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,020
mostly in the control sub layer

998
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,260
um and well this is how I see it but

999
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,940
something that we need to debate because

1000
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,980
basically the piece the PSC makes

1001
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,460
decision it's it's controlling uh and

1002
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,740
it's the companion of the PC so in my

1003
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,000
view it makes sense to to consider the

1004
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,940
PLC as control sub layer now the text is

1005
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,220
not fully homogeneous with that and even

1006
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,260
the rewrite that we were discussing for

1007
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,300
the abstract is not fully homogeneous is

1008
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,460
that so we we need to agree and that

1009
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,839
would be one point of discussion

1010
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,079
basically on this structure it kind of

1011
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,319
fits within the commands from banash so

1012
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,480
how do we position within that net so we

1013
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,040
are within that net but exactly in more

1014
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,000
details do we have PCF well cpf control

1015
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,760
plane function do we have a sub layer

1016
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,319
and what do we do in the in the death

1017
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:22,079
net service layer under the net for

1018
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
example

1019
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,520
so so this is the way it's drawn right

1020
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,400
now in the architecture and maybe I need

1021
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,720
to do a pass to make sure that all the

1022
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
text is aligned with this so so would

1023
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,020
you have some commands on that slide

1024
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,160
already because it's it's quite

1025
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,640
important

1026
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,119
and I hope it's clear that on the left

1027
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,839
the big square is the end system where

1028
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,060
rho makes the increase of the truck

1029
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,640
basically and the Box on the right the

1030
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,160
relay node is what we may be doing

1031
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,920
inside the network if there is a relay a

1032
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,859
definite relay that supports Raw in

1033
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,319
particular you see on the top right that

1034
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,140
the PSC could be completely

1035
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,319
running on the Ingress and and signaling

1036
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,000
stuff in the packets that has to be

1037
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,060
implemented by the parallel actuator in

1038
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,920
in the relay node

1039
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,520
but it can also be distributed

1040
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,400
optionally so that some more decision

1041
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,740
could be made along the path and the

1042
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,980
architecture allows both models

1043
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,660
we mostly discussed the model where the

1044
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,760
PSC is at the Ingress and there is some

1045
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,319
kind of source right information inside

1046
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,599
the packet to indicate what to do next

1047
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,700
but the architecture is is wider than

1048
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,119
that you could effectively uh learn from

1049
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,579
OEM inside the relay

1050
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,040
and make decision for the rest of the

1051
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,079
way inside the relay

1052
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,760
Pascal we've got a couple of people at

1053
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,760
the queue so I can see them because I'm

1054
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,980
sharing my screen so can you please

1055
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,859
relay the questions to me

1056
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:00,180
go ahead Luke sure uh I I my intent was

1057
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,040
actually to wait until you sort of went

1058
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
through your material before jumping

1059
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,880
into the questions that really had been

1060
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,500
on the list

1061
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,540
um but you said you want to discuss this

1062
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,819
now am I understanding you correctly or

1063
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,339
do you want to well because we have the

1064
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,500
matter in front of us I ever call you so

1065
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,060
much of questions in the slides later

1066
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,300
but if we answer them that that point

1067
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,060
now maybe it's good I mean let's fire

1068
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,859
fire out here I think since we are there

1069
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:27,300
yes please

1070
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,180
okay so on this slide there's two

1071
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,040
fundamental pieces I'm going to go with

1072
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,740
the smaller issue first and then get to

1073
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,359
the larger one and maybe I'll take the

1074
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,040
larger one after Carlos to give him a

1075
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,380
chance to you know not to hog the queue

1076
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,599
so the smaller one it was a question

1077
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,420
that just I added in this mail from

1078
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,220
yesterday uh which is is Paro uh or the

1079
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,480
arq piece required or not

1080
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,720
for raw

1081
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,640
oh bio includes pre-off right skin of a

1082
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,859
super set of pre-off and row or the PSC

1083
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:12,660
for the most piece controls the Barrio

1084
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,220
the the bio is the act in the UDA Loop

1085
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,040
the a of the UDA Loop is bio

1086
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,720
so if we in terms of architecture

1087
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,280
is part of the architecture because we

1088
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,319
need to see we need to say what the PSC

1089
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,780
does now in terms of definition of the

1090
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,240
PSC as you can see on this Slide the PSC

1091
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,339
is control

1092
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:38,220
the uh bio is service

1093
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,220
so you could say

1094
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,500
well in the architecture it fits in the

1095
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,780
global Road design we need to to specify

1096
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,000
it in terms of components it doesn't

1097
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,040
belong to the PSE it it's it's

1098
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,560
controlled by the PLC does it make sense

1099
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,420
is that is that your view

1100
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,520
so and you can see me looking left is

1101
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,380
because now I've got Lou on the screen

1102
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,180
here that's why you see me looking on

1103
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,800
the left sorry Lou but when I look at

1104
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,420
you I'm looking left I'm actually

1105
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,040
looking at your slide so wherever you

1106
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,500
look this works for me

1107
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,280
um it's interesting you said A is for

1108
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,180
act

1109
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,180
in the document it says A is for R A or

1110
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,680
Q

1111
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,180
oh I'm sorry a in UDA

1112
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,839
okay let's go back today I agree uh but

1113
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,619
uh right the action in the UDA Loop is

1114
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,040
what the prayer of power does

1115
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,960
right but so just is I'm really asking a

1116
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,099
narrow question I have a bigger question

1117
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,280
but the more narrow question is the arq

1118
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,540
piece a fundamental component of raw

1119
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,260
or not and there's two flavors okay so

1120
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,720
no

1121
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,720
let me answer that please okay so the

1122
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,540
the we it's it needs to be abstracted

1123
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,000
executively that's one place where you

1124
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,460
will be very helpful

1125
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,240
um

1126
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,480
we don't do arq in row

1127
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,700
we signal

1128
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,500
possibly

1129
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,619
some these are r q

1130
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,980
behave Behavior to the lower layer if

1131
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,220
the lower layer can consume that and do

1132
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,740
something out of it it will if we cannot

1133
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,720
if it doesn't care we cannot pass that

1134
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,160
information to the lower layer it worked

1135
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,900
but it's for us it's kind of an abstract

1136
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,180
thing we don't know how the lower layout

1137
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,400
that they are q and we don't do arq at

1138
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,680
the row layer it's just some information

1139
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,559
like like and that's part of my response

1140
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,059
to balance as well I think you've got

1141
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,700
this point in common how comes that

1142
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,500
parallel discuss this thing that look

1143
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,520
like to the lower layer we just hit

1144
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,700
the type of Piezo that we expect

1145
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,359
and if the lower layer

1146
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,180
support something supports an API it's

1147
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,859
like the L2 triggers but the other way

1148
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,260
down if the lower layer supports that

1149
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,300
and that's on it fine if it does not too

1150
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,480
bad

1151
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,260
I like I like your answer a lot and I

1152
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,660
think I'm completely aligned with it I

1153
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,559
don't think that's what the document

1154
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,000
says

1155
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,280
okay let me let me revise the document

1156
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,079
in this I mean I need to somebody please

1157
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,119
write that down but yes we need we need

1158
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,980
and if it was listed in your latest

1159
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,380
thing in latest mail I need to answer

1160
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,300
that but basically that's that's the way

1161
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,920
I view it yeah if we aren't saying that

1162
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,900
we need to to look at that text and make

1163
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,599
sure that we we say that

1164
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,460
okay just gonna step into this point

1165
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,300
Luke

1166
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,640
rather than requesting a change to some

1167
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,680
specific text could you suggest some

1168
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,140
changes to specific text yeah you're

1169
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,599
still welcome you've been Fiverr but

1170
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,680
you're still

1171
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,760
yeah

1172
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,900
so uh sure we'll see what happens I

1173
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,520
actually have more substantive comments

1174
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,440
I'm going to wait until Carlos that's

1175
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,740
okay

1176
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,480
[Music]

1177
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,079
yes I have just a kind of a request that

1178
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,660
um I think for for me uh maybe for other

1179
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,760
people it will be helpful exercise to

1180
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,760
try to do an example of how this

1181
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,000
architecture view will work like with

1182
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
actual you know uh and and notes of flow

1183
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,859
and how that will what what type of

1184
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,540
interactions

1185
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,660
that will imply in a what I would call

1186
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,579
Pure Roy scenario

1187
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:38,579
and what I will call a row plus dead net

1188
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,800
scenario which may have implications

1189
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,079
also in the multi-domain thing because

1190
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,160
we can consider a dead net pure.net wire

1191
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,079
a scenarios one domain and a more

1192
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,680
Wireless scenariosa another domain but

1193
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,440
for me will be next uh very useful at

1194
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,020
ssis and I think it may help other

1195
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,059
people and the discussion to have that

1196
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:01,500
type of example

1197
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,420
so do you mean in terms of some sort of

1198
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,260
signaling sequence diagram yes yeah so

1199
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,020
we can see basically the the function

1200
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,319
that Pascal put there how they interact

1201
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,180
between each other among each other and

1202
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,920
we can see that the actual data flow and

1203
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,400
control flow so there are a number of

1204
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,099
drawings already in a document maybe we

1205
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,780
can build on that

1206
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,660
to achieve what you want some of them

1207
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,460
were there for a while some of them are

1208
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,480
very new

1209
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,940
and so uh

1210
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,800
but when we go through these drawings

1211
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,040
maybe I can you know ask you if that's a

1212
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,660
good start for what you want to achieve

1213
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,980
or if what you want to achieve is

1214
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,900
completely new versus what we already

1215
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,119
have in both in both cases I'm

1216
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,760
completely open yeah that we don't I

1217
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,859
don't want to go too far because if we

1218
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,900
if we give too much details we are in

1219
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,900
the framework framework world right and

1220
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,720
if maybe what you what you want we

1221
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,160
should start writing it in the framework

1222
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,000
but not the architecture we we I just we

1223
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,980
need to express the basically the boxes

1224
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,319
and the flows how things interact we

1225
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,180
don't want to go into too much details

1226
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,540
of how that happens

1227
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,819
to clarify for me these diagrams I don't

1228
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,619
care at this point where they go it's

1229
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,280
just an exercise for us to to go I mean

1230
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,900
to progress and then we can discuss

1231
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,520
whether this will go in one document or

1232
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,780
other document but I think it's useful

1233
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,240
for us to progress on this exercise

1234
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,040
and at the same point and I agree with

1235
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,140
with Carlos on this I think having those

1236
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,260
diagrams is important whether they go in

1237
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,240
this document or the framework is a

1238
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,040
secondary matter but I think it gives us

1239
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,640
some scope for Clear understanding of as

1240
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,960
we progress

1241
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,880
a point of order

1242
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,260
Pascal do you want to take more

1243
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,020
questions now and yes is your question

1244
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,880
about this particular slide or is it a

1245
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,559
more General one because I think Lou's

1246
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,900
question is more General yeah I had a

1247
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,819
similar question like it was like do we

1248
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,740
want to have the open mic discussion now

1249
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,680
I have related comments and more generic

1250
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,079
ones so Pascal what would you like to do

1251
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,680
continue There was loose big command

1252
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,500
and I I think we need to hear it because

1253
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,839
Lou has been very polite to go to the

1254
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,640
end of the queue but

1255
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,280
and then you know if you think I I'll

1256
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,359
take it you know it's going to be your

1257
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,280
choice if you if you think that this

1258
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,440
slide that we are presenting is the one

1259
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,300
that fits your discussion then let's

1260
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,400
take it otherwise maybe we can hold it

1261
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,400
till we have a better slide for it

1262
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,020
yeah I I haven't looked through your

1263
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,780
package so I don't know uh which side is

1264
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,180
best but it's a general comment about uh

1265
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,040
my comment is is an architectural and

1266
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,140
like Janos or I shouldn't say

1267
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,940
architecture more fundamental is you're

1268
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,680
defining a whole lot of new terminology

1269
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,859
for things that already exist in the ITF

1270
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:52,500
and you know Rick said at the beginning

1271
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,720
one of the things we want to do in our

1272
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,240
reviews is try not to

1273
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,640
invent new terminology and new things

1274
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,740
for stuff we already do and I feel like

1275
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,119
we're doing that in the architecture and

1276
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,920
that's the discussion I want to have I

1277
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,599
really would feel more comfortable if we

1278
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,880
do that at the end yeah so that you have

1279
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,339
yeah

1280
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:12,839
from your commands

1281
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,059
typically on the te thing

1282
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,460
so I have that slide and that's really

1283
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,619
one of the reasons why I'm presenting

1284
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,720
from my desk as opposed to the package

1285
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,339
that's already there because you know

1286
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:24,720
you basically interviewed me that I

1287
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,940
should have done that like yesterday and

1288
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,859
there was a lot of my in my plate since

1289
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:32,400
then so I I was not finished to be able

1290
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,900
to push it in time for for

1291
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,400
let's keep going through your side deck

1292
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,380
and we'll take these sort of general

1293
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,740
purpose comments at the end then okay

1294
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,339
so

1295
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,099
this is a picture that is newer right

1296
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,559
and this is also a discussion that we

1297
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,460
add at the interim is how does row fit

1298
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,780
within that net and if you remember

1299
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,480
we've got two major use cases one where

1300
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,880
we've got that net service end to end

1301
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,579
and row just integrates with that in

1302
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,260
which case we do the control and our

1303
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,579
additions to the death net Services

1304
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,520
basically and you know if we ignore that

1305
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,880
we do some special stuff in oam and we

1306
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,280
we agree that maybe the oam is

1307
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,200
completely part of that net and whatever

1308
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,599
we do is rid of it in netnet then we can

1309
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,940
really abstract this as end-to-end.net

1310
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,559
Services scattered row plus

1311
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,079
sorry that net forwarding end to end uh

1312
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,660
that net services in in some nodes which

1313
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,000
are called relays and in those relays we

1314
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,160
expect row as well and then row control

1315
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,579
maybe only a decrease or possibly uh

1316
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:45,839
also uh optionally at the relays if if

1317
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,180
the PLC is distributed so this is one

1318
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,799
model that's the one that we use for

1319
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,319
instance in in the case of a mesh where

1320
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,420
we build what we call a track and then

1321
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,160
for which there is this discussion about

1322
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,200
terminology

1323
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,180
um so so that's one model and that's the

1324
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,880
most classical model outside now there

1325
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,859
is another model that we didn't have at

1326
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:06,599
the beginning that but number of people

1327
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,059
insisted that we work on it it's the

1328
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,079
model where row mostly controls the RAM

1329
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,940
and the Run by run I mean the radio

1330
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,700
access network Wi-Fi and there was a

1331
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,260
picture of my ballast actually in in

1332
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,359
just the email he sent two days ago

1333
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,059
where you can see the the device like

1334
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,880
the user equipment or something uh doing

1335
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,720
5G or doing Wi-Fi and possibly if it's a

1336
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,720
robot having a fiber as well and

1337
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,780
deciding which network to use and

1338
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,460
depending on the access that's using

1339
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,559
that net may be available end to end

1340
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,440
might be available but not falling I

1341
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,520
mean might be available uh only uh

1342
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,700
all the way to the the end of the 5G

1343
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,500
network but not across the internet to

1344
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,780
the application which is more like this

1345
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,700
picture or could be just not there and

1346
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,119
so if it's not there then uh not end to

1347
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,220
end then we cannot provide them to end

1348
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,780
guarantees

1349
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,140
and uh for at least for timeliness and

1350
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,619
and time latency quantities we cannot

1351
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,660
provide them because we really depend on

1352
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,839
that net and our layers to provide uh

1353
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,299
timeliness basically

1354
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:24,000
in that case row is still useful because

1355
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,420
row can do end to end or am you know

1356
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,640
between the Ingress and system and

1357
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,799
degrees and system and measure whatever

1358
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:33,599
it sees depending on which Access

1359
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,520
Network it's using the replication

1360
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,420
across Wi-Fi 5G whatever is needed and

1361
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,940
you know if it finds that using two

1362
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,099
Wi-Fi interfaces is enough and 5G is

1363
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,280
expensive or on the control e5g is so

1364
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,839
much more reliable that you know we

1365
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,000
could shut all the other interfaces I

1366
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,299
don't know then it's going to be the PSC

1367
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:56,220
making that decision and using only the

1368
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,559
relevant Network so in that case the PSE

1369
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,020
is still useful even if we don't have

1370
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,319
that net end to end this is

1371
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,339
like I said the access uh use case and

1372
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,640
we we have it in our Prime statement and

1373
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,720
so

1374
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,180
for now we we still support it in that

1375
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,480
case we don't well we still see our

1376
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,359
design as in within that but it's not

1377
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,760
with that net end-to-end service and so

1378
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,140
we don't have latency currencies

1379
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,680
um now more subtle variations which are

1380
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,500
not Illustrated in the architecture and

1381
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,540
so I drew them

1382
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,760
um it's up to you guys to tell me if we

1383
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,280
want them in the document as well but

1384
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,440
for instance there is a case where and

1385
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,660
it relates to our transport discussion

1386
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,520
where

1387
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,020
there is some uni interface between the

1388
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,700
death net Edge node

1389
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,859
and the end system

1390
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:59,220
we don't have that net forwarding we

1391
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,460
might have TSN or it's just that the

1392
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,099
link layer provides enough warranties in

1393
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,500
terms of latency Etc between for

1394
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,900
instance is 10 gig and we have limited

1395
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,859
traffic

1396
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,380
so so we have good enough

1397
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,839
forwarding between the the end system

1398
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,480
and the first Hub that net uh Edge node

1399
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,579
and the traffic is basically on control

1400
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,040
just through the you and I and it's not

1401
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,440
uh basically what we currently have

1402
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,599
defined but the architect devnet

1403
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,819
architecture allows for Less so in the

1404
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:34,980
future we could Define the uni interface

1405
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,559
that is enough for the net Edge node to

1406
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,500
control the end system

1407
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,720
and so this this is a variation where we

1408
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,599
can still get guarantees

1409
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,119
uh across you know all the way to the

1410
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,220
end of whatever that net forwarding

1411
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,680
supports if there is an internet piece

1412
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,319
then there is no guarantee end to end if

1413
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,059
the internet on the right is just the

1414
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:00,000
access then we can still provide

1415
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,599
qualities

1416
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,980
uh so basically if that picture is

1417
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,440
symmetrical so so I don't know if it

1418
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,020
makes sense to to add this picture I'm

1419
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,180
willing to edit if if you tell me to do

1420
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,760
to do that it's it's a variation of the

1421
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,420
previous ones

1422
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:19,319
so there is also a new text of the

1423
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:20,819
dependencies

1424
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:23,460
so I highlighted what I think is the

1425
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,040
most important in the new text

1426
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,260
important is row is not uh the in in the

1427
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,480
forwarding sub layer so we don't provide

1428
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,180
or below so we don't provide warranties

1429
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,480
like latency it comes from a good

1430
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,819
interaction between the transport layer

1431
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:43,680
above us or the application whatever

1432
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,480
provides the packet

1433
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,319
and you know how the source of patriarch

1434
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,380
transport application respects the

1435
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,040
contract that we have with the dead net

1436
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,940
layers and basically that net forwarding

1437
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,940
and lower layers

1438
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,700
um which basically can consume that

1439
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,740
traffic you know when it's being passed

1440
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,420
and forward it forwarding it down the

1441
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,400
end-to-end across to that metronic plane

1442
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,440
so rho does not play a role in that

1443
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,440
okay

1444
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,360
[Music]

1445
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,579
I sure can

1446
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:43,200
yeah so uh just for understanding so I

1447
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,380
am somewhat confused with your term uni

1448
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,920
access we have here uni is uni and

1449
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,140
access is the link so the two two terms

1450
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,359
seem to go together but it's you and I

1451
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,220
over our Nexus link I just did not have

1452
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,339
enough space uh okay I I am also

1453
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,680
concerned about the uni because here we

1454
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,900
have end to end that net so also the end

1455
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,020
system they are speaking that net uh so

1456
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,780
why you are calling Edge node uh the

1457
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,299
debt not only serve is node it should be

1458
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,280
a relay node and then system is

1459
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,940
definitely no no no no I I oh let's take

1460
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,920
that offline and look at the death net

1461
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,500
architecture together to make sure we

1462
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,240
speak you know of the same things but

1463
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,740
that net basically has end-to-end

1464
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,000
service it has end systems and it has

1465
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,760
Ingress and degress Edge nodes which are

1466
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,099
not necessarily DN systems

1467
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,020
and so

1468
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:41,040
and and you know the uni is when

1469
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,640
the Ingress Edge is effectively not

1470
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,700
doing the edge system so for instance if

1471
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,220
the edge system is a PC and this PC is

1472
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,220
not capable of that net but the first

1473
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,339
switch is or the first router over the

1474
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:00,059
access the one Hub device is then the

1475
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:02,940
uni interface is basically how the PC

1476
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,760
will negotiate the creation of a bus for

1477
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,880
instance how the when the path is

1478
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
installed the PC will know and also

1479
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,520
whatever pacing method is done between

1480
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,520
that net and and the other PC so the PC

1481
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,460
provides the packets in due time

1482
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,059
so so all these things

1483
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:25,859
let's continue offline I think this is a

1484
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,619
longer discussion too yeah yeah it's a

1485
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,480
longer discussion it was envisioned in

1486
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,160
the in the death net architecture we

1487
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,319
have not worked on it but if you look at

1488
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,780
that net picture you will find us I mean

1489
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,420
this has been like from the Inception of

1490
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,380
of the working group

1491
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,058
or continue it at the end if that's okay

1492
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,940
so so so let's go so better since you're

1493
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,380
there right

1494
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,160
um so so I I just noted your three

1495
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,200
questions and what I answered on the

1496
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,819
main English I know it's a lot of text

1497
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:07,799
but it is because I just copied paste

1498
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:10,740
um that basically the question answer

1499
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,839
and I I answered on the mailing list as

1500
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:14,099
well so we could prepare for the

1501
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,299
discussion

1502
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:18,660
and this is very related to the point

1503
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,140
that Lou just made and So my answer to

1504
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,819
loose stance

1505
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:26,220
and I think that's that's I that's what

1506
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,200
I wanted to write down here

1507
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,539
and I would like to see if we are in

1508
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:33,920
sync or not in sick

1509
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:36,720
so did you have a chance to read my

1510
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,359
answer already or English or I mean

1511
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,000
maybe you can stay at the mic actually

1512
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,039
because it's short your three points

1513
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:46,020
coming in a row now

1514
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,780
yeah okay so I I already read your your

1515
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,339
answer

1516
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:53,880
um I do not fully agree with uh that but

1517
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,039
based on your presentation I think that

1518
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,980
you are not defining for example with a

1519
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,319
part of a data plane functionality but

1520
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:04,200
only a controller for those data plane

1521
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,020
functionalities so maybe that would work

1522
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,539
for some further discussion

1523
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:12,980
yeah we we can improve the text on Pio

1524
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,660
uh the first step would be to make sure

1525
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,240
that we are in sync on the intention and

1526
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,940
then we can review the text to make sure

1527
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,940
that it fits that intention

1528
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,240
I seem to I understood that Lou and I we

1529
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,720
have the same view and that view is what

1530
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,399
I try to write here

1531
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:39,000
and basically LS3 is always working on

1532
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,260
abstraction of Health too I mean that's

1533
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,059
what it is it is an abstraction of L2

1534
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:46,140
now because radios are very dynamic

1535
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,000
we need to have

1536
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,920
to add dynamic

1537
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,559
state or information or control in this

1538
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,960
abstraction and perio the difference

1539
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,539
between pario and pre-off is pretty much

1540
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:00,059
that we signal

1541
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:01,460
that

1542
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,680
those Dynamic things and that can be in

1543
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,900
one directional to triggers like receive

1544
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,720
signal strikes you know in quality TX

1545
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,059
uh in the other direction it could be

1546
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:15,420
please try to do as many retries please

1547
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,680
send it as a Mac layer multicast so

1548
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,720
there will be more than one node

1549
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,780
receiving it and that's basically what

1550
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,880
uh we we call the uh over Hearing in the

1551
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,400
O of Mario is basically controlling the

1552
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,680
fact that instead of sending unicast you

1553
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,380
send multicast and the receivers that

1554
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,059
expect the packet will be listening to

1555
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,500
the multicast pack

1556
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,440
so so from from my side most of the

1557
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,299
confusion is coming from the fact that

1558
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:47,400
you are stating in the document that uh

1559
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,299
pre-off is uh uh part of or better to

1560
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:54,359
say Parow is a a super set of pre-op and

1561
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:57,500
other functions but yeah

1562
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,839
I tend to think that what you intend to

1563
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:04,319
say is that Barrow is a Control Function

1564
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,940
this is controlling those

1565
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,180
functionalities and not replacing and uh

1566
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,819
and owning oh yeah I mean for the most

1567
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:13,200
dispario

1568
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,420
for the for the common letters I mean

1569
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,880
parallel is exactly pretty off there is

1570
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,920
just as more letters in it and some of

1571
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,839
those monitors is is a way to control

1572
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,839
our layers I I at least hint the lower

1573
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:25,920
layers

1574
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,500
but yes I mean the p is the same p as

1575
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,940
pre-off

1576
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,520
it seems the same thing exactly

1577
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,319
I'm just going to draw a line on that

1578
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,940
that conversation and say can you take

1579
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,200
that one to the list because I've got

1580
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,720
Janos in the queue I know Lou wanted a

1581
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,039
few comments and I'm watching the clock

1582
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,619
here good discussion please take that

1583
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,180
one to the list because I think it will

1584
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,259
need some careful

1585
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,839
I just wanted to edit one piece on this

1586
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,359
like what you said verbally I had the

1587
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,119
same confusion like and what you said

1588
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:02,339
verbally was more helpful for me than

1589
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:04,980
than the email list and everything uh

1590
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,140
I've been following I I really had a

1591
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,940
thorough review of the document I had to

1592
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,579
follow the emails and I I think the API

1593
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,180
is a key it is not there in the document

1594
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:17,819
and uh the two direction aspect of the

1595
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:20,819
API you just explained this key and and

1596
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:24,000
as for the the term parallel itself

1597
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,579
looks like layer violation on its own

1598
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:29,359
like combining combining the two like

1599
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,400
the The Arc or Heart Belongs to the

1600
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,920
lower layer yeah it's a control it's

1601
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,140
called itself and maybe it's not so good

1602
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,720
idea to come combine those no no it's

1603
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,400
not the agent we adjusted by the control

1604
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,299
yeah we also the the modeling of the of

1605
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,819
the lower layer or the radio layer which

1606
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:49,859
was the part of the comments in the

1607
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,319
email conversation I I think it's it's

1608
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,319
kind of crucial because the document

1609
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,500
says that rule is agnostic but actually

1610
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,220
that's not really how it plays out so so

1611
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,160
we have to be careful when we when we

1612
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,460
specify the API to really be agnostic

1613
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,380
and allow the different kind of murders

1614
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,740
the difference yes it is it is agnostic

1615
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,259
in that it abstracts right so you have

1616
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,658
to to expect abstracted features which

1617
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,899
may be may or may not be there uh it's

1618
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:23,698
not we don't know exactly if if a

1619
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:25,620
certain lower layer will do it but we

1620
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,000
can ask for it

1621
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,819
and okay no

1622
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,580
uh Lou Berger I'm glad I waited because

1623
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,040
I had two fundamental points and yanos

1624
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,600
just made the second one much more

1625
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,279
eloquently than I could you know the

1626
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,738
fundamental point is that the document

1627
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:43,620
reads as if all the elements described

1628
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,040
related to Paro are being done by raw as

1629
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,040
opposed to being controlled by raw and

1630
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,140
being done by a lower layer technology

1631
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,540
that's really not clear in the

1632
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,158
architecture and that's a that's a huge

1633
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,399
fundamental Point

1634
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,620
thanks that one is taken and it's

1635
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,120
certainly we lacked on it I hope the

1636
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,679
minutes reflected but

1637
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:06,299
it will be very difficult for me to

1638
01:09:06,299 --> 01:09:07,380
figure

1639
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,479
so I'm going to join the queue here so

1640
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,600
this is partially chair hat on and

1641
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,839
partially me personally I I think there

1642
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,000
is a way forwards here what I'm what I'm

1643
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,679
sensing from the discussion at the

1644
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,060
moment is

1645
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,620
the sentiments are great but lack a

1646
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,979
certain level of clarity where you know

1647
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:30,600
Carlos is saying some really good

1648
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,000
diagrams would help draw out the

1649
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
discussion uh I'm hearing people saying

1650
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,880
Pascal you're being very clear when

1651
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,679
you're answering the questions but

1652
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,600
somehow that Clarity is missing from the

1653
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,319
document so I'm I'm

1654
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,540
I don't have a good proposal on how to

1655
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,238
get that Clarity but I think there needs

1656
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:53,279
to be more work on this document and I'm

1657
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,040
kind of looking at the people such as

1658
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,280
yanish and Carlos and and Lou to to to

1659
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,460
drive a little bit to assist Pascal who

1660
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,719
you know what it's like when you write

1661
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:04,860
your own document you understand

1662
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,960
implicitly what you've put down because

1663
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,260
you wrote it but as an outsider digging

1664
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,179
through other people's language can be a

1665
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:13,920
little harder so I think some of the

1666
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,420
work here has to be done by the

1667
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,239
commenters to say actually I have I have

1668
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,060
redrawn or I have drawn a diagram based

1669
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,520
on my understanding of your text is this

1670
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,920
correct and that can then become which

1671
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,920
is a bit what better says

1672
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,719
or whatever so

1673
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,940
yeah that's very useful

1674
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,380
yep

1675
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,400
okay

1676
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,860
so uh Pascal we have about five more

1677
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,420
minutes before we eat into everybody

1678
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,659
else's presentation in time so so we

1679
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:45,000
need to move on so

1680
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,040
modeling of radio components I think

1681
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,760
we've discussed that I was not sure what

1682
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,920
you meant by it's not the way the lower

1683
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,560
your do it if if you meant the 5G

1684
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,780
networks which appears as a virtual

1685
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,880
switch in that case completely back to

1686
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,560
us

1687
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,780
um now my suggestion was

1688
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,580
to improve the discussion on the

1689
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,260
interaction with the lower layers which

1690
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,179
is exactly what we have been discussing

1691
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:11,940
here we have a dependency section we

1692
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,920
could also describe you know that

1693
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,199
dependency the apis or something and the

1694
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:20,520
fact that tario controls the arq and the

1695
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,520
uh over nearing functions but does not

1696
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,120
do them just like death net expects the

1697
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,640
the lower layer uh

1698
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,040
Shapers or something but that does not

1699
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,080
do them

1700
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,440
um just a very fast feedback so it is

1701
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,719
not a virtual switch is it is a router

1702
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,120
in in late and written discussion but I

1703
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,159
will comment it on on the on the list

1704
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,620
okay okay

1705
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,840
so I thought you were doing TSN only but

1706
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,239
okay

1707
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:55,879
um so related to q1

1708
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,580
so so you seem to be seeing in a

1709
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,640
position with the non-row sub Network

1710
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,159
can be neglected so I don't know how to

1711
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,900
work this and then again I can use some

1712
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,020
help but this was referring to

1713
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,600
to this picture

1714
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,739
early on where you know a set of the

1715
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:22,199
network is not controlled by that net

1716
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,060
the piece that we cannot call the

1717
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,360
internet and the way we we operate in

1718
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,820
that case is we measure the end to end

1719
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:34,679
oam basically and whatever happens you

1720
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:37,020
know whatever price we have to pay is

1721
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,060
built on the first half of the access so

1722
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,040
basically we do as if the access was

1723
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,560
responsible for all the latency was

1724
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,480
responsible for All Digital was

1725
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,760
responsible for all the Hops all the

1726
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,460
laws even though they are only observed

1727
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,739
and to end and it could be buffer upload

1728
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,920
in the internet it could be

1729
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,900
congestion loss in the internet Etc but

1730
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,640
since we don't have that net end-to-end

1731
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,040
to guarantee that the service will be

1732
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,800
fair will be correct all the way down we

1733
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,080
can only say we need to select an access

1734
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,659
interface let's select the access

1735
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,580
interface that provides the best and to

1736
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,600
end result so that's what we had in mind

1737
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,840
in in that the known rows of network can

1738
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,020
be neglected in the computation

1739
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,060
we can write it some other way but that

1740
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,780
was the intention

1741
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,699
so what is the the confusion or maybe we

1742
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,860
can continue on the email because we are

1743
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,500
late but basically

1744
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,900
yeah I'm happy to clarify I just don't

1745
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,219
exactly understand what I should be

1746
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,739
doing

1747
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:46,080
so loose cabels and that's the slides I

1748
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,820
I had sent an update but that was

1749
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,140
missing once I will send you another

1750
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,500
update or right after after the meeting

1751
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,239
so you can you know push the latest

1752
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,659
slide on the repo but so one of those

1753
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:00,120
points was the term row and we already

1754
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,100
discussed that that didn't train last

1755
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,120
time

1756
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,880
and basically what is role they aren't

1757
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,460
another way of doing this is of asking

1758
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:13,440
this is is the ISRO the UDA Loop or will

1759
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,780
there be more because today the

1760
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,699
architecture is the udal right it

1761
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:20,280
describes the UDA Loop and provides more

1762
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,020
information about the PSC because it

1763
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,760
does not exist but we also provide

1764
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,159
information about parallel Etc because

1765
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,100
we are defining the whole including OEM

1766
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,880
etc for observe and

1767
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,360
question is is this UDA Loop wrote

1768
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,780
everything everything about row and only

1769
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:40,800
row

1770
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,860
or is this uh

1771
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:49,040
I'm sorry

1772
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,840
sorry I was called twice I had to tell

1773
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,980
the guy that

1774
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:01,140
will go back so so

1775
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,520
um

1776
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,699
so basically for me if we if raw does

1777
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:08,100
not reach out to our River row is the

1778
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,199
UDA and rho is basically what we have in

1779
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,900
this document uh on the other hand if

1780
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,199
some people consider that row will reach

1781
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:17,760
out to work on other stuff which are

1782
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,560
related to wireless and make it more

1783
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,960
reliable available some other ways then

1784
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,880
maybe the name of this document is not

1785
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,340
correct it's not the raw architecture is

1786
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,040
the raw UDA architecture or something

1787
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,159
so that's basically my answer to Lou and

1788
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,020
taking hints there

1789
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,560
whatever you guys suggested

1790
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,540
I'm gonna I'm gonna jump in the queue

1791
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,699
myself now and then Luke and have a go

1792
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:44,219
um this is Rick here yeah

1793
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,400
I I understand the reference to udon

1794
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,420
this is actually going back to a common

1795
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,300
cast and made uh in the chat here yes

1796
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,820
UDA is a great fundamental uh but I

1797
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,260
think we're all fairly familiar with the

1798
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,300
fact that this is a control Loop uh we

1799
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,120
are making a decision receiving feedback

1800
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,040
on what is occurring as a result of that

1801
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,140
vision and updating that decision and in

1802
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,000
a wireless Dynamic Network

1803
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,820
that is required some could say that in

1804
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,820
a in a fixed uh fixed wire net

1805
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,560
environment that complete Loop is not

1806
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,239
needed you can make a plan and push it

1807
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:17,159
down Lou is shaking his head saying

1808
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:18,900
actually you do need that Loop anyway

1809
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,239
yeah it could be useful we that's one of

1810
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:22,380
the first question as well why

1811
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,120
restricted we are abstract with layer

1812
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,679
three we should not restrict anything

1813
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,360
that's my answer to Lou and that

1814
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,760
particular question but it's certainly

1815
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,679
did usually in Wireless States is on

1816
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,000
wire but

1817
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,340
should not be restricted

1818
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,340
I don't think we need to spend a lot of

1819
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,440
time talking about Buddha and I don't

1820
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,159
think UDA makes defines Raw

1821
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,000
it's raw is about

1822
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,060
making the extending that net to work

1823
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,800
with wireless and that requires a

1824
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,179
feedback loop

1825
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:56,820
yeah so should this document this

1826
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,340
document is limited right now to UDA we

1827
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,380
that's the only thing it discusses so

1828
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,880
maybe in the future we'll be doing more

1829
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,679
stuff in this case

1830
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:07,440
but most of how will we call it because

1831
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,840
this architecture document is limited to

1832
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,719
the UDA so my question is if row is more

1833
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,460
than the UDA then this document is

1834
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,260
probably not the raw architecture it's

1835
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,860
the raw UDA architecture so just with a

1836
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,080
piece of whatever row is

1837
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,920
you see my point

1838
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,760
for me I think uh so yeah I've stepped

1839
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,380
out of the out of the line and let loose

1840
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,690
because I'm watching the clock

1841
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,340
[Music]

1842
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,620
so uh I now ought to react to the

1843
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,480
conversation that just happened

1844
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,719
um the slewburger

1845
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,679
UDA is uh you know a a a philosophical

1846
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:48,840
definition or it's a high level

1847
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,780
definition of reacting and yeah

1848
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,520
all of our control protocols fall into

1849
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,000
the loop so you know saying

1850
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,640
ooda Loop is novel here you know I don't

1851
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,040
get it

1852
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,239
we're just saying that's that's what we

1853
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:09,300
Define we Define a UDA Loop I think

1854
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,040
every control almost every control plane

1855
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,100
protocol that we have in the ITF follows

1856
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,739
a doodle Loop so you know it doesn't to

1857
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:18,840
me it doesn't add a whole lot to to use

1858
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,400
the term UDA but it doesn't also and

1859
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,500
it's like okay sure I accept it but I

1860
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,520
don't think it's something fundamental

1861
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,080
to Raw I don't think it's fundamental to

1862
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,420
the document I don't think it frankly I

1863
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,860
don't think it adds a lot but I also

1864
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,020
don't think it hurts so

1865
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,360
um you know I I but if you're saying

1866
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,699
this is only the the raw UDA

1867
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:37,080
architecture I don't understand the

1868
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,280
difference between the raw architecture

1869
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,800
and the raw UDA architecture but you

1870
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,659
know it's a philosophical thing I I I

1871
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,699
don't know because right now that's the

1872
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:46,920
only thing we've discussed and is there

1873
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,719
something else completely different that

1874
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,820
Leo 3.net could be doing for a wireless

1875
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,580
which is not this control look I don't

1876
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,360
know

1877
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,760
so so rather than rather than go to the

1878
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,400
philosophy and rather than like talk a

1879
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,320
lot about it I think we should be

1880
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,600
focused on what the text actually says

1881
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,880
and the updates that we need to the text

1882
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,699
because when we have these discussions I

1883
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:11,900
think we are largely in agreement about

1884
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,340
high-level Concepts like the whole

1885
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,040
discussion about the layering but it's

1886
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,719
the the thing that's lacking is the

1887
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,040
translation of the discussion into the

1888
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,679
text so rather than you know talking

1889
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,060
more about the high level and worrying

1890
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,620
about that I think we really should be

1891
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,880
worried about the sections of the text

1892
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,580
that are problematic yeah we need to do

1893
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,739
that on the email but completely agree

1894
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:35,820
I'm fine with that yes please help

1895
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,179
enough just an additional comment on on

1896
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:42,840
what is role and I could not articulate

1897
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,640
this before your presentation helped and

1898
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,860
the figures like showing road service

1899
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,679
and that not service and I'm not sure

1900
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,440
that we are making us uh service to the

1901
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,280
industry by distinguishing this too like

1902
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,920
uh even even the text on this on the on

1903
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,540
the side copied from from the

1904
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,000
architecture was like my view was that

1905
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,480
for layer 3 like IP that is end-to-end

1906
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,120
one service like a connectivity which we

1907
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,920
used to call that net service and I

1908
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,900
thought that what we are doing in a row

1909
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,320
group is is defining uh the wireless

1910
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,780
segment the wireless subnet segment on

1911
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,080
how to achieve this end-to-end

1912
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,040
deterministic service

1913
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,040
and if you now like we introduce the

1914
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,960
third one like we have TSN service for

1915
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,679
the DSN subnet for layer 2 and we have

1916
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,659
the dotnet service as defined by the net

1917
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,940
networking group if we keep adding on

1918
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:38,219
which is essentially the same just over

1919
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:40,980
Wireless we are not creating a death net

1920
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,940
service right we we have detnet

1921
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,380
functionality inside I'm sorry we have

1922
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,280
row

1923
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,500
functionality inside the dotnet service

1924
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,020
and I hope that there will be a that net

1925
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,060
control sub layer so I can change this

1926
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,520
picture to say that the PSE is part of

1927
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,219
the death net control sub layer which is

1928
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:02,340
I hope what we'll be defining soon right

1929
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,840
now since it's not there in the

1930
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,000
architecture I had to write raw control

1931
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,620
surveyor because there is not such a

1932
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,420
thing in the net architecture but

1933
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,159
otherwise what this picture wanted to

1934
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,219
make clear is that whatever

1935
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:16,040
we do is

1936
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,659
components that fit inside the bigger

1937
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:20,639
set that is called that net service and

1938
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,340
that net forwarding but it's not a new

1939
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,159
service so so it might be this picture

1940
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,860
actually which is distressful well let

1941
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:32,299
me go back to the next slide

1942
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,820
I like what you say verbally and somehow

1943
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,040
we need to update the pictures figures

1944
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,860
and the text if that's this picture the

1945
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,420
Rope last you know I didn't have much

1946
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,719
space to write but it's row inside

1947
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:48,179
you know that net service with raw stuff

1948
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:50,420
inside

1949
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,580
I'm going to conclude this now because

1950
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,320
we're running out of time but this is

1951
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,300
useful very useful and we need to take

1952
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,739
it to the mailing list I'm going to make

1953
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:02,100
one last comment about is raw UDA or is

1954
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,199
raw bigger than UDA and I'm gonna do

1955
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:06,300
that in reference to the Charter we have

1956
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,400
been chartered for 12 to 18 months and

1957
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,620
we've already taken two and a half years

1958
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:14,820
I would suggest that the ooda loop and

1959
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,100
that traditional reactive control plane

1960
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,340
uh feedback loop is what we were

1961
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,520
chartered to work on as raw if there is

1962
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,739
some exciting new way of doing it using

1963
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:28,020
machine learning and and predictive

1964
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,420
modeling or whatever that would be

1965
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,860
another working group it would

1966
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,920
definitely be a retartering so I'm

1967
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,540
looking at my A.D to tell me I'm wrong

1968
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,219
and I'm looking at my co-chair to tell

1969
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,980
me I'm wrong but I think we do Huda

1970
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,440
that's enough for us now and I don't so

1971
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,239
let's go let's keep what we have then we

1972
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,739
are writing the raw architecture and

1973
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:48,600
there is no need to change anything no

1974
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,699
title or anything that's what it was

1975
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:54,120
asking that discussion for now and let's

1976
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,679
have a Barb off about whether we want to

1977
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,260
do something else but okay so is it the

1978
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,900
end of my time and so we skip what I

1979
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,860
have

1980
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,380
Pascal thank you thank you very much

1981
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,420
let's take all these good conversations

1982
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,980
to the list we will continue to have

1983
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,780
virtual enter in so that we can continue

1984
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,360
to have this decision so I keep the

1985
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,520
slides for the next entry and I really

1986
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,380
thank you for all this discussion I'm

1987
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,600
looking forward you know for helping

1988
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,580
getting things written the right way

1989
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,100
so at least we we seem to be in sync on

1990
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,780
the intention and that's great I mean we

1991
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,280
are not that far that means we are not

1992
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,139
that far

1993
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,300
so Eve I've lost track of the agenda

1994
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,880
because I lost my DNS for some reason so

1995
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,500
uh my loss next isn't it yes it's Carlos

1996
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,420
and I guess Carlos um if you wouldn't

1997
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,520
mind

1998
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,800
we are needing maybe we've assigned um

1999
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,420
you have two talks for 14 years

2000
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,639
Jerome for 15 minutes yeah okay and then

2001
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:56,040
Carlos follows with two talks that maybe

2002
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,320
we can press down by a couple of minutes

2003
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,860
okay

2004
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,980
Jerome I'm gonna share your slides and

2005
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,260
pass you control

2006
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,520
so

2007
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,960
if you've not done it before if you

2008
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,219
hover your mouse at the bottom of the

2009
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:12,960
screen a little semi-transparent bar

2010
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,639
pops up and you can you can step through

2011
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,739
your own slides if that's okay otherwise

2012
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:20,299
go ahead sorry for the delay

2013
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,520
foreign

2014
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:35,699
hello hello Jerome can you hear me

2015
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:40,460
we don't hear you Jerome

2016
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,420
still can't hear you

2017
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,980
uh

2018
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,280
I shall I shall unshare his slides and

2019
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,739
see if he notices

2020
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:59,718
um Jerome you can't be hearing us

2021
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,820
Jerome do you want to do an audio check

2022
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,980
just check your audio is working

2023
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,100
oh it appears to be at my end it might

2024
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,699
be the problem but no no it's also um on

2025
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:20,120
the internet

2026
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,679
perhaps if you stop doing video let's

2027
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:31,080
try that as well

2028
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,600
or do I have to give him permission to

2029
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,219
speak

2030
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,820
no no he's open mic

2031
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,639
everybody can speak

2032
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:44,940
I think it's a local problem yeah

2033
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:50,219
um no can we have assistance please

2034
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:52,380
are you hearing me speak

2035
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,000
yes oh okay so it's not a local problem

2036
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,900
um

2037
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,960
and of course Carson is also remote

2038
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,880
so perhaps it is Jerome's

2039
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,040
can you share something on the screen

2040
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,540
saying that we can't hear you Jerome

2041
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,820
like if

2042
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,860
he can't hear us can he

2043
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:17,520
I think that may be the problem as well

2044
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,860
Jerome are you using the right set of

2045
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:22,320
headphones

2046
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,239
I do that regularly

2047
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,500
mixing up my headphones

2048
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,380
thank you

2049
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,440
should we just lose your room altogether

2050
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,060
yeah I think he's just yeah maybe he's

2051
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,580
coming back in maybe what we do since we

2052
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,360
are

2053
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,280
um pressed for time

2054
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,280
Carlos

2055
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:11,179
and we will come back to Jerome okay

2056
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,600
uh I'm trying a different browser sorry

2057
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,500
I apologize

2058
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:21,300
we'll we'll jump back to you sorry

2059
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,960
Carlos Bieber I'm very sorry I I um I

2060
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,280
thought everything was working until I

2061
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,460
tried

2062
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,780
it does not matter it is always the way

2063
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,840
these happen okay I'll uh you've got

2064
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,639
I'll go two minutes shorter to take up

2065
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:36,960
for the for the time thank you very much

2066
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,600
for the opportunity so so there's a lot

2067
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,760
of things going on in 2018 that may be

2068
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,739
of interest to us

2069
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:46,020
um a quick reminder first on on how

2070
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,280
things are articulated over there you

2071
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,080
know there is the main eight to the 11

2072
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,020
working group at the IEEE

2073
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,520
um which has Amendment which are

2074
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,980
developed every you know often

2075
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,960
um each of them has a letter sequence

2076
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,880
we've done all the A's already and all

2077
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,280
the alphabets so we are in the ebf b e j

2078
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,199
Etc and then on the other side there is

2079
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,000
the Wi-Fi Alliance which has um

2080
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,320
certification programs there are a group

2081
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,179
of companies that go together select

2082
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:12,480
subsets of what the AI Tripoli does and

2083
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,520
create programs uh that people certify

2084
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,139
against so all companies have a backward

2085
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:18,540
compatibility with each other

2086
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,520
um the programs that are typically

2087
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,260
making a lot of noise are those that

2088
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,120
improve performances

2089
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,159
um and those their name Wi-Fi plus

2090
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,199
something we are a generation seven so

2091
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:30,000
you may have heard of a Wi-Fi six that's

2092
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,800
probably what you have at home

2093
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,560
um which is um a set of a certification

2094
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,060
that implement the standard which is

2095
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:39,420
802.11 ax so in the iqbee right now we

2096
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,820
are in the Next Generation which is 8 to

2097
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,699
11 b e uh this amendment will have still

2098
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,739
a few years to go it's a slated to

2099
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:49,199
finish by 2024 you know beginning of

2100
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,760
2024

2101
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,500
um which you know seems long but you

2102
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:55,440
know we're discussing of scale uh we

2103
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,000
have about the same scale structure the

2104
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,880
IEEE where most of the work is down now

2105
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,380
they have to make sure they tighten all

2106
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,060
the nuts and all the bolts

2107
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,159
um and that takes typically a year and a

2108
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:07,560
half so it's pretty uh crystallized

2109
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,480
what's going to be in be and the Wi-Fi

2110
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,980
lens I started a group called Wi-Fi

2111
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,120
seven

2112
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,219
um that is going to certify several

2113
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:15,900
elements of it the reason why I

2114
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,020
mentioned this is because in 11b

2115
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,699
there is a new feature which is called

2116
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:23,460
mlo which is multi-league Operation by

2117
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,780
which you see the illustration at the

2118
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:26,520
bottom a device typically your station

2119
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,480
can create two links two connections to

2120
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,000
an access point and have a single

2121
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,980
identity over these two links which

2122
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,679
allows of course a better reliability

2123
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:41,219
the initial days of mlo were creating

2124
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:43,500
the intention of allowing this mechanism

2125
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,960
across multiple access points but they

2126
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,820
realize that that implied a lot of

2127
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,500
coordination requirements between access

2128
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,360
points and there was a lot of complexity

2129
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,040
and they realized they would not have

2130
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,040
time within the time imparted to be to

2131
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,320
finish that so they Park that

2132
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,260
um so in even the mlo functions against

2133
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,900
one single access point two radios for

2134
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,600
example five gigahertz and 2.4 or 6

2135
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,880
gigahertz so you know that increase the

2136
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,520
reliability of operations on one side

2137
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,980
there are plenty of other things in be

2138
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:17,179
and previous generations are very

2139
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:19,520
targeted toward better reliable ability

2140
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,560
among other things in be there is what

2141
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,719
they call a plink of dma which

2142
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,520
essentially allows an access point to

2143
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,800
schedule a plane traffic from multiple

2144
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,380
stations at the same time and you know

2145
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,300
allocating some slots for these these

2146
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,280
sessions this can be part of a

2147
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,020
negotiation between the station and the

2148
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:39,000
access point which makes the process you

2149
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,920
know very reliable in terms of providing

2150
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,080
the stations then with at the time it

2151
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,300
needs for the need

2152
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,400
um the uh the the mechanism is still you

2153
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,900
know congestion based so it's not you

2154
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,060
know purely controlled but it's it's

2155
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,920
much better than what we had before

2156
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,139
so b as I've done a lot of good things

2157
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:57,780
but things are are left to be solved uh

2158
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,280
in particular

2159
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,800
um this mlo structure against multiple

2160
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,420
access phones is something that was left

2161
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,120
for what I'm going to call 8-11

2162
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,460
generation eight uh so that's going to

2163
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,239
be eight to the 11 B something z x y

2164
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,520
depending on where they land uh where

2165
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,679
this group is formed but that's the Next

2166
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:18,900
Generation after be that we'll have to

2167
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,639
address this uh coordination between

2168
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:23,460
access points uh for analog and that's

2169
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,199
of course very important for us because

2170
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,300
if you have a device that moves uh you

2171
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,860
want not only to have better reliability

2172
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,380
into one access point but also make

2173
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,120
before break so create a connection to

2174
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,500
the next AP

2175
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,880
um so you already have a connection As

2176
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,260
you move from one access phone to the

2177
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,360
other in short you have zero delay in

2178
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,100
the roaming and zero loss so that's the

2179
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,060
goal

2180
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,699
in parallel three things are happening

2181
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,139
that may be of interest for this group

2182
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:49,080
uh one of them is that they realize that

2183
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,060
many iot devices start connecting to

2184
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,100
Wi-Fi and several of them are battery

2185
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,600
operated

2186
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,580
um and uh the ID is to maintain the

2187
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,219
battery as long as we can so there is a

2188
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:02,100
new group that was formed in July last

2189
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,500
this month a couple of weeks ago that is

2190
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,380
called amp ambient power and the goal is

2191
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,840
to be able to harvest energy from the

2192
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,300
environment uh to do two things one is

2193
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,219
recharge a battery if you have operated

2194
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:18,780
battery device but also use this Ambient

2195
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,000
Energy to reflect back energy to a

2196
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,280
system which is somehow very similar to

2197
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,500
what you have in stores with this entire

2198
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,840
theft system where there's sort of cord

2199
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,000
that radiates back energy from from the

2200
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,460
gate and that allows you know the system

2201
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,260
to detect that something is being taken

2202
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,360
out of the store this is important for

2203
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,739
us because of course

2204
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:39,480
um harvesting energy from the

2205
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,980
environment is good

2206
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,780
um introducing systems on the same

2207
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,520
frequency that are going to be radiating

2208
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,280
back energy for other purposes might

2209
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,860
create some difficulties in coexistent

2210
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,480
with Wi-Fi devices so everybody's

2211
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,580
keeping a very close eye on what exactly

2212
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,580
is amp group is going to be doing you

2213
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,500
know just harvesting energy or also

2214
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,620
introducing noise so to speak in the

2215
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,000
Wi-Fi world

2216
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,340
another one is um something which is

2217
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,860
probably derived from the 6G initiative

2218
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:10,280
where machine learning is being

2219
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,420
introduced as being a very important

2220
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,060
component so here as well there is the

2221
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,340
ID that optimization and reliability in

2222
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,620
Wi-Fi is only going to happen if there

2223
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,179
is you know smartness in the

2224
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:22,860
coordination between the access phones

2225
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,900
and the stations so in July as well

2226
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,280
another group has formed which is called

2227
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,340
AIML which is essentially artificial

2228
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,600
intelligence and machine learning for

2229
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,820
Wi-Fi and the goal here is to examine

2230
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:35,940
how you know each side can use machine

2231
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:37,980
learning tools to improve the conditions

2232
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,920
of the the uh of the cell so that in you

2233
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,320
know it implies reliability for us but

2234
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,480
also exchange between the clients and

2235
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,880
the access points on machine learning

2236
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,739
things and here we think of you know

2237
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:51,600
metrics and statistics so that one side

2238
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,780
can do better computation or exchanging

2239
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,780
provisions and predictions and models

2240
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,940
so that's uh two groups that are very

2241
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,440
interesting another one which I think is

2242
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,199
useful for this one for this group here

2243
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,480
um is not created yet it's a group that

2244
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,159
is likely to be created because it was

2245
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:09,780
approved each question was approved in

2246
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,920
July

2247
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,780
um and that's what is called ultra high

2248
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:16,139
reliability study group so in the Wi-Fi

2249
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:17,880
nomenclature we have 80 to 11

2250
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,400
nomenclature we have typically first a

2251
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,100
topic interesting group TIG where people

2252
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,900
discuss whether a topic is of interest

2253
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,940
to enough people that we want to dig

2254
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:29,820
further if the conclusion is yes then we

2255
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,440
create a study group that studies

2256
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,940
exactly what could be done there in

2257
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:36,239
82.11. that typically lasts for about a

2258
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:39,179
year and at the end of the SG a task

2259
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,639
group is created to actually do work so

2260
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,860
here you know improving on on Wi-Fi

2261
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,540
condition is so obvious that they didn't

2262
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,400
have the need to create a TIG they

2263
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,800
created directly a studio group uh well

2264
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,060
that's going again to be created in

2265
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,340
September it was approved in July and

2266
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,739
you see the list of target areas here so

2267
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:57,840
this uh mlo between access point is

2268
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,780
likely to be taken by these groups as

2269
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,699
well but you see on the list they are

2270
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:04,440
going to work on many items which are

2271
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,080
going to be of interest to us so you

2272
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,000
know if anybody here is interested in

2273
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,500
those topics please you know reach out

2274
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,900
to the IEEE you know it's a like the ITF

2275
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:15,199
it's the individual uh driven

2276
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,520
organization we also have Liaisons and

2277
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,440
all these things so that we can continue

2278
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,480
exchanging and see if there's anything

2279
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,520
in 8.11 that this group in particular

2280
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,520
can do that could be of interest to Rob

2281
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,460
for your reference I added a few links

2282
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,619
to IEEE as you know all the documents

2283
01:35:31,619 --> 01:35:33,659
are publicly available so those are a

2284
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:34,860
few documents that may be of interest

2285
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:37,440
for our conversation let me pause there

2286
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,480
so I don't take any much more time I'm

2287
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,860
very happy to answer questions if there

2288
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:44,580
are any or pass the ball to Carlos

2289
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,860
thank you very much Jerome uh there's no

2290
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,239
one actively in the queue at the moment

2291
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,940
uh just in for time purposes can you

2292
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,440
take your questions to the list for

2293
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,540
Jerome absolutely thank you very much

2294
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,060
everyone really useful material thank

2295
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:57,840
you

2296
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,860
go ahead call us

2297
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,060
okay

2298
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:08,219
um from this video I think for the use

2299
01:36:08,219 --> 01:36:10,320
cases we can even skip the slides

2300
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,659
because the summary is very short we

2301
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:14,880
didn't do any updates since last ITF

2302
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,860
because we were in the Publications

2303
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,900
process and well we discussed before

2304
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:21,900
that it would be so basically just to

2305
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,219
report that the outsources are ready to

2306
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:26,040
to to tackle any comment that results

2307
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,699
from from that the IGA evaluation on the

2308
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:32,639
on the sepharden process so we can jump

2309
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:33,960
to the

2310
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:36,179
to the next one and then we we save some

2311
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:40,800
time so quick nudge to our ad uh that

2312
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,420
document's been waiting in the isg

2313
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:45,239
review queue for a couple of months now

2314
01:36:45,239 --> 01:36:48,420
let me just yep so uh this is part of my

2315
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,580
Mia culpa email that I sent out to at

2316
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:53,100
least my chairs earlier this week which

2317
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,420
is yes

2318
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:56,159
um I'm behind on my queue and I am

2319
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,719
working to

2320
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:59,580
move things along faster

2321
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,320
thank you for your efforts I'm trying to

2322
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,719
match them thanks

2323
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:06,780
and then the Royal multi-domain that's a

2324
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,520
work that is

2325
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,360
ongoing and that we will have also a

2326
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,639
kind of uh separate more high level

2327
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:17,280
discussion in dead net tomorrow so next

2328
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,980
slide please so we are here that uh in

2329
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,360
the working group we have been mostly

2330
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,040
focusing on

2331
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,860
a single domain at least uh we didn't

2332
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:28,679
touch specifically multiple main aspects

2333
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:30,540
although this discussion that we have

2334
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,760
with Pascal before about the raw and

2335
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,920
dead net to me that's part of the

2336
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,719
multi-domain aspects that we need to

2337
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,219
tackle because Technologies may be

2338
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,960
considered different domains

2339
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,719
so we justify or we motivate in the

2340
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:43,619
document that there are different

2341
01:37:43,619 --> 01:37:45,480
scenarios in raw

2342
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,199
that require of multiple domains again

2343
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,239
meaning domain something that is a

2344
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:53,280
technology or an administrative domain

2345
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,500
or both things you may have we may have

2346
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,380
different Technologies animation domains

2347
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,139
and they react this draft is to motivate

2348
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:04,219
and this will already

2349
01:38:04,219 --> 01:38:07,619
fulfill that purpose the discussion on

2350
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:10,199
what are the potential gaps if any that

2351
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:12,060
needs to be tackled for multi-domain

2352
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,520
maybe the the conclusion is that

2353
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,100
everything is important fine

2354
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,020
in terms of architecture Orient

2355
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,900
mechanisms control plane mechanisms and

2356
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,520
if something is needed maybe explore

2357
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,199
potential solution in this particular

2358
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,440
document there is a kind of solution

2359
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,360
sketch but the main goal is to motivate

2360
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,040
a discussion on the gaps not to actually

2361
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,260
discard the solution yet next slide

2362
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,179
please

2363
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,520
so this is an exemplary scenario we have

2364
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,159
two different domains in the slide it

2365
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:45,060
switched its own pce and there are kind

2366
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,699
of multiple potential gaps that we need

2367
01:38:47,699 --> 01:38:49,500
to Target on the one hand we need these

2368
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,840
two domains to discover and set up an

2369
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,679
interconnection that may be done with a

2370
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,420
different solution or maybe already in

2371
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,159
place and even with that connectivity in

2372
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:01,980
place we will need to for example have

2373
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:04,380
inter-pca work there are documents in

2374
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,260
ATF for inter-pce so the idea is to

2375
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,780
check if what is there is sufficient or

2376
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:12,119
not for rotted net purposes

2377
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:14,580
and then check if we need to have some

2378
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:19,260
inter domain PSE coordination or API to

2379
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,880
support this scenario again this is

2380
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,880
ongoing discussion the document is

2381
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,440
proposing a solution in the next slide

2382
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,780
uh that we I will not go into the

2383
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:30,719
details because this is just as uh let's

2384
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,060
go to the next one I'm sorry

2385
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,280
a potential solution

2386
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,440
but again the idea here is to discuss on

2387
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,300
on the cards so we can go to the next

2388
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,440
one

2389
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,020
which is the last if I'm not wrong

2390
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,719
so yes is there any interest in looking

2391
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:47,639
into this again looking into whether

2392
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,100
this is a problem or not if this is a

2393
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,840
problem then we can discuss whether

2394
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,520
there are solutions that can be done in

2395
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,679
ATF and in which working group

2396
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,320
this related and an actual internet we

2397
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,000
have a companion document looking more

2398
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,800
at the high level and the net level

2399
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,260
trying to explore the gaps

2400
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,300
and I also benefit from the opportunity

2401
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,820
that to to mention that we are going to

2402
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,219
have a new project funded that is very

2403
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,260
much stacked into these points and also

2404
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,659
into what their own presented about the

2405
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:18,719
use of AI to predict in a dead net raw

2406
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,980
environment so maybe that we can uh

2407
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,500
uh bring more content really to that

2408
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,780
into that net and raw

2409
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,880
and what the the idea is to get feedback

2410
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,560
do you think guys that this is a

2411
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,480
relevant problem to to work we will have

2412
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,880
discussion tomorrow on that net as well

2413
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:39,119
and if so please join us uh to to

2414
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,520
continue working on the documents

2415
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,800
thank you Carlos uh personally I think

2416
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,540
this is really important work I think

2417
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,219
you can't just have a single domain

2418
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:48,420
solution and expect it to work

2419
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,179
everywhere I with my chair hat on would

2420
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:53,040
like to be led by work happening in

2421
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,380
debtnet and build on it to make it work

2422
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,060
in a raw environment I think that's the

2423
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,619
best way to work on it and I'm looking

2424
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:00,600
at Lou at the mic let's keep it snappy

2425
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,520
but yeah yeah I'm going to agree with I

2426
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,260
agree with everything you just said

2427
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:05,880
um I think if we clean up the

2428
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,040
architecture it'll actually help because

2429
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,860
but for example the enter PSC we already

2430
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,900
have cross domain protection mechanisms

2431
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,360
in the larger te body of work that we

2432
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,380
can just Leverage

2433
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,199
perfect thank you very much Carlos uh

2434
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,179
Bob thank you for being patient

2435
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:23,219
um you almost have your full time so

2436
01:41:23,219 --> 01:41:24,600
well done everyone else we're going

2437
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,960
quick

2438
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,540
[Music]

2439
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:30,020
gotta bring this down to my height here

2440
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:34,760
okay get my slides going here thank you

2441
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:40,380
thank you okay please proceed

2442
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,780
why am I here why am I doing this

2443
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,340
because bad things happen to IP

2444
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,380
datagrams in the internet they tend to

2445
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:49,080
get lost in trash red is real I was in

2446
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,719
the meeting room when red was designed

2447
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:53,639
um it is called best effort for for a

2448
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:56,580
reason I've worked in Ada 211 802 15.

2449
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,159
Wireless links are amazing that they

2450
01:41:59,159 --> 01:42:01,619
work as well as they do but there are

2451
01:42:01,619 --> 01:42:03,179
times when the mail must go through

2452
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:05,040
segue here to a picture of a mailman

2453
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:08,659
going through blinding um snowstorm

2454
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,580
um don't expect internet to fix your

2455
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:14,780
problems yes

2456
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:18,360
don't don't expect the internet to fix

2457
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:21,239
your problems it works well for

2458
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:23,580
everything else so why worry amazing

2459
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:26,179
things can be done over Wireless links

2460
01:42:26,179 --> 01:42:29,600
what are you willing and able to pay

2461
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:33,179
fast reliable cheap choose two or maybe

2462
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:35,780
only one

2463
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,540
and if it's smart or dumb internet we

2464
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,460
can do better smart things with a dumb

2465
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,380
internet it's cheaper for the internet

2466
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:45,780
if we don't put this internet as pricer

2467
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,179
at the endpoints in the applications

2468
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:50,340
cheaper but never ending

2469
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:54,600
close to AP to is better but how can you

2470
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,520
change the stack

2471
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,500
and sometimes we do need to fix things

2472
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,540
in the internet make it smarter like red

2473
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:03,060
we designed red one day during the day

2474
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,460
and we pushed it out that night it was

2475
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:09,500
that fast because we needed it

2476
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,480
what I'm proposing is a simple proposal

2477
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,600
and that is provide for at the IP

2478
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,239
datagram level for their correction

2479
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,820
you compute the fact on the datagram

2480
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,800
chop into pieces

2481
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,960
minimally three pieces two for the

2482
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,320
datagram one for the fact and send these

2483
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,719
multiple pieces and then reconstruct the

2484
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,420
datagram from the pieces received and

2485
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:35,460
you have your your message

2486
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,639
you have a high reliability on a low

2487
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,619
lower reliability Network

2488
01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:42,540
take advantage of a technology that's

2489
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,820
around since 1960.

2490
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:47,219
and apply it here at the IP datagram

2491
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:48,600
level

2492
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,699
um the IB datagram level to limit the

2493
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:53,400
total data sent yes we can do this above

2494
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,840
transport we can do this in the

2495
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,300
application but then

2496
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:00,239
we'll end up having more data more

2497
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,920
chance laws do it at the IP datagram

2498
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,199
level and I think better things can be

2499
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:06,600
accomplished as a result and can manage

2500
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:10,340
the cost on the constrained links

2501
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,800
one so here's an example this very

2502
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,360
simple example

2503
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,100
um things that we've done with with

2504
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,380
reach Solomon reach Solomon was created

2505
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,800
back in 1960. so um IP datagram is n

2506
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,060
bytes long

2507
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:27,119
and make it even for Simplicity and the

2508
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:30,179
fact thus is n divided by two bytes so

2509
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:33,000
each datagram is 40 bytes for the IPM

2510
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
header plus M plus n divided by two

2511
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,060
bytes so your total is 120 plus 3 and

2512
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,760
over two is what you set to get the

2513
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,760
message across note that it's cheaper to

2514
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,619
send the packet twice if your IP

2515
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:49,920
datagram is less than 80 bytes long if I

2516
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,040
figured so they had one just send it

2517
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:55,320
achieve your reliability by sending the

2518
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,540
message twice

2519
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:01,020
um and there are smarter texts out there

2520
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:02,820
and otherwise do it if you have a low

2521
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,560
reliability you may like break the

2522
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,980
message into five pieces and have three

2523
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:11,580
um effect frames interspersed between to

2524
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:12,960
get to recovery

2525
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,780
the beauty of this approach

2526
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,280
is end to end

2527
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,340
there is no Global Effect defined no

2528
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:23,159
mandatory to implement what is your

2529
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:25,020
reliability you're trying to achieve

2530
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,360
between those parties that's effective

2531
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,000
use and it can be dynamic you can change

2532
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,860
the effect based on your what you're

2533
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:34,739
experiencing when you're experiencing or

2534
01:45:34,739 --> 01:45:37,500
how critical that male is to get through

2535
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,040
next

2536
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:44,040
and but how to do this how to add fact

2537
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,380
and this is where she comes to the

2538
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,440
rescue apply seek rules to the IP

2539
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,320
datagram then apply fact and send with

2540
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,560
Chic as the IP protocol next header see

2541
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,020
my presentation this afternoon in the

2542
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,239
lpwan about this subject

2543
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,480
use the Chic rule ID to include the the

2544
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,820
black number lower two bits if there's

2545
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:09,179
only like four packets and then apply

2546
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:12,119
signals in cheek on needing must deliver

2547
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:15,119
so the application says this must be use

2548
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,420
a Chic Rule and seek does the fact comes

2549
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,820
to the other side the seek module then

2550
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:23,280
does the reassembly and then passes a

2551
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,159
proper transport layer so there's a way

2552
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:30,000
we can do this if we provide seek as and

2553
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,920
see my presentation this afternoon next

2554
01:46:34,739 --> 01:46:38,580
ta-da it's easy to implement and to test

2555
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:41,100
to prove because we don't need

2556
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,780
infrastructure to test to prove this in

2557
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,100
fact it'd be good if we don't have

2558
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,020
infrastructure and we have bad links

2559
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:48,119
that we're testing it over

2560
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:51,300
um the endpoints do need cheek support

2561
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,280
um the internet needs to respect Chic as

2562
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,560
an IB protocol number that may be a hard

2563
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,600
one hopefully not just dropping it

2564
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,360
because it's a new IP protocol number

2565
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,760
and select the fact which will work plug

2566
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,619
it into Chic and we'll need some help

2567
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:07,260
here to do this sort of thing and then

2568
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,420
run tests over question reliable links

2569
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,940
and measure the success improvements so

2570
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,760
it would not be a long stretch of work

2571
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,880
to say does applying Forward Air

2572
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,920
correction at the IP datagram level

2573
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,520
increase our reliability of delivery of

2574
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,219
important messages regardless of what

2575
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:27,840
the wireless link May might be doing

2576
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,880
course Wireless sync don't forget that

2577
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,260
um the fourth what I think we'll be

2578
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,780
doing or what red may be doing in your

2579
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,159
environment

2580
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:39,320
and so next

2581
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,219
thank you

2582
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:43,199
are there any questions no this is too

2583
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,960
easy oh yeah our question there are

2584
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,760
questions I I'm watching the queue

2585
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,920
joining up so there's people in the chat

2586
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,420
raising a few questions and can I ask

2587
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,100
you to jump to the mic but we'll start

2588
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:57,010
off with uh Murray Joseph go ahead

2589
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:00,169
[Music]

2590
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:03,780
co-chair of a group that we closed a few

2591
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,719
months ago which was about that we're

2592
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,060
coding

2593
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:11,340
and we did look into exactly what you're

2594
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:14,639
saying read Solomon by the way is not a

2595
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,699
really good solution for the type of

2596
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:20,880
long-term uh and very large data sets

2597
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,219
we're looking at also

2598
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:27,060
um Reid Solomon requires to wait for the

2599
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,820
whole uh the whole block to be delivered

2600
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,880
before you can actually start

2601
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,040
um decoding which means that there's an

2602
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,360
awful delay

2603
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,719
uh Network coding research group

2604
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,060
identified a number of solution the

2605
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,860
problem that we had is that there's a

2606
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,840
lot of these Solutions were protected by

2607
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,219
IPR

2608
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:50,219
and you need to take that into account

2609
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:53,820
either IPR licensing issues

2610
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:56,580
um I agree with you that the uh the good

2611
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,980
one which is in open source for has been

2612
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,960
an open source forever Israel Solomon

2613
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,520
but I don't think Reid Solomon is going

2614
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,780
to help you here

2615
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,320
uh it's not good for for long long

2616
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,900
sequences so while I completely agree

2617
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,800
with you that uh adding fuc could

2618
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:14,719
increase

2619
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:17,639
the reliability and actually I would

2620
01:49:17,639 --> 01:49:20,400
actually as a as a professional in that

2621
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,360
field that would actually say it's yes

2622
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:27,719
but I think uh Reed Solomon is as I

2623
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,520
would say the lowest common denominator

2624
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,040
and there's been like you said 30 years

2625
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,800
of research on things that are better

2626
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,679
uh so I would like to know what are

2627
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,500
their Solutions if you if you look that

2628
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:43,860
are not block codes block codes are

2629
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,800
extremely bad for

2630
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,020
the type of solutions that are looking

2631
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:52,020
for raw because we need to have

2632
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:55,260
on-the-fly decoding and there are on the

2633
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,300
Fly decoding if you look in actually in

2634
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,699
the transport area

2635
01:49:59,699 --> 01:50:03,960
there's been a number of rfcs on related

2636
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:06,599
uh codes like I said some of them are

2637
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:09,239
protected by IPR some of them uh maybe

2638
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:12,179
more more open I think there's uh

2639
01:50:12,179 --> 01:50:14,340
probably some of this IPR that has now

2640
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:18,780
expired but I am surprised that you uh

2641
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,679
call it tada because it's not tada

2642
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:26,179
it needs a it's a very good

2643
01:50:26,179 --> 01:50:30,119
evaluation of what is needed and what

2644
01:50:30,119 --> 01:50:33,239
are the again the impairments

2645
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:39,138
of of Licensing and and IPR

2646
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,300
thank you very much what I have done

2647
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,900
here and my intention is that the block

2648
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,360
is the IP datagram

2649
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,820
I've done what little I've done by the

2650
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,880
way

2651
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:56,820
so it's it's potentially a very short

2652
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,320
thing you're applying it to and I only

2653
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,820
stumbled on dealing with this problem

2654
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:06,060
two weeks ago so my time in research on

2655
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,820
this is absolutely minimal I've not done

2656
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,420
the proper research on the different

2657
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:13,860
facts which are available which may be

2658
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:16,020
best I just grabbed something which was

2659
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:17,400
just easy for me to use this

2660
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,340
presentation but the intention here is

2661
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,739
that because as you point out you need

2662
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:26,099
to do this on a on a datagram level so

2663
01:51:26,099 --> 01:51:29,400
you can do the the encoding and decoding

2664
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,400
right out that packet

2665
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,699
which is good

2666
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:39,300
and and I'd be loved to talk with you

2667
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,219
and work with you and to be able to come

2668
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:43,980
with something which is appropriate to

2669
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:46,860
use that that will work better I only

2670
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,599
like I said let's grab the first thing I

2671
01:51:48,599 --> 01:51:50,940
could grab just to put it in and explain

2672
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:53,699
what could be done and what the approach

2673
01:51:53,699 --> 01:51:55,980
would be the next step is let's get real

2674
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,480
agree

2675
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:00,060
anything that works with wireless

2676
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,500
and Wireless

2677
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,880
uh type of error patterns it's obviously

2678
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,420
helped by some form of

2679
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:13,080
error coding at the packet level at the

2680
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,420
datagram level or even lower I'm not

2681
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,000
disagreeing with you here but I will say

2682
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,580
that there are already rfcs in the

2683
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,699
transport area and we've had a research

2684
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:26,580
group for for you know I think close to

2685
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:29,280
10 years so I'm surprised I was

2686
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,440
surprised that you did not mention that

2687
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:34,080
body of work I'm not going to jump in

2688
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,060
yeah I will leave I will leave that that

2689
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:39,300
floor to somebody else thank you Marie

2690
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,040
very valid point and this goes back to

2691
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,719
my my comment at the start of the

2692
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,820
session is there's loads of ietf

2693
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,860
Technologies out there perfectly valid

2694
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:48,540
for you to bring this Bob I I'm going to

2695
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:50,520
give Pascal and Liu a chance to to join

2696
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,040
the queue but I think yes as you admit

2697
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,900
you grabbed to read Solomon it was it

2698
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,580
was an obvious easy candidate for a

2699
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:58,980
short time this is a classic example of

2700
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,960
let's understand what else is out there

2701
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:04,980
but thank you uh Pascal go ahead

2702
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:07,440
so yeah you know about I have three

2703
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,900
reactions first uh that would be with

2704
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:13,139
the lp1 chair hat on I really love the

2705
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:15,960
idea that you want to use check to

2706
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,119
actually probably do the fragmentation

2707
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:22,980
and then add some uh more data which

2708
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,719
would be the Redundant data basically

2709
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,179
that the Chic layer would would use

2710
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:29,880
before you know fully expanding the the

2711
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,040
packet I really love that idea it's

2712
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,840
really nice extension to shake we are

2713
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,540
not charted for that but I hope that you

2714
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:38,699
know I will push to to get that shot I

2715
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:41,040
really love it now I'm not making any

2716
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,239
assumption on whether the street

2717
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,580
settlement or anything else but just the

2718
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,739
fact that could be used you know to

2719
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:49,260
to actually do the work now maybe there

2720
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,639
is a better solution but I love this

2721
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:52,260
approach

2722
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:55,679
um second is I love also the fact that

2723
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:58,619
Niger they came in and mentioned the

2724
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:00,480
work in transport because at the last

2725
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,520
interim we discussed that a lot of the

2726
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,679
things that we expect in the dead net

2727
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:06,960
architecture at the service layer

2728
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,900
are typically done usually in transport

2729
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:13,800
layers and the that's my point of view

2730
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,179
and not necessarily agreed with

2731
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:19,619
everybody right so my my own my own ad I

2732
01:54:19,619 --> 01:54:20,760
don't know whatever

2733
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,460
things like ordering it's something that

2734
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:26,099
typically does and transports will do

2735
01:54:26,099 --> 01:54:28,580
some transports will do and

2736
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:32,460
reliability fact or air QR what is also

2737
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:34,320
a transport and end-to-end transporter

2738
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,179
your thing which is exactly you know we

2739
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:38,580
are doing end-to-end reliability here so

2740
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,580
this is typically a transport thing and

2741
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:44,520
so yes we we probably need to have this

2742
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,320
discussion at some point of what of the

2743
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,000
definite features of the service layer

2744
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,280
are really layer three versus without

2745
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,860
effectively there are layer four and if

2746
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,239
you want to expand the work on them

2747
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,040
should that work happen at transport or

2748
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,260
Internet area so that that's the second

2749
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,340
reaction

2750
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,139
and

2751
01:55:01,139 --> 01:55:03,480
um yeah the third one which is yes the

2752
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,760
death net architecture includes

2753
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,860
effectively the sort of operation that

2754
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:10,320
you have and row expects that

2755
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:14,460
uh not only adding fact but also

2756
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:17,340
Distributing the different objects that

2757
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:20,760
you generate over different path

2758
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,699
so they you know if even if there is

2759
01:55:23,699 --> 01:55:26,580
like a solid block on the path of one of

2760
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:28,020
your three things

2761
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:30,300
as long as two of them pass then you

2762
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,340
make it through and two two to three

2763
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,780
just one number it could be five to

2764
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:36,060
seven or anything like that but the idea

2765
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:40,380
of taking one big packet uh could be 8K

2766
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:43,020
or whatever fragmenting it in two case

2767
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:45,540
because that's your that net uh service

2768
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:49,560
guarantee and getting six subject of two

2769
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,000
case

2770
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,219
um and then sending that over a row that

2771
01:55:53,219 --> 01:55:54,179
net

2772
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:56,219
that's expected that's really the sort

2773
01:55:56,219 --> 01:55:58,619
of thing we want to do

2774
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:00,540
um and in particularly Wireless that's

2775
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:01,920
really the sort of thing I'd like to see

2776
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,060
happen

2777
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:04,520
so

2778
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,639
thanks Pascal uh Lou

2779
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,440
super quick just want to highlight that

2780
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,560
what Pascal just said Network coding is

2781
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,080
called out in the net architecture is a

2782
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,179
possible solution to provide service

2783
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:20,340
protection if you have a specific

2784
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,480
proposal

2785
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,060
publish a draft bring it to uh net

2786
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:26,880
thanks just to Rick adding a chair

2787
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,900
comment

2788
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,940
um I don't believe unless there was a

2789
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:31,860
compelling reason that raw would

2790
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,440
disagree with any network coding that

2791
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,119
was built for detnet unless there was a

2792
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:37,800
compelling reason why it didn't work for

2793
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,040
wireless we would just inherit that yeah

2794
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,480
absolutely and if you needed some raw

2795
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,280
specific tailoring that this would be

2796
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:47,659
the place to discuss it exactly

2797
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,739
we would just be the place asking that

2798
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:54,900
Network on it or something that's that

2799
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:57,060
would be the the role

2800
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,099
absolutely yeah

2801
01:56:59,099 --> 01:57:01,619
Adam Whitaker another thing on this too

2802
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:03,480
I agree with Marie completely on the

2803
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,639
transport stuff uh and I was actually

2804
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:07,679
looking at Bob's stuff earlier and the

2805
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:09,980
first thing I thought of was Norm

2806
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:12,000
Norm is

2807
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,340
probably the right solution for this and

2808
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:16,739
it's already been defined completely but

2809
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:18,119
I was going to work with Bob on that

2810
01:57:18,119 --> 01:57:20,760
anyway off list okay

2811
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:21,659
so

2812
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:23,639
um I'm going to add one last piece to

2813
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:24,540
this

2814
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,699
um with my chair hat on thank you Bob

2815
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:29,760
this is a source of a valid discussion

2816
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,619
yes there is lots of pre-existing work

2817
01:57:31,619 --> 01:57:34,080
out there it is relevant to us because

2818
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,840
it's a common problem in Wireless as you

2819
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,400
get package drop

2820
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,440
um yes it's relevant to.net thank you

2821
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,760
for bringing it

2822
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,900
um I want to raise the follow-on

2823
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,340
question which I thought you might have

2824
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,980
addressed but you didn't which is

2825
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:49,440
uh probably are subject to be chewed

2826
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,360
over by everyone in the room which is we

2827
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,520
can build these reliable deterministic

2828
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,040
networks uh using a combination of debt

2829
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,460
net and raw where uh traffic flows have

2830
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,560
a certain scheduled uh bandwidth with

2831
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,860
latency and and controlled packet size

2832
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:07,860
and then if I run TCP over it the

2833
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:09,360
sliding window is going to ignore

2834
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,940
everything and drop all the packets

2835
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:15,420
automatically so I think there is an

2836
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:18,119
open question and we may not be at the

2837
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:19,619
right point to start addressing this

2838
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:21,300
because debt net raw haven't really

2839
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:23,400
finished their work

2840
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,280
what transport should be recommended to

2841
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:29,040
run over these systems from a general

2842
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,860
perspective so you don't unless you are

2843
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:34,260
your Navy broadcast company where you

2844
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,300
you have your own technology to run over

2845
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,560
it that's fine that's a self problem

2846
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,020
what if I'm a kind of a small startup or

2847
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:41,580
a man on the street and I just want to

2848
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:44,040
do some resty kind of thing over a

2849
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,540
deterministic network for some reason

2850
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:48,119
what protocol do I use for my transport

2851
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:50,520
and that's an open question

2852
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,560
to me it is someone got the answer tell

2853
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,580
me

2854
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:55,800
and I've already been had one pushback

2855
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:59,280
about you're busy Reinventing TCP why

2856
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,960
are you doing that but you just raise a

2857
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,659
point that maybe I do need to reinvent

2858
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:04,699
or at least

2859
01:59:04,699 --> 01:59:08,580
educate TCP for this environment yeah

2860
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,800
it's it's a that would be my question is

2861
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,139
do we educate TCP to understand this is

2862
01:59:13,139 --> 01:59:16,260
that then a debt net function or do we

2863
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:18,300
need a different transport and from the

2864
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,699
experiences for things like sctp uptake

2865
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:23,760
with middle Boxes Etc is always an issue

2866
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,500
um I'm watching the clock we have one

2867
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,719
minute

2868
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:29,820
for any other business thanks Bob you're

2869
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,860
welcome thank you all anyone else have

2870
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:34,500
ah Carson has jumped to the EQ go ahead

2871
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,420
oh sorry Pascal's first go ahead Pascal

2872
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,099
then jump jump

2873
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:40,800
yeah I I think our role here is not

2874
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,639
necessarily to educate TCP but mostly to

2875
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,860
figure out the sort of things we would

2876
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:49,619
like to see happen a list kind of all

2877
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:51,360
the services we could imagine that we

2878
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,040
would like to transport to be doing and

2879
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,159
then pass the big piket to transport

2880
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:58,980
area and say okay what do you have for

2881
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,520
us you know so our role is not to this

2882
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,800
say it's DCP or not TCP we I mean

2883
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,320
suddenly I cannot do that but at least I

2884
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,000
can you know knowing the performance of

2885
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,860
my network you can say hey I would

2886
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:12,599
really love a transport we can do which

2887
02:00:12,599 --> 02:00:17,460
can do this this and this that's true

2888
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,800
thanks Pascal carsten go ahead

2889
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,599
yeah just a quick comment I think we

2890
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,540
have to be careful that in making the

2891
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:27,599
network more reliable we don't start

2892
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,760
applying the transport service model to

2893
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,280
the network there is still an end-to-end

2894
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:35,639
argument uh here and a lot of people

2895
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:39,000
seem to think that that we can change IP

2896
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,580
so every datagram that is ever sent

2897
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:43,920
actually arrives and and that's not

2898
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,760
going uh to happen so let's not try to

2899
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,199
to change the IP service model and given

2900
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:54,560
that IP runs on a concatenated

2901
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,780
network we will always have the

2902
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,820
situation that various parts of the

2903
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:02,639
network have different cost structure in

2904
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:04,440
in actually achieving that reliability

2905
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:06,719
and that really has a lot of

2906
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,580
implications for the service model so I

2907
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:09,719
think we need to have a service model

2908
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:11,699
discussion

2909
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:13,980
yeah I think this is a huge topic and

2910
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,119
it's interesting

2911
02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:17,520
um I'm not proposing we we do it in raw

2912
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,920
I'm not even proposing we do it in this

2913
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,440
area but yeah I think it's it's one of

2914
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,300
those cool things the ietf was was born

2915
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:27,119
to do and to look at and argue about go

2916
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:28,440
ahead Adam I'm running out of time yeah

2917
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,420
very quick uh agreed with everything

2918
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:32,580
that Carson just said and also

2919
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:37,139
skips TP is another great thing that

2920
02:01:37,139 --> 02:01:39,840
should be utilized here

2921
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,239
okay um I'm gonna close the meeting

2922
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:44,219
thank you very much everybody for

2923
02:01:44,219 --> 02:01:46,199
attending in person or remotely uh

2924
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:47,820
hopefully we'll see more of you in

2925
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:49,619
person in London because it's always

2926
02:01:49,619 --> 02:01:52,080
nice to see people face to face but uh

2927
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,360
stay safe and uh we'll see some of you

2928
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,040
at the interims communicate on the

2929
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:59,280
mailing list please State your support

2930
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,739
for ldax if you have support for ldx

2931
02:02:01,739 --> 02:02:04,020
it's important to get that work moving

2932
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:06,179
otherwise thank you very much enjoy the

2933
02:02:06,179 --> 02:02:08,520
rest of your day and thank you very much

2934
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,679
to all of the people who have been

2935
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:13,500
helping with the um the minutes they're

2936
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,099
superlative

2937
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,739
I hang up and it ends I think so I think

2938
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:29,040
when the last person leaves it ends

2939
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,280
