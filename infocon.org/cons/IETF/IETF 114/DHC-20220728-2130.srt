yourself as here that gives us accurate

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
counts for who's here

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,880
um

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
note takers bernie's agreed to start him

also want to uh welcome tim because i

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
think this is the first working group

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
meeting we've had since you've been

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640

so with that i'll hand it back to you

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
awesome thanks bernie so this is our

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
agenda for today we've got a little bit

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
of the normal stuff going on the chair

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
slides

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
um we're going to talk a 8415 to

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
internet standard is our second bernie's

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
going to take that one and we've got

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,840
distributed sr6 locators by dhcp

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
self-registering

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
registering self-generated ipv6

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
addresses is our fourth one and then

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
we're going to talk a little bit about

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,400
net next steps at the end

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
so i'll do this one bernie since you're

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
going to talk a lot in a minute so

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
our current working group status is we

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
don't have any working group documents

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
at the moment we finally got the yang

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,480
model

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
through after some

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
trials and tribulations thanks to ian i

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
don't know if he's online but ian did a

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
lot of work for that to get that over

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,680
the

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
hump um but we did get it over

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
we have two related documents today that

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
we're gonna talk about both of them are

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
on the agenda so that's good um

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,239
milestones we currently have and

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
bernie's going to talk a little bit more

92
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,560
about this is

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
2023 and march of 2023 for um what to do

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
what we think the working group is going

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
to do going forward

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
um does anyone have anything they want

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
to change about any of this stuff any of

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
the agenda or any comments on that

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
seems pretty straightforward

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,400
okay

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
um

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
then bernie do you want me to share the

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
slides from here

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
sure yeah if you can do that

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
i can

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
all right the floor is yours

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
okay so we'll talk a little bit about

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
advancing uh dhcp v6 to

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
internet standard um

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,799
can i advance the slides no i guess

111
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
you'll do it

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,720
okay

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
so um the motivation for advancing

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
uh dhcp v6 to

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
enter its standard from what it

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
currently is which is proposed

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
um is really

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
because of the charter and the charter

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
that we uh did many years ago

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
uh we figured it was a worthwhile

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
endeavor to do and that was also the

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,440
reason we wrote rc 84

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
15 which really consolidated the base

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
specification from the you know three

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
core documents 3315 and the two others

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
you know the iapd

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,000
and stateless

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,960
uh plus a few others into a totally new

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
document

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
but you know we always have the choice

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
to uh leave it as proposed but i'm going

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
to go on the assumption that the working

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
group is interested

134
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
in doing that the work to move it to

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,280
enter its standard because we are pretty

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
close

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
so next slide

138
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,479
the requirements for

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
an internet standard

140
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
document

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
is

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
really um

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
four

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
key criteria

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
uh there are at least two independent

146
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,400
interrupting

147
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,840
inter-operating implementations with

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,280
widespread

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
deployment and successful operational

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
experience

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
there are no errata against the

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,639
specification that will cause a new

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
implementation to fail to interoperate

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
with deployed ones

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
there are no unused features in the

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
specification that greatly increase

157
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
implementation complexity

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
and four if the technology required to

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
implement the specification requires

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,600
patented or otherwise controlled

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
technology then the set of

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
implementations must demonstrate those

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,759
two independent separate and successful

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
uses of the licensing process

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
so let's go through each of those to uh

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
indicate where we are today

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,199
um

168
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,240
you know we

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
i think

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,919
there's no uh disagreement that we have

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
lots of independent

172
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
implementations that are interoperating

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
today

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
you know pretty much

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,639
we have things from cable modems to home

176
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,199
gateways to routers to servers to

177
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
laptops

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
even quite a few handheld devices you

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
know mobile devices and things like that

180
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
um all seem to be able to interoperate

181
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
and work

182
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
and you know do the ghp v6 standard

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
um you know everybo everything appears

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
to operate well from both the previous

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,319
usg v6 testing that was done at

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,599
um

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,919
the unh interoperability lab and

188
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,319
previously at cable labs uh field

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,800
deployments like comcast's broadband

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
service which is ipv6 based

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
and also uh things like the itf midi

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
network offers dhp v6

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
so i think we have quite a lot of good

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
implementations

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,000
and have no issue with that

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
we do have three reported errata

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
and

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,880
you know we do have some unused features

199
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,479
uh that

200
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
could be argued to add some complexity

201
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
complexity such as the iata

202
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
um

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
we have no

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
updated by that i could find but that

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
might be something to

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,560
to look through a little bit more

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
carefully

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
and obviously there's no ipr that's been

209
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,039
filed or that anybody has

210
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,080
claimed

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,919
um regarding rc 8415 or its predecessors

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
that i am aware of

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
um and has been reported to the ietf

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
um

215
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
you know there could be some

216
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
issues in the documentation in in the

217
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
standard uh that we might not have

218
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
had reported um you know if

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
anybody is aware

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,520
of any please file on rada asap

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
the mailing list i did do a quick sort

222
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,640
of scan of it does seem to have one

223
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,039
minor

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
item and that is that there was no

225
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
reference to rc 7943

226
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,519
which is in you know in section 13.1

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
which talks about

228
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,000
address predictability and you know

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
algorithms to use to select addresses

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
and i think that was just a timing issue

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
because while we were sort of you know

232
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,399
head down and and writing the

233
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
documentation we missed you know

234
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
updating rc 3315 and its friends to 8415

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
we kind of asked that this came out and

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
uh should have been included so that's a

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
pretty minor thing just add another

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
reference

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
um let's quickly go through the errata

240
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
because those are

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
potentially sticky items

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
um

243
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,399
one is just a typo where section six is

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
missing and closing parenthesis i don't

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
think that causes any interoperability

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,560
issues um

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,000
and depending on what we do if we do a

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
8415 biz

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
and if we drop temporary addresses the

250
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
section would disappear anyway so it

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
might be a non-issue to begin with

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
um

253
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,640
and we do have another type o in section

254
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,800
1838 which uses the word client instead

255
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,440
of server you know it's like

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
it's talking about what the server does

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,200
and it says the client

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
generates a packet well no it meant the

259
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
server generates a packet i think it's

260
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
easily understood to be a typo and

261
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,680
probably is not that um significant yes

262
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
it should be fixed and you know we'll do

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
that should we need to

264
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
um

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,200
then we have this errata which is a bit

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,839
more

267
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
involved um and this is an inconsistency

268
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,160
as to whether survey server unicast can

269
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
be used by information request

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,079
messages

271
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,200
um

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
and it it seems like the intent was that

273
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
they could

274
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
and so there are a couple sections that

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
have

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,880
uh some incorrect list of messages where

277
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
you know information request message

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,839
should be removed or or included

279
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,640
um and

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
um

281
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,160
there's also an inconsistency as to

282
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
whether server unit test option can be

283
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
used in a reconfigure message

284
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,959
um

285
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
so that would be another one uh to to

286
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
look at

287
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,040
there was some discussion on the mailing

288
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,079
list about this issue

289
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,040
and you know this

290
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
could

291
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
arguably cause some interoperability

292
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
issues although i'm not sure that it

293
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,959
really

294
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,959
has to to date but you know if a

295
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,560
client were to

296
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
use a server unicast

297
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
uh in an information request and the

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
server disallowed it then obviously the

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
server is going to probably send back a

300
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
malformed or dropped the packet and

301
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
therefore you know no progress

302
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,079
would be made by the client to to get an

303
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
answer to its information request

304
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
so this one

305
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
probably does require

306
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
a

307
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
correction and that would be done

308
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
through a biz document

309
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
um and then you know we have the this

310
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,519
kind of came up

311
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
during the 8415

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,320
discussions about

313
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,480
should we deprecate the iata

314
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
since most

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
clients never really use it

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
and you know it it kind of has

317
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
it you know

318
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
with with most

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
things being you know if monitoring is

320
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
being done it's probably using the

321
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
prefix the slash 64 or something like

322
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,920
that

323
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
and so the address itself doesn't really

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
matter that much when a client can

325
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
always just go ask for another address

326
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
if it wanted to

327
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
to anyway

328
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
um you know there is one subtle

329
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
distinction between an iana and iata

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
because an ia ta should not be put in

331
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
dns for example

332
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
so if dns updates are being performed by

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
a server it should not be doing an

334
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,600
update for an iata

335
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
so this is a discussion that we need to

336
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
have in the working group as to whether

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
we

338
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
should deprecate this

339
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,200
or or not

340
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
um you know the other question is are

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
there any other things in the document

342
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
that

343
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,240
might be considered uh to obsolete you

344
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
know we did obsolete some things from

345
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,360
3315

346
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
and i don't think there's anything else

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,839
but

348
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
it is a question

349
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
next slide

350
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
so as i kind of mentioned on errata

351
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,959
likely

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
the router likely requires a document

353
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,079
update

354
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
um

355
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
you know we'll we'll start with the

356
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
co-authors of 8415 biz assuming that the

357
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
working group does want to proceed with

358
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
this work

359
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,519
um to to start putting together the 8415

360
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,920
biz document depending on how what the

361
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,320
response is or if somebody has a really

362
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
strong desire to become involved

363
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
um you know that might be something that

364
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,000
the the remaining co-authors consider um

365
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
in working on the biz documents and who

366
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,000
who would be included the the work is

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
fairly small to integrate the errata

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
um you know removing the iata temporary

369
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
addresses is likely

370
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
a bit

371
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
messy i mean it's pretty straightforward

372
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
but there's you know there's quite a few

373
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,839
places where

374
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
uh the text would

375
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,680
get some sort of changes

376
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,519
you know i think there's also an

377
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
opportunity to shorten the document

378
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,639
which might

379
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,279
a little bit more powerful for the iesg

380
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,920
you be

381
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
when they have to go review this and and

382
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
or

383
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,639
you know the

384
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,600
other

385
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
uh people within the itf that need to

386
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,199
review this document

387
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,560
um

388
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,880
you know we can uh

389
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
remove a lot of the motivation for the

390
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
original rfc 8415

391
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
um

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,560
you know the some of the appendices were

393
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,399
fairly large because we made a lot of

394
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,959
changes and documented all those changes

395
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
and obviously now we would just document

396
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,240
what is new to 8415 bids from 8415.

397
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
you know one of the goals is to be very

398
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,920
careful to minimize the changes though

399
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
because that will make

400
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
our job as a working group to review the

401
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,959
document

402
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,360
uh much simpler you know when you look

403
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
at the diffs you'll you'll be able to

404
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
say yeah

405
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
you know i can see that the

406
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,839
you know the either i were corrected and

407
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
other things were done

408
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
so this is my straw for you know a what

409
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
i think is a fairly aggressive but

410
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
doable schedule

411
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
and that would be to publish an updated

412
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
you know biz

413
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,360
8415 biz document a zero zero version of

414
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
it uh before the november

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
uh ietf deadline um

416
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,279
you know again it's it's not a lot of

417
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,000
things to do but there are a few area a

418
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
few things that we the working group

419
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
and the authors need to discuss about

420
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,519
what do we do

421
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
uh both for fixing the errata and for

422
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
like removing the iatas

423
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,839
um

424
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
you know the working group

425
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
needs to do a good job at reviewing the

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
document because hopefully we can

427
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
complete that

428
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
um a couple of months you know two

429
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,839
months later

430
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
and then um publish uh the updated

431
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
document by

432
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
the art the march itf deadline to submit

433
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
it to the isg

434
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,720
one other thing is that i i

435
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
you know tim is a co-author i'm a

436
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,240
co-author

437
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,279
um and so we'll likely need to find um a

438
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
shepherd as the co-chairs will be

439
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
involved with the document but i'll

440
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,600
leave that up to the

441
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
a.d

442
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
uh to decide and maybe one of the ads

443
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,399
would even be willing to to shepherd the

444
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
documents

445
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,920
so

446
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
the the first big question

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,120
is do we go for it do people think it's

448
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
worth

449
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,039
advancing this to internet standard

450
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
so i don't know if you want to take a

451
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
a straw poll

452
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
tim in the room to see and

453
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
don't we have we have a voting tool

454
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,240
don't we here

455
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,119
yeah i'm putting one up

456
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,160
show of hands tool

457
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
yep i'm working on it

458
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,159
okay

459
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
should have been doing that earlier

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
okay

461
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
a pretty good response

462
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
yeah

463
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
okay so i i think that's definitely an

464
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,320
indication i mean obviously we're going

465
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,679
to go to the list with this but i think

466
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
that's a sign that people are interested

467
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,039
in doing this

468
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
yeah and i don't know is everybody in

469
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,760
the room there or is that just a online

470
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,200
participant

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
okay it's both yeah that's how it works

472
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,559
um we do have somebody wanting to come

473
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,840
to the queue

474
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,559
okay

475
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
hi mike ackerman my question is about

476
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
iata

477
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
and with the focus on security which

478
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,679
that is intended to do i think

479
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
why would it be a good idea to take that

480
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
out now

481
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,320
and i know you're going to say nobody's

482
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,600
using it

483
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,559
but

484
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,320
the folks that we use the most would be

485
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
enterprises like myself and we're not

486
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
doing anything in ipv6 yet but when we

487
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,600
do

488
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
this could be important so i guess

489
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,280
that's my question

490
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,000
well and and that is really the the

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
debate um it does add a little bit

492
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
complexity and since

493
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,360
you know its usage has been found to be

494
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,720
almost

495
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,760
zero

496
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,480
i microsoft has at one point was using

497
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,039
it i don't know whether they're

498
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
uh still doing so

499
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,799
um

500
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,520
so

501
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
you know i mean maybe that's uh

502
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
you know that's a discussion that the

503
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,360
working group should have is do we know

504
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,679
of implementations out there using it or

505
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
do we know of people potentially

506
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
interested

507
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,360
in you know now or in the future in

508
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,039
using it

509
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,679
yeah obviously

510
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,720
go ahead

511
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
i was going to say the case i'm making

512
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
isn't for anybody using it i'm saying

513
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
some of us might use it in the future

514
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
and i know that's not a very strong

515
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,799
statement but it's all i got right now

516
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,799
right

517
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,960
okay just my two cents thank you thanks

518
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
i'm going to close that poll

519
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,320
okay

520
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,000
so uh let me see

521
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
suresh

522
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,160
come on up

523
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
oh yeah

524
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
but that's not gonna

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
change

526
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
okay thank you uh so

527
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
bernie just couple of things um i think

528
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,799
um

529
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,760
one of the things i'm really worried

530
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,039
thanks

531
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,480
so one of the things is really like you

532
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
know this is like a really long process

533
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
and and uh

534
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,679
if you're going through with this i

535
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,280
think there's like some other stuff we

536
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,200
need to look at so there's a couple of

537
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,039
things that kind of caught my eye right

538
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,880
like you know like some of the late rfcs

539
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
right like you know seoul max rt and

540
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
stuff like that right is somebody using

541
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,919
it right like i think tim you would know

542
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
best like among all the people right so

543
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
maybe it also go over like a lot of the

544
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
when i say newer like probably like last

545
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
10 years right like all the stuff that

546
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,200
came out right like you know bulk lease

547
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,559
query stuff right yeah to see well so

548
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,760
yeah so

549
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,919
the vocalist query just to say is that's

550
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,120
a separate rfc and dot covered in the

551
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
base

552
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,679
8415. but things like the information um

553
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,039
sorry the the

554
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
solicit refresh timer and things like

555
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,600
that those are in there and yes we do

556
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,919
i i do know that there are devices out

557
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,400
there using that and you know they they

558
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
seem to to work

559
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,760
okay so yeah but yeah

560
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
i think we need to

561
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,320
you know i think tim um may have some

562
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,120
some to say about the usg v6 stuff

563
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
because some of the testing there

564
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
on the new uh dhcp v6

565
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
8415 work

566
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
uh focuses on some of that additional

567
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
testing

568
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
yeah so i'll talk a little bit about

569
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
this and kind of make a plug for my

570
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,919
friends at the unh iol so what we've you

571
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
know the ready logo has a new dhcp logo

572
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,919
we're working on we put it out for

573
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,360
public review

574
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
i said some notes about this on the list

575
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
the general idea there is to cover all

576
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,679
the new things that got included in 8415

577
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,440
like soul max rt

578
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
stateful issues

579
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
a couple of those things that weren't in

580
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
a 3315 standard

581
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
client or server so one thing you know

582
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
if you're interested in my call kind of

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
here would be is if you have an

584
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,640
implementation and you're interested

585
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
please talk to my friends at the iol

586
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,120
you know drop it off there they're just

587
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
looking for interoperability partners to

588
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
make sure that people have implemented

589
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
some of those more corner test cases

590
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
because a little bit of concern i'm

591
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,159
hoping by november we'll have better

592
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,679
we'll have better results to say yeah

593
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,120
we've got a bunch of people that have

594
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,480
done this i think we're kind of in a

595
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
state where i think some of it's been

596
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
done like soul max rt is in the home

597
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
gateways for sure

598
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
but i i don't know what it looks like

599
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
for enterprises for example so i think

600
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
some of that we're gonna have to sort

601
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
out that make sense right i think the

602
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
idea would be to kind of make it easy

603
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
for eric to kind of defend this right so

604
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
if the information is ready to go i

605
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
think it's easier for him to like defend

606
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,919
something that eric like to will would

607
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
say like hey like you know this is where

608
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,679
it's implemented and so on because like

609
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,200
we kind of remove the implementation

610
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,799
status and everything from the rfcs

611
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
right so it'll be good to kind of have

612
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,480
this information ready because this is a

613
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
really long process and

614
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,360
i i did 8200 like and it's like and and

615
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
it's like really tough on the 80 so it's

616
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,559
uh

617
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
it's probably good to kind of have

618
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,159
a good idea of like you know what is

619
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,799
really yeah out there like okay thanks

620
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,360
that's good now

621
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
yeah we probably need you know we'll

622
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,400
probably need to develop some kind of uh

623
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
feature

624
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,919
uh matrix or something to

625
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,400
to see you know have have these

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
combinations been tested especially

627
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,679
about some of the newer

628
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,799
uh non-basic sort of stuff

629
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,160
um

630
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,760
[Music]

631
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
so you know what what can you do to help

632
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
in the short term uh well for the

633
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
um

634
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
you know co-authors i need to hear from

635
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,400
you whether you're interested in working

636
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
on this or not

637
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,960
um

638
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
and you know if anybody has else has a

639
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,279
strong interest let me know

640
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,320
um you know you can send uh to dhc

641
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,279
chairs

642
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,240
um if you are interested

643
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,799
um that way tim's aware of it as well

644
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,360
and um

645
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,600
the other thing is you know

646
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
if you have

647
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
any

648
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,919
issues that you've

649
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,799
had with rc 8415 any typos errors

650
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,240
uh you know more

651
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
severe

652
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
mistakes or whatever

653
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
you know do report them um ideally it's

654
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
best if you report them as the you know

655
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,039
using the errata stuff but if you don't

656
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,640
want to do that

657
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,440
you can send them to dgchairs at itf.org

658
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
for now as we'll collect them we might

659
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,159
you know depending on how the

660
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,400
the dhcp uh v6 biz team wants to work we

661
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
might open up a different mailing list

662
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,320
as we kind of did last time but i think

663
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,400
this is a hopefully a

664
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
smaller effort and we won't need to do

665
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,840
that

666
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
um the other thing is that you know it's

667
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,320
it's again something in the future but

668
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
we need people to review the document

669
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,240
when published and do it properly

670
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
um

671
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,159
and you know give us updates quickly so

672
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
that we can get new versions correct

673
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
new corrected versions out as soon as

674
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,919
possible so that's it

675
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,840
awesome thanks bernie i think we got our

676
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
next steps here so we'll take some stuff

677
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
to the list for sure

678
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
all right

679
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,880
let's see next up is um the dhcp

680
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
sr locator and then

681
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
let's see

682
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,639
i'll put up the slides

683
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
all right

684
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,039
let's see

685

slides or you're okay if i do it

691
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,640
uh i can do that

692

hello everyone uh i'm with sancho from

696
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,720
uh

697
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,159
channel mobile i will

698
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
present

699
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
this

700
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
slide

701
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
to

702
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,880
show the distributor sr6 located by ds

703
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,840
dhcp

704
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,439
and uh

705
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,480
okay

706
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,520
so

707
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
here the

708
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,360
figure shows the network architecture

709
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
of a telecom operators

710
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,960
the applications narrow here

711
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
is a

712
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
private line and vpn services for

713
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
enterprises

714
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
the cpus are located in the

715
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
customers

716
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,039
sites

717
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,360
the number

718
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
will be very large

719
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,120
even

720
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
more than

721
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,080
50 000

722
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,760
around the country

723
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,440
with a wider

724
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
geographical

725
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
distribution

726
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,039
some of them

727
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,200
may be based on 4g or 5g

728
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
with a high mobility

729
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,760
in order to keep the network simple

730
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
the cps

731
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,799
often

732
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,039
do not deploy

733
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,120
igp

734
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,020
so recently

735
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,120
[Music]

736
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,640
many people

737
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
many operators

738
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,720
have deployed

739
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
large scale as rb6 networks

740
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
the cps also begin to support

741
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
srv6

742
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,840
so that operators can provide

743
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,000
the end-to-end

744
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,720
srv6 vpn to customers

745
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
it's a little bit complicated to

746
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
configure

747
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,520
the i76

748
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,159
we hope to simplify the configuration

749
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,480
and hope the cpe can

750
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,399
dynamically learn

751
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
assam 6

752
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,679
located

753
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
subnet routines

754
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
that's why we write this

755
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
proposal

756
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,159
the

757
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,360
proposal is very simple

758
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,159
the basic idea is that

759
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,360
we treat

760
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
i-76

761
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,799
locate as

762
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,080
the ipv6 prefix

763
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,799
in prefix support

764
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
the key points i hear

765
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,320
the first one

766
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,679
is

767
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,640
the dxcp v6 server

768
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
allocates

769
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,159
srv6 located

770
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,640
as a prefix

771
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,720
and the second

772
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,799
follow the dhcp basics prefix

773
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,360
delegation process

774
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,799
and the third

775
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,840
after

776
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,080
the located prefix assigned successfully

777
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
the bus

778
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,320
dynamically

779
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,559
distribute

780
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,919
the locate subnet routine locally and

781
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,200
distributes the

782
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
local uh

783
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,080
located

784
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,799
uh

785
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,600
sub

786
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,679
subnets routines to arsenals

787
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,000
in the network

788
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,679
and the the

789
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
force when

790
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,279
the locator prefix

791
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
is released

792
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,960
the brush deletes the locate subnets

793
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,399
rotis

794
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,200
here the brass need to

795
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
enable the hcp v6

796
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,600
pd server

797
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,039
or dhcp v6 release agent service

798
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
so

799
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
before

800
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,600
we

801
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,720
introduce

802
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,840
the dhcp extension i would like to

803
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,880
share the basic information about the

804
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,799
srv6

805
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,600
seed format especially

806
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,399
the

807
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,919
comprised

808
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,519
assab6 seed format

809
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
which is

810
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
illustrated

811
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,440
the

812
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
bottom of the

813
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
slide

814
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
for the comprised seat

815
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,200
the locator

816
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,000
will be separated to two parts

817
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,120
the

818
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,279
common

819
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,399
part

820
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,960
we call that locate block

821
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
and

822
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
the

823
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,480
different part

824
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
we call that locate note

825
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,679
other field are the same with the

826
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,840
original

827
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
seed

828
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,159
which define the fc

829
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,240
89 86

830
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,399
so

831
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,960
about the extension

832
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,279
we hope to define a new srv6 locator

833
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
option

834
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
it will be

835
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
encapped and

836
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
facilitated

837
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,640
in the ia prefix options field

838
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,960
of ia prefix option

839
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,200
it will be used to identify

840
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,120
srb6 locator prefix

841
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,039
in ia prefix option and

842
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,559
carry

843
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,720
srv6 locator

844
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
subnet

845
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
information

846
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
the format

847
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,240
shows in a faker

848
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,799
firstly we need a

849
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
new

850
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
option code

851
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,559
for the

852
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,679
option assignment 6 locator

853
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
the second

854
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
we will have a

855
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
locate a block length

856
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
field

857
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,760
that indicates the

858
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
locator block

859
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,960
the length of the locator block

860
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,000
in a comprised state

861
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,880
if

862
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
it's not zero

863
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,760
if

864
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,320
it's a zero

865
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,159
it will indicate

866
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:22,840
an

867
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,720
original as a b6 seed

868
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
and

869
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,559
we need a

870
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,679
function

871
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,919
lens field

872
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
which

873
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,120
indicate

874
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
the lens of function

875
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,399
we need a arguments lens

876
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,320
field

877
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
it will

878
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,799
indicate

879
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,120
the length of the argument

880
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
that's the basic

881
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,279
extension

882
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,399
here

883
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,200
the

884
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,480
srb6 located prefix

885
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,559
is

886
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,239
filled in the ipv6 prefix field of the

887
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,800
ia prefix option

888
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
the

889
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,480
locate prefix lens

890
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,399
is filled

891
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,079
in the

892
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,679
prefix lens field of ia prefix option

893
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,079
so that

894
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,599
you can calculate

895
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,879
the

896
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,440
located node lens

897
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
based on

898
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,280
the information here

899
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,800
so all the

900
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,719
lengths of the field

901
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,000
for the comprised seed or for the

902
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,918
original seed

903
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,839
can be

904
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,800
get

905
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,839
generated based on the

906
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,520
information

907
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,359
in the

908
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,000
extension

909
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,560
hider

910
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,160
and

911
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,960
yeah this is the basic

912
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,760
relationship

913
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
for the

914
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,880
srv6 locator option i think it's very

915
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,000
simple and iapd option may contain

916
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,599
multiple

917
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,640
ia

918
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
prefix

919
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,280
options

920
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,040
at the same time

921
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
and

922
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
ia prefix option

923
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,359
can only have one srv6

924
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,200
locator option

925
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
at at most

926
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,280
uh this is based on

927
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,599
the rfc

928
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,599
8450

929
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,839
and

930
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,760
let's see some

931
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
application scenarios the first one

932
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,560
the brass

933
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,440
works

934
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,400
as

935
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
the scp scp-v6

936
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
pd server

937
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,759
at this moment

938
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,078
the

939
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
favorite

940
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,800
second generate the

941
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
locate subnet routine locally

942
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,920
the third

943
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
distribute the

944
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,079
locate

945
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,880
subnets routine to

946
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,040
other ipv6 node so it's very simple

947
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,839
and

948
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
the second scenario

949
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
brass

950
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
works as the htcp

951
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,599
basics

952
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,359
really agent

953
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,079
it's also very simple

954
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,280
the behavior like that first

955
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,960
release dhcp basics pd

956
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,160
allocation messages

957
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,240
the second generate the locator

958
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,119
subnet routine locally the third

959
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
distribute the locate prefix

960
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
rotates to us ipv6 node

961
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
so that's

962
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,119
the basic behavior

963
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
for a really agent

964
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,359
so that's all

965
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,400
any questions or comments

966
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,839
bernie i think you beat him in line so

967
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,200
you can go ahead

968
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,439
okay

969
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,640
um

970
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
so

971
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,079
you know if so a client sends this new

972
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,280
option

973
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
in a request

974
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,520
or you know solicit

975
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,400
things

976
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
and a server

977
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
that's aware of this option would send

978
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
one in a reply so

979
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,760
you you know the client can know oh yeah

980
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,079
okay the server understood this

981
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
but if a server that doesn't understand

982
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,160
this

983
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,359
new option

984
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,680
it will respond

985
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,000
with a prefix because this is going to

986
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,079
look and say oh see i said i see a

987
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,079
request for a prefix oh i'm going to

988
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
assign you a pre-tax

989
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,280
um

990
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
and so now

991
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,599
what does the client do with that prefix

992
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,280
that it got

993
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
that

994
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,520
it's not

995
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
you know it

996
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
it it's not it doesn't have this your

997
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,000
new option in it the uh

998
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
ia

999
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,680
srv or whatever it was called

1000
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,320
um yeah srv6

1001
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
locator option in it so the client will

1002
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,960
go well this isn't an srv6

1003
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,160
thing

1004
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,079
so is the client going to turn around

1005
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,680
and release it

1006
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,040
you know so i think that's something

1007
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,920
that needs to be thought out is how does

1008
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,760
how does a client

1009
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
make sure that when it asks for one of

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
these things

1011
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
that

1012
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,119
it unders it knows it got one and it

1013
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,119
that i think you've got the check on

1014
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,000
that

1015
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,640
but if it how does it know or how does

1016
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
it what does it do how does it deal with

1017
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,200
it if if the server didn't

1018
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,000
know

1019
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,119
about this srv6 locator option you know

1020
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,520
and just assigned a prefix

1021
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,400
from its prefix pool

1022
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,640
so

1023
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
yeah i think

1024
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,760
this is a

1025
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,320
very good

1026
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,160
question so from my point of view

1027
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,520
for the server

1028
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,400
if

1029
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,079
it

1030
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,520
don't

1031
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,079
doesn't know the option

1032
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,760
it will

1033
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,640
ignore the new option right

1034
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
that is a basic behavior

1035
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,520
for the server

1036
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,319
which to handle the new option

1037
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,440
and it just

1038
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,200
treated as the

1039
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,599
original prefix

1040
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,400
allocation that that that is okay

1041
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,119
well the server doesn't understand the

1042
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
option it's going to allocate a normal

1043
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,760
prefix right and you've

1044
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
wasted a prefix

1045
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,079
potentially because the client can't use

1046
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,200
it for

1047
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,040
the srv6 purposes right

1048
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,680
yeah that may be

1049
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
that that may happen but

1050
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,200
you know this system

1051
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,880
will

1052
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,240
be maintained

1053
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,839
in

1054
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,800
one operator's

1055
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
network

1056
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,599
i think it uh it's easier to generate

1057
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,720
some

1058
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,240
basic policy to avoid

1059
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,720
this kind of uh

1060
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,960
problem

1061
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
well i think for interoperability

1062
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,520
reasons right you should

1063
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,560
it's

1064
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
i mean you can't argue this is a closed

1065
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,599
system right people can plug things in

1066
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,040
and stuff so

1067
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,000
i

1068
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,560
think you need to think about how to

1069
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,680
deal with that you know i mean one

1070
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,560
one thought maybe that you want a

1071
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,680
instead of

1072
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,960
putting it in

1073
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,280
a standard prefix option maybe you want

1074
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,720
to

1075
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,160
add a new

1076
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
you know ia srv6

1077
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,440
option right which says hey this is an

1078
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,000
srv6 locator you know so you want an ia

1079
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,960
option

1080
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
for this

1081
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,480
yeah

1082
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,079
that's possible i think he

1083
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
we should consider

1084
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,119
uh

1085
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,119
the question uh later and uh

1086
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,720
hope we can

1087
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,200
uh handle it

1088
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
thank you

1089
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,520
yeah

1090
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,960
and you know i'm not i'm not going to um

1091
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,280
i i can't say whether this is a good or

1092
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
bad idea because i'm not really an srv6

1093
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,359
expert and so you know i think that

1094
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,240
there

1095
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
it will be good at some point to get

1096
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,480
some input from

1097
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,280
uh

1098
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,800
some people that have more of this

1099
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,520
experience because and and

1100
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,599
you know i mean this is a protocol

1101
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,040
option

1102
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,520
probably if especially if it's an ia and

1103
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
so it should be done in the dhc working

1104
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,560
group but we are going to need some

1105
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,079
expertise to help us

1106
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,880
yeah maybe we can also

1107
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
uh

1108
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,560
submit the draft to spring working group

1109
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
and maybe we can

1110
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,160
also

1111
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,880
apply some slot

1112
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,680
in

1113
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,520
spring working group to present it and

1114
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
to see

1115
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,240
the feedback and comments

1116
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:20,880
okay

1117
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,680
um we got 15 more minutes let's let eric

1118
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,960
and suresh say there uh yeah eric i'm

1119
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
gonna run real quick actually because i

1120
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,480
think bernie said everything i wanted to

1121
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,000
say i'm just gonna say

1122
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,839
uh i think uh the dhc idiomatic way of

1123
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,280
doing it is probably to define a new

1124
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,200
option which bernie suggested i'm going

1125
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,480
to go ahead and guess that the reason

1126
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,839
that maybe you didn't propose that is

1127
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,599
because the b-raz might not be able to

1128
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,119
be updated

1129
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,520
uh i don't know if that's a really

1130
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
good

1131
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,319
reason or not and secondly as uh well as

1132
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,000
temporary delegate delegated

1133
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
responsibility i was going to say it

1134
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
definitely does have to have uh review

1135
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,440
from from spring

1136
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,920
yeah and we if if we adopt this work we

1137
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,480
also need you know permission from our

1138
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,720
ad

1139
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,440
okay

1140
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
okay thanks

1141
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,880
okay i think that's everybody okay great

1142
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
thank you

1143
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,040
thank you

1144
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,759
let's see

1145
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
again i think you're up

1146
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,000
well

1147
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,200
i'll let you two work this out

1148
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,440
whichever one of you wants to get up

1149
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,440
here

1150
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,359
there we go

1151
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,359
doing it with my hat on the whole like a

1152
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,520
d hut thing doesn't yeah okay

1153
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,640
so hi everyone um

1154
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
my plan was that i was going to be in

1155
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
the grow working group and jen was going

1156
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
to present this so i am in no way

1157
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,680
prepared

1158
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,480
so

1159
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,800
i'll make this up as we go along

1160
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,119
so this is registering self-generated

1161
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,240
ipv6 addresses using dhcp v6

1162
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,359
and

1163
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,720
thank you

1164
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,599
this is who we are the draft is actually

1165
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,400
based on an earlier document from suresh

1166
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
and rajiv and some others

1167
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
um but you know it's myself

1168
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,520
lorenzo

1169
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,040
jen at some point

1170
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,200
so that's us next slide

1171
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,359
why are we doing this

1172
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,359
because eventually asking people have

1173
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,440
you tried turning it off and on gets

1174
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
really old

1175
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,440
so what are we trying to do what's the

1176
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,160
problem we want to solve

1177
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,119
so

1178
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,880
a fairly common

1179
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,040
thing with like it help desks and

1180
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,640
security people

1181
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,359
is they need to do things like find what

1182
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,680
ip address a machine has

1183
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,839
um with ipv4

1184
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,280
the ceo can't print to his printer

1185
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,359
he calls up and he's really annoyed

1186
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,680
people look in the dhcp logs

1187
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,680
they find the iep address based on the

1188
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,240
mac they ping the printer

1189
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,400
they you know things work out and

1190
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,240
they're happy

1191
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,880
if you're doing ipv6 with slack

1192
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
the ceo calls up and says he can't print

1193
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,480
to his printer

1194
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
and you say have you tried turning it

1195
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,839
off for none again

1196
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,160
and he says yes and you say uh have you

1197
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,319
tried turning it off and run again and

1198
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,040
he says yes and then you go post your

1199
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,520
resume on monster right if you just have

1200
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,440
the mac address it's really hard to

1201
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,520
figure out what ipv6 address somebody

1202
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280
has

1203
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,079
um

1204
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,839
next

1205
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,480
one the other common use case

1206
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,200
is security operations folk

1207
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,119
have something where you know last

1208
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
thursday at 2 43

1209
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
they have some ids log

1210
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
that shows that some machine uploaded

1211
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
their entire source tree to stack

1212
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,640
overflow

1213
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
what they'd like to know is

1214
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,319
which employee had this ip address at

1215
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,359
this time

1216
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,520
or what machine had this ip address at

1217
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,960
this time

1218
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,559
with ipv4 the obvious thing is you have

1219
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,119
the ip address you go look in the dhcp

1220
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,760
logs you find the mac address

1221
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,000
and then hr goes along and visits the

1222
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,280
employee and says you did what

1223
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,720
um with v6 what you say is uh

1224
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,880
that's not good i have no idea who used

1225
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,240
that address they assigned it to

1226
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,319
themselves with slack

1227
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,240
and then once again you post your resume

1228
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,559
on monster.com

1229
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,960
next slide

1230
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,839
um so obviously you know the problem is

1231
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,920
that a lot of people

1232
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,599
a lot of devices

1233
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,400
run slack and don't use dhcp for doing

1234
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,000
address assignment

1235
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440
that's actually what's happening on this

1236
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
network when your machine joins this

1237
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,480
network

1238
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,920
you do slack

1239
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,839
and you get an address

1240
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,920
and the network doesn't really know what

1241
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,000
it is like the network devices do but

1242
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,839
there's no central tracking of it

1243
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,920
anything like that

1244
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,160
um an option would be you know tell

1245
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
everybody you should do dhcp for address

1246
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,599
assignment

1247
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,520
that doesn't always wind well it doesn't

1248
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,680
look like it's going to happen

1249
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,359
so what are we actually proposing

1250
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,559
as i say this was um based on an earlier

1251
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,200
draft which was suresh rajiv and i can't

1252
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,800
remember who else wrote it

1253
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,920
yep

1254
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,160
which was basically doing registering

1255
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,520
self-generated ipv6 addresses in dns

1256
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,559
using dhcp v6

1257
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,240
and it

1258
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,559
went along fairly well but then it got

1259
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,960
stuck in working group last call

1260
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
and as far as i can tell almost all of

1261
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,000
the unhappiness was about the dns part

1262
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,079
of it so how do you take this address

1263
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,920
and authenticate it that this client

1264
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,319
should be able to update that dns

1265
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,760
address

1266
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,920
so we did is we took out all of the dns

1267
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,960
bits

1268
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,760
and made a few other changes

1269
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,680
and what we're left with is

1270
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,559
a method to inform a dhcp

1271
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,480
v6 server that a device has a

1272
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,559
self-generated address or a statically

1273
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,640
configured address

1274
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,800
what this does is it allows the dhcp

1275
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
server to log this information and

1276
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,520
ideally also stick the information in

1277
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,839
its lisa's file so that it knows or

1278
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,200
lisa's database

1279
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,880
so that it knows that the address is in

1280
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,760
use and it doesn't try and hand it out

1281
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,839
in reality that's not likely that bigger

1282
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
problem you know the chances of multiple

1283
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,640
people choosing an address and a dhcp

1284
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,079
server trying to assign it are fairly

1285
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,119
low but it's still useful

1286
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:51,920
this

1287
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,160
solves the helpdesk use case when the

1288
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,079
help desk wants to figure out what ip

1289
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,480
address a certain mac address has it

1290
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,640
looks in the dhcp logs

1291
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,760
um it also solves the secops problem if

1292
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,520
they want to know what mac address an ip

1293
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,440
address was a while back they look in

1294
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,520
the logs or what other

1295
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,200
sort of tooling is around the dhcp

1296
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,359
server

1297
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,720
the way it does this is it's fairly

1298
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,760
simple

1299
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,800
there's a dhcp v6 address notification

1300
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,760
message

1301
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,119
which just says

1302
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,839
hey i'm using this address please make

1303
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,520
note of it

1304
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,680
um

1305
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,079
does this actually actually solve the

1306
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,760
secops problems

1307
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,040
well

1308
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,960
only kind of

1309
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,599
because of reasons what you actually get

1310
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,440
with dhcp v6 is you get the duid yeah

1311
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,200
and that's a whole site better than

1312
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,800
nothing at all

1313
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,559
often it is actually based on the mac

1314
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,680
address but not always

1315
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,280
if it's a device that your security

1316
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,960
group has heard about there's a

1317
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,640
reasonable chance they could actually

1318
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,640
like log the duid in an asset database

1319
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,720
and if they don't do that you know

1320
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,400
there's also client link layer address

1321
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,720
option in dhcp v6

1322
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,599
which a number of

1323
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,400
network devices implement and so that

1324
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,480
information shows up in the log

1325
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,960
i tested it actually with ios xe on the

1326
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,119
ietf wi-fi network

1327
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,480
dhcpd and microsoft seemed to support it

1328
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,640
or there is what i think was being

1329
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,800
discussed when i first walked in

1330
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,480
which is a update to

1331
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,319
uh 621

1332
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,800
where a bunch of bngs and brasses and

1333
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,359
similar can include you know the

1334
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,839
the address in the

1335
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,079
message um

1336
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,559
i wrote these slides a long time ago yay

1337
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,400
the next one's questions

1338
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,920
so

1339
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,640
i made up most of the talk on the fly

1340
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,520
um who has questions or is this the best

1341
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,160
idea ever

1342
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,480
bernie do you have you were up there i

1343
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,400
don't know is it the worst idea ever

1344
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,800
yeah okay um

1345
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,480
well i don't know you know is i'd have

1346
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,720
to go back to the notes about why we

1347
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,960
didn't like it that much in the first

1348
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,599
place i i guess i just have

1349
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,559
one

1350
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,960
question and that is that

1351
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,440
you know if if a device were to remove

1352
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,720
itself

1353
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,200
from the network

1354
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,440
um you know it's not defending its

1355
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,960
address

1356
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,880
um and another device comes along and

1357
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,040
registers it you're just gonna say the

1358
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,960
dhcp server basically has no

1359
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,160
responsibility to say hey i got a new

1360
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,240
you know i got an updated thing it's a

1361
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,319
totally different client but i'm going

1362
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,480
to record it

1363
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,640
sort of what you're expecting yep at the

1364
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,319
moment it is purely

1365
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,200
the client sends a message that says i'm

1366
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,400
using this and the dhcp server logs it

1367
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,160
if another client comes along and says

1368
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,520
i'm using this the dhcp server logs it

1369
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,559
um it's just a you know i get this no

1370
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,480
useful sanity checking

1371
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,079
so clearly there are some ways this

1372
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,920
could be abused right like people could

1373
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,119
say that

1374
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,920
somebody else was using the address

1375
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,160
um

1376
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,559
attackers could also if they wanted

1377
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,400
never send the message like even if it's

1378
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,720
built into their os if they wanted to

1379
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,240
hide who they are

1380
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,599
when they join the network they could

1381
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,160
suppress the message from being sent

1382
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,640
but i still think it's a lot better than

1383
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,160
not having

1384
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,720
having any information um

1385
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,520
so

1386
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,200
sort of very perfect versus the enemy

1387
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,599
the good good type thing

1388
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,720
did that actually answer your question

1389
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,640
or did i answer a completely unrelated

1390
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,319
question oh that that's good

1391
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,400
kathy's going to tell me why i'm wrong

1392
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,319
wow did i really just call you kathy

1393
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,520
that's okay my god i've known you

1394
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,880
forever

1395
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,760
um

1396
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,119
so that was mostly what i was thinking

1397
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,480
but this is just a fire forget thing

1398
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,319
yes it sends it there's no consequence

1399
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,240
there's no acknowledgement required i

1400
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,920
actually i believe that you're supposed

1401
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,079
to get back an act but you don't have to

1402
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,520
i can't remember if we had the act in

1403
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,280
the end and you send a couple and jen's

1404
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,200
gonna correct me

1405
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,880
as far as i can remember what you're

1406
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,720
doing we saying

1407
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,079
that you refresh it periodically and

1408
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,920
actually draft has two conflicting

1409
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,280
sentences currently and you have the

1410
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,200
github issue for that

1411
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,760
but i think we discussed the idea of arc

1412
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,000
and decided not to because you never

1413
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,559
know if your server actually understands

1414
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:29,520
it

1415
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,800
so and we also only require a client to

1416
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,359
send this if there is a more bit set an

1417
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,640
array indicating there is a dhcp server

1418
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,559
because i definitely don't want clients

1419
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,799
to send those messages if there is no

1420
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,680
dhcp in the network whatever so but we

1421
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,079
still client still has no way to know

1422
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,960
what server actually supports so just

1423
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,799
i'm sending kate if you're happy to log

1424
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,359
it log it or drop it to

1425
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,880
yeah it's stateless it's the whole idea

1426
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,720
like client

1427
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,040
will like really to inform server and

1428
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,079
server willing to do whatever

1429
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,640
it goes like if you if you're sending

1430
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,599
career with mo you kind of indicate into

1431
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,000
client is there is a dhcp somewhere

1432
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,359
client sending it to all dhcp link local

1433
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,559
multicast

1434
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,640
so again if there is no such thing on

1435
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,359
the

1436
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,079
segment it will just go nowhere if there

1437
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,079
is a relay agent it means the network

1438
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,760
operator kind of expects something like

1439
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,920
that

1440
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,559
uh it times out we have some sorry i'd

1441
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,920
actually misunderstood your question i

1442
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,280
thought it was a

1443
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,200
i'm using this address and the dhcp

1444
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,359
server can say no so i misunderstood

1445
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,799
your question i'm not really wondering

1446
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,040
what the responsibility is of the dhcp

1447
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,839
server the dhcp server's responsibility

1448
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,920
is log this

1449
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,799
um

1450
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:51,920
optionally

1451
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
note it in sort of your

1452
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,559
wherever you store lease information and

1453
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,480
so you don't try and hand it to someone

1454
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,480
else that's optional but you just put it

1455
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,920
in there and it stays in there you stuff

1456
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,760
it nope it times out after an amount of

1457
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,799
time

1458
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,280
we the exact amount of time the authors

1459
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,319
are still

1460
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,839
fighting over

1461
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,280
um

1462
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,799
we just as long as it turns out

1463
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,400
eventually it times out eventually it's

1464
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,400
like does it time out in four hours or a

1465
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,200
day

1466
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,119
or whatever is

1467
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,119
is that like deciding the best answer

1468
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,040
that's a bit tricky but it times up it's

1469
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,359
not infinitely growing it's also if for

1470
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,000
example your disk gets full

1471
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,920
the dhcp server is allowed to throw them

1472
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,640
away or if it's having a bad day it's a

1473
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,400
best use only that was exactly what i

1474
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,319
was thinking about is you know getting

1475
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,160
basically ddosed by a bunch of goofy

1476
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,599
clients just sending stuff that you

1477
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,880
don't even care about but then you have

1478
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,799
to keep and yep yep you're allowed to

1479
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,400
ignore them if you feel like it and yes

1480
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,000
they will time out

1481
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,480
um part of the thing is there's like 17

1482
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,920
different timers that we could base the

1483
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
time out on and is it like the lowest of

1484
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,079
this one unless it's more than x versus

1485
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,559
you know so the exact number is d

1486
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,720
the

1487
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,520
to be decided actually that sounds

1488
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,640
better

1489
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,880
any other yeah we got a couple more we

1490
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,359
got hazel here online

1491
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,000
hi hazel smith um

1492
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,280
i was wondering if this had if this did

1493
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,880
have an act then conceivably you could

1494
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,559
if you were designing you know access

1495
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,440
switches you could use this sort of ip

1496
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,040
source card v6 and basically say like

1497
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,119
um if you've actually got a lease from

1498
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,520
the atp's v6 you can use this address or

1499
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,160
if you've sent an announcement saying a

1500
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,839
notification saying i'm going to use it

1501
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,760
and the http responded

1502
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,520
sure fine with me

1503
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,359
then you allow it otherwise you don't

1504
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,640
which would then give you some kind of

1505
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,480
assurance that

1506
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,160
if you later see packets on the network

1507
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,559
with the ip address that they

1508
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,240
came from the device with the mac

1509
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,160
address that had told you it was going

1510
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
to use the ip address um i've no idea if

1511
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,520
that will be a valuable concept but

1512
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,599
um yeah thank and thanks hazel like i

1513
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,359
think one of the worries is that right

1514
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,040
the dcp server doesn't support it and

1515
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,880
you're waiting for like the dhcp server

1516
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,200
to say it's okay that that could lead to

1517
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,040
like you know somebody not having access

1518
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,280
to that sorry that's the worry and

1519
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,960
that's why it's kind of going as best

1520
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,240
effort to

1521
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,319
go through but i i think it's like

1522
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,520
fairly available if you have like a

1523
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
controlled system and this is something

1524
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,880
that you know it's going to happen we

1525
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,400
can probably like you know set up

1526
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,160
something like regard kind of thing

1527
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,520
right it can hook up to something like

1528
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,040
regard and to do that but yeah but

1529
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,520
otherwise like it's going to be

1530
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,119
a bit tough to like lock it down too

1531
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,559
much right this is the best effort yeah

1532
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,520
yeah so can i quickly just follow up on

1533
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,559
this there is a other concern we expect

1534
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,000
the client only report preferred

1535
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,280
addresses

1536
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,520
which means by the time you send this

1537
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,680
applications might already want to send

1538
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,079
traffic so if you want to do something

1539
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,640
like savvy it's better to use dad on

1540
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,680
sales stations or any other form of

1541
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,760
client willing to get an address and it

1542
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
might be way too late here to do

1543
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,960
anything based on dhcp registration

1544
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,640
and i guess i'll add something to that

1545
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,440
like

1546
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,040
one of the other bits on my badge is

1547
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,280
like knock monkey and we've been having

1548
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,599
a lot of entertainment at this meeting

1549
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:12,640
with

1550
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,079
um

1551
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,760
ipv6 and dad and the network devices

1552
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,160
going oh i don't think you should really

1553
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,400
have that on that port i mean actually

1554
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,960
what it's doing is it's sending its

1555
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,680
like device tracking message from

1556
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,599
um colon colon

1557
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,839
because of entertaining bugs so like the

1558
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:32,720
whole

1559
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,040
your switch can do

1560
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,720
mac address learning and locking down

1561
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,480
just as like terrifying but that's my

1562
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,839
personal

1563
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,079
vendors love it

1564
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,920
okay we've got one minute left eric you

1565
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,880
wanna

1566
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,400
yeah uh eric can hear i just wanted to

1567
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
say that doing this for

1568
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
anything other than purely informational

1569
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
purposes like as tempting as it is and

1570
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,160
as fun as it is to be like hey i should

1571
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,440
take this into account when giving out

1572
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,599
leases like it seems like there's a huge

1573
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,680
can of worm stop in there so here's a

1574
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,440
centrally known place to log stuff as

1575
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,920
like cool great have at it have fun log

1576
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,119
as much as you feel like if it's too

1577
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,040
much just start ignoring them

1578
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,040
everything else starts to seem sketchier

1579
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,599
and sketchier

1580
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,960
thank you very much uh we have

1581
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,079
go ahead

1582
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,359
we've got one more person we're going to

1583
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,520
sneak in here in the last 30 seconds go

1584
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,920
so um have you thought about

1585
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,559
perhaps routers or other network devices

1586
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,960
faking these messages to get a

1587
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,480
more populated lock

1588
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,160
sorry to get a more watch

1589
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,720
um to get a more populated look so

1590
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,040
also lock clients that are not

1591
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,520
collaborating yeah somebody suggested

1592
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,079
that um you know a device that sees

1593
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,480
somebody using a mac and ip could send

1594
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,160
this i think that that sounds like a

1595
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,839
really bad idea

1596
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,040
um

1597
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,480
mainly because

1598
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,880
it seems like a lot of complexity

1599
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,720
like a router could be like i saw this

1600
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,559
guy using this ip and mac i'll send it

1601
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,280
off i think that bad mojo but it could

1602
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
be done okay

1603
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,480
all right awesome i think we've got some

1604
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,680
good stuff to talk about here on the

1605
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,799
list

1606
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,200
um i think that's everything we had on

1607
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,680
the agenda

1608
