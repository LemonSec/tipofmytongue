20
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640

so please be aware this is a recorded

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,319

under the no bill of the ietf

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
um if you are here for a while already

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,319
then you're probably pretty familiar

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,360
with that

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,319
um

31
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
i want to highlight if there are any

32
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
conflicts that you

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
encounter just try to uh

34
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,360

all the itf and ipr works

39
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000

room

45
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
that's really useful uh not to uh

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
discriminate the remote attendees that

47
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
reaction actually or the line

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
please use that

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680

echo and raise your hand there

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920

we don't have yet a assigned

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
javascript would somebody

63
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
like to take that up

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,478
yeah

65
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,399
that would be awesome

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
also notes

67
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
uh

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
i don't think it's a hard thing uh notes

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
can be reached via the meet echo site

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
there's this little notepad icon on

71
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,960
there next to the iot ops um item on the

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
session thing

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,919
but it's also here on the slide and

74
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,520
michael just raised his hand thank you

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
for that

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
yeah well

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
pretty much everybody should have found

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
me echo by now but yesterday i think

79
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,280
obviously if your items today are mostly

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
uh that's reporting on work that needs

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
some cross pronation so that's great i

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
think

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
um we have a i think a very interesting

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
new item on authentication methods here

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
a report of snack that's nice

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
uh we will have to above the theft i

87
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,039
think that is uh i think overall very

88
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,400
interesting topic

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,199
um there i actually have not read a lot

90
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
of the internet exposure analyzer yet so

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
i'm i'm really uh curious about that one

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
but i'm also such a so i heard a little

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
bit and then we will

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
talk a long time today it will probably

95
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
take a long time today to talk about um

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
what we're going to do in the next

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
year so there's a candidate for adoption

98
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
here and brent will talk about that and

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
that will require that's why this is

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
plus 20 minutes i think a little bit of

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
uh

102
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
um finding ourselves there um i know

103
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
again at this time we are 32 attendees

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
that is not the best situation to make

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
guiding decisions in a room but i think

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
we can have tentative discussions on

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
where this

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
journey can go and

109
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
i want to give the opportunity to bash

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
the agenda right now if anybody has

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
something to add to this

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
please speak up or raise your hand in

113
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,639
the queue or whatever right here with

114
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
the bike

115
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,080
going once

116
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
going twice

117
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
the agenda's fine

118
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
and we have an open microsoft and

119
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
everybody uh changes their mind there

120
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,639
will be uh time for that

121
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
so this is the uh introduction of slides

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,840
from my side

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
um quickly looking back at the jodenda

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
we are starting with hannes so i will

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
pick that

126
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
and share it

127
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,240
and i hope that works

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
pretty fine

129
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,479
recently

130
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,240
okay uh

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
yeah it's a relatively short

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
presentation because i don't want to

133
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
repeat what i had said in other

134
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
presentations before but i would like to

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
there was one presentation on sunday at

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
the hota rc

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
and another one on this topic

138
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,199
during the dls working group meeting

139
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,160
um

140
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
but since the week is over we had many

141
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
discussions i would like to reflect a

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
little bit on on what i've heard and

143
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
maybe you find that interesting too if

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
you work in this at the station space

145
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,159
yourself okay

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
so this is one of the models outlined in

147
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
the rats architecture model this is the

148
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
background check model one of the the

149
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
two models that is used to

150
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
pass um

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,440
evidence and at the station results

152
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
around

153
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
and one

154
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
where i found out during the week

155
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
and then i've seen other proposals

156
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
beforehand there are different ways that

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
people think they should be sending

158
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
uh evidence and attestation results

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
around uh in this in this for the

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,720
background check model this would be

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
evidence sent from the desktop to the

162
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
relying party which is then sent to the

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
verifier and the result comes back to

164
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
the relying party

165
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,120
that's what i explained in case of the

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,759
dls embedding this information in dls

167
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,440
handshake during

168
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
tls working coop session but there have

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
been other

170
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,120
proposals

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
um

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
sort of uh outlined

173
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,599
during the meeting

174
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
uh this week

175
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
for example

176
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
i want to highlight the use of

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
attestation information in x 509

178
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
certificates

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
um

180
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
so that would then equally go into the

181
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,759
dls handshake because the certificate

182
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
there is as well it's just a different

183
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
layering

184
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
of that information

185
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
and then of course um

186
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,960
there are ways to

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
really relay that information at the

188
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
higher lay in the protocol stack um

189
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
there's a proposal by

190
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,919
by intel on how to embed this in http um

191
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
but there's there have been also

192
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
proposals to do it higher up in the

193
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
application layer for example on top of

194
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,680
um

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
like on top of co-op not

196
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,839
as a

197
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,360
payload in in for example lightweight

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
into them

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,080
okay uh that's kind of the the state of

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
affairs so lots of different activities

201
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
so that sort of gives me a little bit

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
impression that there's um

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
a broader

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
sort of a number of industry players

205
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,920
being interested in utilizing at the

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
station information uh that is provided

207
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
by

208
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
uh hardware in in some of the newer

209
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
platforms and make it available for all

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,760
sorts of different use cases next slide

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,880
[Music]

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
as i mentioned like i talked about the

213
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
dls

214
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
based version and that was an initial

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
version like many of the other documents

216
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
or solutions i've i've

217
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
briefly mentioned

218
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,839
the

219
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
after the meeting netsmith came to me

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
and and we agreed that we would be

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
working on a comparison because there

222
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
are subtle differences between

223
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
between the different approaches so it's

224
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
not

225
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
irrelevant on where you stick

226
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
information in

227
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
and

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,480
how you do that sorry certain use cases

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
favor one approach versus the are

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
probably less than ideal in other cases

231
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,640
so we wanted to

232
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
highlight this and bring this

233
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
to this group potentially because it

234
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
could be a good um

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
i think a good item it doesn't actually

236
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
fit into other groups per se like in

237
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,200
rats

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,279
or in in let's say the dls group or like

239
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
what other groups so maybe maybe this

240
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,279
could actually be a home for such a uh

241
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,360
comparison document that then points to

242
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
the other documents that are being

243
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,600
worked on in the idf

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
that would also since they

245
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
there's also a lot of commonality um for

246
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
example

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,399
um i was asked about use cases and and

248
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,399
with the background of like how does

249
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
privacy influence those use cases so

250
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,160
those are

251
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
the privacy aspects show up regardless

252
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,959
of whether you carry something at um

253
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,000
let's say the tls layer versus in a

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,279
certificate in the tls layer

255
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,440
um one other thing for those who are

256
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
participating in the confidential

257
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
computing consortium which you by the

258
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
way can um you can join the meetings

259
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,640
even without being a member of the

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
consortium so those are public meetings

261
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
they are held on a regular basis so if

262
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
you if that type of

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
sort of

264
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
technology is of interest to you uh feel

265
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
free to join and they're also

266
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,519
um

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
collaborating on projects so there are a

268
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
number of software projects in the ccc

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
already

270
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
for example on some of the enclave and

271
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,079
technologies

272
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,600
and so um

273
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
we will be contributing um the

274
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
implementation worker poc work on on

275
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
this topic uh to the ccc

276
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
and um there will be discussions next

277
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
week on that

278
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
uh assuming that it works out um

279
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
you will hopefully see some some code in

280
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,839
the in the near future you can play with

281
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
and yeah with that i want to conclude so

282
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,079
if um

283
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
anyone of you is is interested in any of

284
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
this would like to try out uh

285
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
implementations which

286
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
work uh

287
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
in the group somehow want to be involved

288
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
in the discussions uh

289
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
let me know

290
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
so already three people lined up

291
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
and yara is first

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
yeah yada yada

293
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,680
so first i want to support this work i

294
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
think it's important we need it and uh

295
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,720
please go ahead uh i'm i'm certainly

296
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,959
personally interested in this

297
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,240
um i don't have a huge uh comment on on

298
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
this like the new details of the

299
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
different variants which one is the

300
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
right one and so forth um

301
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
you know you guys have to work that out

302
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
but we have to work that together but um

303
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
i i think

304
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,800
based on my experience at least when

305
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
we're building some some things that

306
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
needed this these types of

307
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
at the station designs then

308
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
uh

309
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
it was our preference that we would have

310
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
had like a libraries available that you

311
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,639
know the standard tls library we enabled

312
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,720
to do this would allow us to do that

313
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
based on our requirements and so on

314
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
um

315
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
and it could be in some other libraries

316
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
but but it like it felt at the time at

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
least that there's like

318
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
clear need for this but not a lot of

319
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
standardization or available uh

320
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,760
implementations in the different

321
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
toolkits so so i think both the open

322
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,600
source and

323
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
and the standardization aspects are are

324
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
important so i'm happy to contribute if

325
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
that helps

326
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
i wonder whether uh it would also be

327
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
useful to maybe at the next idf meeting

328
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,760
maybe hackathon to actually

329
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,279
sort of play around with some of that

330
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
software stack because it's obviously

331
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
there's

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
a lot of different components and each

333
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
component by itself may be fairly simple

334
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
to use but once you glue everything

335
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,959
together it gets complicated

336
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
that's that i think that would be useful

337
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,720
and i i do think that it does get

338
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
complicated and that's also

339
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
it may be a point to be uh thought of uh

340
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
when like you brought up this that

341
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
there's different ways of doing this and

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
when we have

343
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
15 different options you know what

344
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
happens to interoperability so that's

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
not necessarily great

346
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
that that's true um i was more referring

347
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,279
to um in this case

348
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,560
um

349
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
with confidential computing you have a

350
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
lot of layers of software

351
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
um

352
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
like

353
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
you need to have some some normal word

354
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
software you have these enclaves the

355
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
software is running in the enclave or in

356
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,399
this trusted execution environment and

357
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,480
so there are piles of software that you

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,800
would normally as a developer not deal

359
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,079
with um

360
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
and so so that may be

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
new and and maybe surprising uh

362
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,760
so maybe that that could be an

363
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,800
interesting

364
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
sort of exercise to get something

365
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
working and and

366
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
have a working system

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,040
at the end of the hackathon

368
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
michael urgent i haven't read this

369
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
document um but the title sounds really

370
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
good especially if you were to uh

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,399
append for iot devices at the end

372
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
um uh but i i i i'm i guess i'm

373
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
i think i think it would be

374
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
i i'm not i'm not clear why this doesn't

375
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
belong in tls or rats

376
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,120
uh but um but on the other hand you know

377
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
this working group has not adopted any

378
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
documents and i think that that's that

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,920
sounds this actually sounds like the

380
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,519
kind of thing that we were kind of

381
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,800
chartered to do

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
so i i think that would be really cool

383
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
and i'll go read the document and

384
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
i totally agree with you that that this

385
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
would be a really also a good hackathon

386
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,759
kind of effort

387
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
um to

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
to put the different things together and

389
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,079
that you know

390
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
that 2020 berlin hackathon was also

391
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
really really uh a good kind of uh uh

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,959
thing

393
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,839
um

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,199
and uh

395
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,480
anyway we should do something like that

396
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,880
again thanks

397
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
thanks thanks

398
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
so next is me as a contributor so no

399
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,720
hats

400
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
um

401
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,839
i like that your title site is called

402
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,040
attestation and that you think you know

403
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,399
what that means

404
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
and and and

405
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
actually as a contributor that is a

406
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,279
really really really hard thing out

407
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,880
there so i will put something to the

408
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,959
chat here right now that is a link um

409
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,360
i i saved it by we were preparing this

410
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
actually it's from nist

411
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
and it tells you what attestation is

412
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,040
and it is not what you think it is okay

413
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,839
it's derived from iso i think one seven

414
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
zero zero zero

415
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
and it's basically endorsement

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,079
so and this is this is a whole s-bomb

417
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
space so i think um when you compare

418
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
approaches you should also and i

419
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
actually would

420
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,480
really me to contribute that part

421
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,399
because i'm like a broken record when

422
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,560
i'm starting a sentence with i'm like

423
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,079
sounding like a broken record now people

424
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,839
start to laugh because they already know

425
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,000
what i'm going to say yeah because this

426
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is an overloaded term and a lot of

427
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,839
people mean endorsement with this

428
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
there's no evidence involved there's

429
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
nothing in this diagram you're short

430
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,240
involved it's just saying i have some

431
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
opinion about the software and i'm

432
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
signing my opinion with an identifier

433
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,240
about the software at the end

434
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
so that is very very complicated and

435
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
this is really making people talk past

436
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,319
each other so such a comparison is also

437
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,400
of course i think somehow maybe in a

438
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,679
dimension here

439
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,919
and then i don't know i usually i see

440
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
net on this um on the slide

441
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
um that's httpa right

442
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,799
yeah okay excellent because that would

443
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
perfectly fit into this uh comparison

444
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
okay yeah yeah uh so that that would be

445
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
so there

446
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,280
that's the httpa uh which is not in the

447
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
iedf um

448
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
and maybe it would be uh

449
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,280
um there's not good http this is on

450
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
record now yeah and then uh what doesn't

451
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
do the minutes

452
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
there is um extensions to uh x549

453
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
certificates that were presented during

454
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
this week's meeting in the big kicks

455
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
working group um and then as i said like

456
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
there are other approaches at higher

457
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,320
layers so so there's a lot of

458
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
interesting work and maybe maybe it

459
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
doesn't matter that much and like

460
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,160
like everyone should do whatever they

461
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
find best for the use cases but uh

462
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
illustrating on what technique works

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
best in what use case uh could be useful

464
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
yeah so some um

465
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,679
incubation document will not be the tls

466
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,280
at the station document right that

467
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,120
that's true yeah so we have to start

468
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
some some nucleus somewhere and you will

469
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,080
you will do that as you yeah okay great

470
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
thank you okay

471
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,799
so coming up next

472
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
i should know my agenda better

473
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
this

474
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
michael okay yeah your snack report do

475
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
you need slides for that

476
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
i didn't get slides that's that's why i

477
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,320
don't find slides yeah no so that's

478
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
going to make the it's really really

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,039
short so

480
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
uh on monday morning

481
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
first thing by hannes

482
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,200
um there was a buff on connectivity uh

483
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
within

484
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
uh home mostly home networks called

485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,520
snack

486
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
um if you weren't there that's sad for

487
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,000
you

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
but that's why you're listening now um

489
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
it's it

490
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,520
my summary my one minute summary is that

491
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
it looks like we will have a working

492
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,120
group formed soon and that

493
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
the charter was well discussed and the

494
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,720
problem statements was reasonably well

495
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
understood

496
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
and that if you weren't involved in it

497
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,799
you probably should think about it and

498
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,559
it's pretty relevant to

499
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,960
connectivity in the home

500
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,679
for iot networks so that's really it i

501
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
just wanted to let you know

502
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
and i have no official standing in any

503
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
of that process so

504
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,280
but i thought it was important that we

505
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,120
put it on this agenda thank you

506
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,559
that was

507
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,240
pretty much not five minutes but thank

508
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
you

509
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,799
going from there

510
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,039
the next one is

511
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
dirk

512
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
okay i'm getting your slides up

513
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
i think

514
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
yeah

515
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,360
you can share this let's see okay i

516
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
wanna do the right one let me check

517
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
again

518
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
why is he off i think so hard to find

519
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,520
it's just a tiny way ah there it is okay

520
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
right and there we go thanks a lot yeah

521
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,559
so my name is dirk von hugo i'm uh with

522
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,960
deutsche telekom still and together with

523
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,679
beshet zarikaya we

524
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
have been

525
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
working on some time on

526
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
the question what could be the

527
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
one of the major applications for next

528
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
generation

529
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
networks and on the next slide

530
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,440
truly that's not uh

531
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
you usually know so

532
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
we think that uh

533
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,919
things like iot applications

534
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
will be uh

535
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
in the future very much important for

536
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
uh

537
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
environment for

538
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
um yeah okay no that

539
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
will be important for

540
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
for everything i think

541
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
uh somebody say already 5g is the

542
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
the network for iot applications but

543
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
perhaps more and really ultra massive

544
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
iot will only come

545
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,080
afterwards when we have really

546
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
heterogeneous access networks when we

547
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
have

548
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,080
uh more cheaper devices for everybody

549
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
and for a lot of applications

550
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
and

551
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,159
of course there's a lot of different

552
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,240
aspects with iot

553
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
they have to be highly efficient have to

554
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
be highly reliable

555
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,039
and if there's some receive

556
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,159
amount of devices deployed then the

557
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
scalability is very important but

558
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,159
the last and not the least of course is

559
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,039
the security because we think

560
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,760
if

561
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
everybody in his house has a lot of

562
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,679
devices and it's too easy to

563
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
to attach them or to to access them

564
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,159
this of course opens big risks uh

565
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,559
distributed denial of services only one

566
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,039
a lot of more i think will come into

567
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
play and

568
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
therefore we need here strong access

569
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
admission control and a strong

570
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
authentication

571
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
and this is what we had on this next

572
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
slide that we say okay

573
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,840
we think uh okay usually we have

574
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
uh some kind of

575
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
on the left side industrial iot like for

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,039
the power grid and for vehiculars and

577
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,320
for industry and so on these are devices

578
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
which are normally

579
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
by definition high-end or

580
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,840
kind of platinum devices with

581
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,799
a very elaborated and

582
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,080
complex

583
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
we say 5g like kind of security

584
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
capabilities but if it comes to the

585
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
household appliances

586
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,559
like on the right side

587
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,960
they are normally just very affordable

588
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
and should be convenient for the user to

589
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
deploy and install them and this may be

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,360
a

591
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
question of what's the cost but

592
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,039
it will perhaps not be a 5g and a sim

593
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,320
card inside

594
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
but other kind of

595
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
authentication should be used

596
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,159
and what we think

597
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,520
if we really go to such a massive amount

598
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,360
then based on human intervention uh

599
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,159
like their 802.1x

600
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,320
this does not really fit for this use

601
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
case

602
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
uh and therefore

603
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,919
we provided this or we think the term

604
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,559
hardware-based authentication means that

605
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
we have in the device also a

606
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,840
interface for detecting or sending

607
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,240
video signals sending led

608
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,919
light or

609
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
audio streams or something

610
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
which the device the access point can

611
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,559
detect and

612
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
from that authenticate the device

613
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
would be perhaps a good

614
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,640
idea or is already proposed also

615
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
as out of band channel

616
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
you surely know eep noob which uh uses

617
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
this

618
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
and it also then uh fulfills this

619
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
two-factor authentication that we have

620
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,919
something independent of the

621
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,159
communication channel the second one to

622
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,080
authenticate

623
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,120
that we think for this we

624
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,880
yeah we should

625
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,919
think about this procedure how to

626
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,720
how this could be

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
designed or what it would look like

628
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
and

629
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
yeah and besides this video audio there

630
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,159
may be also a detection just of

631
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,360
gestures of shapes or so and this is on

632
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
the next slide i think then

633
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
yeah

634
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
focus on windows yeah okay thank you

635
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,640
that these uh dumb devices

636
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,960
uh perhaps it may be even too costly to

637
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,080
have an led light in this device so

638
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,520
uh but there are this is a later on but

639
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
in the beginning we said we have kind of

640
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,640
uh

641
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,200
requirements or challenges set up that

642
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
uh

643
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,799
for instance the user who is installing

644
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
the device and the device themselves are

645
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
separate and not physically connected

646
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,240
the user has not to be there to do the

647
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,080
installation or the authentication to

648
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,200
the network

649
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,080
and also then there may be a unique

650
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
identity for the user and all his

651
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
devices or

652
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,080
an identity where the identity of the

653
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,880
devices can be derived from so that is

654
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,640
more easy for

655
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
normal users like me to install this

656
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,200
at home

657
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
and of course then the authentication

658
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
should be mutually so the device should

659
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
authenticate to the access network and

660
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,279
vice versa the x network to their device

661
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,520
but it should be anyway very simple

662
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,679
because the devices should be cheap so

663
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,720
there

664
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
should not be required that there is a

665
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
pre-established relation between

666
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
the devices and the application of the

667
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,440
server or whatever it is or the users

668
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,720
themselves

669
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
and that also not a

670
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
device identifier should be

671
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
pre-provisioned by a

672
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,799
fabrication

673
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,240
or also any authentication credentials

674
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
and

675
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,039
that this

676
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,960
second device a second input output

677
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,640
interface for the out-of-band channel

678
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
maybe only uh one directional so just

679
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
sending some light

680
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,279
or sending uh playing a melody or

681
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,880
just any uh

682
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
doing some activity

683
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,120
without detecting it

684
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,240
and uh yes as i said this additional

685
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,960
interface like led or audio for this

686
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
out-of-band channel may be a cost factor

687
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
so we had the idea or the we

688
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,919
found that there's this radio signal

689
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,760
sensing which is both done at the ieee

690
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,480
with wi-fi sensing but also in 3gbp for

691
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,159
5g and 60 run they have these studies so

692
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,919
that we have one antenna for sending and

693
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
receiving the signal and analyzing the

694
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
signal uh modification by the

695
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
environment

696
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
to uh to provide the second channel so

697
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
this but this is only a

698
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,399
one one example for how to do it

699
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
uh especially because perhaps we then

700
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,840
don't need uh lined outside and have any

701
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,919
other

702
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,159
requirements which may be required for

703
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,679
led

704
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
but this the the method of course should

705
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
be independent of this technology itself

706
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
and i think in the next slide we have

707
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
then some kind of a

708
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
idea how such a

709
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
message sequence charge could look like

710
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,520
between the device and the

711
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,120
access point which senses this

712
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
second

713
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
second channel or this token or this

714
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
information sent by the second channel

715
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
and then of course is connected to kind

716
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
of an

717
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
aaa

718
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,120
client and triple a server where this uh

719
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
information is

720
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
then uh acknowledged and

721
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
well then in the end then the device is

722
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,679
given the admission to access the

723
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,880
network

724
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
uh during the bootstrapping procedure

725
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,360
and this is just a quite uh rough idea

726
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,559
we have

727
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,919
not so much

728
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,000
information or not so much thoughts

729
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
already

730
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,039
spent on which

731
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
parameters could be

732
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,320
provided between the iot device and the

733
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,360
access point so what is the capability

734
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
of the exit point to detect which kind

735
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,559
of signal or what the device can

736
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,840
provide and how to characterize it how

737
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
to categorize it

738
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,640
or a general nice description of how

739
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,960
this token should look like so this is

740
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,159
all which has to be

741
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
maybe specified later on and then also

742
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
about the naming of the device and

743
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
perhaps a renaming of the device if it

744
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,640
is reused in another environment

745
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
and whether how this could be uh

746
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
combined to the geospatial information

747
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
on where devices placed

748
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,360
uh they may be standard uh

749
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,320
standard uh parameters to to be used

750
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
and of course also then uh what is

751
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,960
existing already for with the sensing

752
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,159
access points

753
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,039
uh

754
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,880
by ieee this does not allow for a mesh

755
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,760
setup for multiple meshed access points

756
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,600
but just for a single one and this

757
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
should be also then a technological

758
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
extension

759
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,919
and also multicast communication

760
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,760
should be perhaps provided and enabled

761
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
and

762
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
that's then what we think

763
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
we have perhaps to extend the existing

764
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,360
rfc 9 140 on this nimble out of band

765
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,520
authentication for erp

766
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,039
to eap to uh to allow for

767
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,360
this requirements to be fulfilled and

768
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,120
perhaps even much more

769
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,679
we had not yet uh in mind

770
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,240
but uh yeah therefore are we

771
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
bringing this to this working group and

772
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
asking for

773
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,320
a review it's on the last slide i have

774
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
then now uh

775
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,520
this is now the o2 version we had done

776
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
some improvements since the

777
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,399
uh zero zero version also discussing

778
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,600
with michael and others and uh yeah we

779
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
would uh

780
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,159
like very much if somebody can review

781
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,240
and uh look at the document and comment

782
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,480
on it whether this is useful

783
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
within this working group so at the

784
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,559
moment it is more a problem statement

785
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,399
but perhaps it can

786
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,799
point towards some uh possible solution

787
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,240
space

788
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
and yeah and uh that would be then

789
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,880
perhaps in the question later on to

790
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
adopt this as a working group document

791
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,679
if you think this is interesting

792
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
yeah and with this i want to thank you

793
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
and

794
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,880
questions either now or also we can be

795
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
contacted

796
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,720
yeah are there any comments or questions

797
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,240
immediately from the room or remote

798
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,440
if not

799
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,159
my question would be um is there anybody

800
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
willing to have a look so you were

801
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
asking for review and

802
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,679
sometimes putting people on the spot

803
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
helps so is there anybody

804
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
interested here on the

805
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,000
remote uh to have a immediate look at

806
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
this

807
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,320
or is this

808
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,919
out of your school and there's somebody

809
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,600
joining oh i should pay attention to

810
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,840
that

811
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
yes janfit

812
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
uh yeah hi um

813
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,559
so um i'm i i haven't read the draft i

814
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,159
would be willing to read it and

815
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,440
especially since you mentioned eat noob

816
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,799
um and in emu i'm looking into ibnoob

817
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,080
and um i've found some some some issues

818
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,519
with it and i'm

819
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,350
currently working on on a

820
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,960
[Music]

821
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
another draft to to redo

822
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,240
the same thing but not with jason but

823
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
with sibo

824
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
so i would be very interested to

825
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
see or i would take a look at the draft

826
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
and i would be very interested if you're

827
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
interested as well

828
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
um to collaborate maybe on uh looking

829
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
into how noob or

830
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,440
then the new specification could fit

831
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,000
into that

832
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,279
thank you okay okay always make sure

833
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,000
that

834
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
review comments are visible so emails to

835
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
the list are of course in this context

836
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,279
welcome

837
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,600
is next

838
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,640
so i think this is interesting i i have

839
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,240
read the draft um briefly and um

840
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,799
i think uh yeah out-of-band mechanisms

841
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,760
that help uh authentication of you know

842
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
devices that are different from our

843
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,480
traditional

844
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
big devices is obviously an important

845
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
topic as you mentioned there's you know

846
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,440
plenty of prior work from this eap

847
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,960
methods that we mentioned to many others

848
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
um

849
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
i also have happened to have worked a

850
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
little bit on the sensing space and

851
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,799
i sort of got the gut feeling at least

852
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,559
that it's

853
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
uh it's it's a little

854
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,360
far at the moment from like practical

855
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,880
application given that we don't actually

856
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,760
know

857
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,039
the details of accuracy and and so on so

858
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,320
it yeah

859
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
it may not be the first thing to to

860
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
focus on perhaps that that's that's my

861
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
gut feeling at least that some of the

862
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,279
other things are

863
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,039
more readily available and their

864
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,760
characteristics can be better

865
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,120
uh determined um i also think that your

866
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
security consideration section which was

867
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,480
pretty empty

868
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,079
probably need some considerations

869
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,719
because i'm i'm guessing there are some

870
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
some actual issues like how do you

871
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
how do you prove that yeah

872
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,639
there actually was something here and it

873
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,119
wasn't in some other place and

874
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,280
uh can someone simulate

875
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
you know one thing that looks like

876
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
another one and so on

877
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
so

878
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
yeah

879
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
but good good stuff um please keep

880
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,520
working on this

881
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,480
so if i understand you correctly you

882
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,839
think we should more uh focus on less

883
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,320
aspects as mentioned here especially on

884
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,159
the technology of the

885
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
sensing which is more future looking

886
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
right

887
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
yeah i i don't know if i'm right it's

888
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,800
just my gut feeling that the the using

889
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,480
sensing as the out-of-band channel is uh

890
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,960
yeah it's an interesting idea uh it may

891
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,119
not have immediate practical

892
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,880
applications given that the stuff is

893
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
still sort of in the works and we don't

894
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,800
really like we can't immediately

895
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
experiment with it whereas the some of

896
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,560
the other techniques are

897
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,680
more readily available

898
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,320
okay yeah yeah thank you as uh at least

899
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
we had in mind to be more general now so

900
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,440
not only focus on this sensing but on

901
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,119
also on the other methods which are

902
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
available still

903
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,280
the best of course would be to have some

904
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
overarching

905
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
concept which is working for everything

906
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,520
okay but everything is again too much

907
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,560
okay any other questions

908
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,799
sorry

909
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,480
well thank you thank you thank you

910
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,079
i'll select the next

911
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,560
presentation which i think is deft

912
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
okay can you hear me

913
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,200
um yeah we can do

914
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,598
okay

915
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,119
oh i found it

916
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
okay it was not going to happen

917
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,040
there we go

918
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,800
okay um all right so this draft is about

919
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,320
a new transport protocol and this isn't

920
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,560
a transfer service

921
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,680
um

922
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
are you comfortable turning on your

923
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
camera

924
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
i did turn it on it's on and it's

925
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
unshuttered and i have it's a count it

926
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,440
says the screen request and oh whoops

927
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,400
wrong thing sorry okay got it

928
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,599
okay

929
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,520
am i on now okay great okay so this is

930
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,240
not a transport protocol that is meant

931
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,280
to compete with tcp or quick

932
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,839
it's really meant for limited domains

933
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,200
like we encounter a lot in iot

934
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,839
so you know why would we do this so we

935
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,640
thought that there was a serious unmet

936
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
need that's very difficult if not

937
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,960
impossible to meet with

938
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,320
today's transport protocols so do i have

939
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
control of the slides or

940
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,359
next slide

941
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
okay so

942
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,960
we

943
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,760
um

944
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,720
we've already know that requiring device

945
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,760
enrollment is necessary to get security

946
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
in iot but it isn't sufficient and how

947
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
do we know this that lots of hackers

948
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,680
have kindly showed us this and if you

949
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
don't have any examples that you can

950
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
come up with there are three here that

951
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
you could follow the links for

952
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,000
later

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,560
so what can we do beyond enrollment can

954
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,520
i have the next slide

955
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,720
we also get from rfc 8520 that the

956
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,920
things that we use in iot have

957
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,000
restricted roles and they have rigid

958
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
communication constraints so if we could

959
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,839
enforce these

960
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,680
that could have prevented all of those

961
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
attacks so we have almost everything we

962
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,800
need to do that enforcement

963
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,560
so one thing we want to look at is this

964
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,280
notion that topic based pub sub is

965
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,839
usually used at the application layer in

966
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,960
iot

967
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
and if we could get that topic

968
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,839
visibility into the transport now the

969
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,119
transport could know what the

970
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,520
publication's intent was

971
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,680
now if we think about having pub sub in

972
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,480
the transport we have to secure that

973
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
that's going to require signing every

974
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
publication in order to have provenance

975
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
because we're not going to be thinking

976
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,079
about pipes between things

977
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,079
so if we could use that enrolled

978
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,400
identity as our signing certificate

979
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,960
we've already got some pieces we need

980
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,440
but what we want to do is use chain of

981
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,079
trust identities because now we can put

982
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,119
roles capabilities attributes whatever

983
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,920
we need to have can be in that chain

984
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
and if we have a shared route of trust

985
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
for everything it means that any of

986
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,960
these enrolled entities can go ahead and

987
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,400
validate any other members given the

988
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,760
right methodology so now every transport

989
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,640
instance would know who is saying what

990
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,040
and if it knows the rules it can enforce

991
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,000
them so this is what def does

992
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,040
connect the next slide

993
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,480
so

994
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
if we take this approach and this

995
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,040
approach is pushing pub sub into the

996
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,880
transport this is not mqtt now we get

997
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,280
some benefits that go beyond security

998
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,920
we're now communicating with topics at

999
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
the transport level instead of endpoints

1000
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,359
and this notion is inherently broadcast

1001
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,839
friendly so instead of having this you

1002
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,839
know pipe-based end-to-end type

1003
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,960
communication we're now order of n we

1004
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,040
don't need brokers or hubs so we

1005
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,119
eliminate a single point of failure

1006
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,599
attack and we don't need endpoint

1007
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,079
identities so we can just

1008
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,040
use link local self-assigned addresses

1009
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,359
we've been using ipv6

1010
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,079
and

1011
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,800
now security the whole security game

1012
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
completely changes from what we've been

1013
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,920
doing

1014
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,520
can i have the next slide

1015
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
so there's two big ideas that we're

1016
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,400
making use of in gift and the first one

1017
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,720
is that we're taking trust management

1018
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
that's

1019
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,480
how do we enforce those rules and we're

1020
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
integrating it into the transport

1021
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,440
and the second one that we're doing is

1022
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,319
we're embracing a broadcast physical

1023
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,800
layer by taking those topic-based

1024
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,359
collections at the transport so instead

1025
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,880
of a model where you've got an

1026
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,359
application level pub sub and a

1027
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,599
broadcast layer here and you're shoving

1028
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,000
everything into pipes in between we're

1029
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,880
just embracing this all the way through

1030
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,520
and desk uses trust schemas for the

1031
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
first one and set reconciliation for the

1032
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
second and both of these are relatively

1033
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
recent advances

1034
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,720
and each one of these could also be

1035
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,000
deployed

1036
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,640
separately from desk if you want in

1037
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
particularly the first could be deployed

1038
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,839
with application pub sub protocols like

1039
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,280
mqtt

1040
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,880
okay the next slide then

1041
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,359
so here's kind of the basics of defined

1042
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
trust communications

1043
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,400
is that we're going to always start with

1044
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,280
the configuration or bootstrap and just

1045
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
use any reasonable approach or a lot out

1046
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,560
there and this is how we do enrollment

1047
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,440
so enrollment is first necessary

1048
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,560
but now what we enroll with is a little

1049
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,800
bit more specific we have a bundle that

1050
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
contains the trust anchor for that

1051
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
particular trust domain a trust schema

1052
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,800
cert which is the rules compiled into a

1053
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,119
binary form and signed

1054
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,680
and then we have an identity which is

1055
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
the public search chain which is signed

1056
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
by the trust anchor at the top of the

1057
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,839
chain

1058
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,800
and your private signing key so the only

1059
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
thing there that needs to be kept secret

1060
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,040
is the private signing key

1061
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,440
so we're assuming locally generated

1062
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,160
trust anchors but this isn't required

1063
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,960
you could do this i suppose with

1064
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,000
non-locally generated trust anchors

1065
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
and our identities are distributed as

1066
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
chains of trust i hope that's the right

1067
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,560
plural for chain of trust and death

1068
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,200
contains the validation methods that

1069
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,119
check this signing chain

1070
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,839
and the chain is where we keep the roles

1071
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,960
the attributes and the capabilities

1072
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,319
can i see the next slide please

1073
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,880
so these rules can be really simple they

1074
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,200
don't have to you know tell you a lot

1075
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,280
about what each role can do

1076
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
you can you could make it as simple as

1077
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,359
just saying that an

1078
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,079
enrolled identity signs all the domain

1079
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,560
communications but you can certainly go

1080
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,920
beyond that to fairly fine-grained rules

1081
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,599
which is the kinds of things that we've

1082
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,520
been experimenting with

1083
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,000
and we have self-configuring privacy

1084
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,400
once you're enrolled via aead encryption

1085
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,359
and you can update the trust schemas

1086
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,520
at any time

1087
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,560
by

1088
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,880
changing the rules and you don't have to

1089
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,640
change your code so if you think about

1090
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,720
this you don't have to recompile code

1091
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
you just have to get a new trust schema

1092
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,680
in there

1093
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,359
and you could also

1094
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,599
take a trust schema not the binary

1095
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,079
version the text version and make minor

1096
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,400
changes like the trust anchor and

1097
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,560
recompile it and use it in a different

1098
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,839
deployment

1099
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,880
so i suspect pictures might be helpful

1100
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,560
kind of the next slide

1101
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,319
here's sort of a picture of what's going

1102
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,599
on and if you look in the upper um

1103
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,160
up at the top here we've got those trust

1104
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,240
requirements this is what's done

1105
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,440
offline

1106
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,960
what you want to do is you want to get

1107
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
your site policy and then you want to

1108
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,920
get rules that come from standards like

1109
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,839
what does a light bulb do what does a

1110
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,200
light switch do and we have very nice

1111
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,760
standards that lay those things out you

1112
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,880
put those together into trust rules in a

1113
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,400
in a particular format and then these go

1114
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,760
through a compiler which comes out with

1115
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,560
a binary version of the trust rules for

1116
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,359
a particular trust domain and then these

1117
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,079
are signed and put in a cert

1118
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,040
and

1119
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,119
now if we look at the part that's on the

1120
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,240
device

1121
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,040
most of it could be put into a trusted

1122
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,760
execution environment that's part of the

1123
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,040
construction

1124
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,359
so we've got the trust schema we've got

1125
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
portions that do the validation of

1126
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,839
publications and portions that build

1127
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,400
your publications and it's just the

1128
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
subscribe and publish that have to go

1129
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
through the call gates

1130
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,319
the shim that talks to the device that

1131
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,079
would be outside of the trusted

1132
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,000
execution environment and the shim is

1133
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,480
you know translating between what the

1134
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,720
device says in terms of

1135
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,800
you know i want to publish this or i

1136
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,760
want to

1137
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,400
to say this and i want to receive that

1138
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,040
it's going to translate between the

1139
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
publications

1140
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
both ways between the device and the

1141
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,560
publication so now what happens is

1142
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,880
we've set this up say so that the light

1143
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,240
bulb can only report its status all it

1144
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,520
can do is say i'm on or i'm off i mean

1145
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,200
obviously you could have different

1146
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,640
levels of on

1147
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,839
but

1148
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,760
now if somebody

1149
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,839
puts something in that firmware that

1150
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,040
allows them to say activate a microphone

1151
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,880
that happened to be on the chip in the

1152
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,079
light bulb

1153
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
there's no way for that to talk to the

1154
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,880
outside world because that publication

1155
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,119
would be rejected it doesn't fit the

1156
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,040
trust schema it doesn't fit the trust

1157
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
rules it's out of here

1158
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,680
similarly if somebody tries to send

1159
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,000
something that it doesn't fit the trust

1160
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,560
rules we reject that as soon as possible

1161
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,920
coming in from the network

1162
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
now let's see the next slide

1163
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,079
on the next slide i want to

1164
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,920
go back to what we were saying in the

1165
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,319
beginning about enrollment not being

1166
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,520
sufficient

1167
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,079
so here's what we do right step one we

1168
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,640
enroll that light bulb just in a way you

1169
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,119
do now except that we use that bundle

1170
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,280
that i described earlier

1171
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,079
in step two that enrolled light bulb is

1172
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,400
going to join the trust domain and it

1173
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,560
doesn't need any external servers or

1174
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,720
routers it doesn't need to know who's

1175
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,800
already in the domain and the things

1176
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,880
that are in the domain already don't

1177
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,720
need to know anything about the light

1178
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,680
bulb

1179
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,280
so the light bulb comes in by saying

1180
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,880
i want to i publish my identity to the

1181
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,359
cert collection for this domain and i

1182
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,319
subscribe to get everyone else's

1183
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,319
and what's happening over here is we

1184
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,960
have a device that's our key maker and

1185
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,119
it has to be something that's always on

1186
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,599
and this particular device won the

1187
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,440
keymaker election

1188
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,000
and it's going to get this new

1189
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,480
um this new cert that was published in

1190
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,240
the collection which is a light bulb

1191
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,359
cert and it's going to now encrypt the

1192
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,040
aead key and stick it you know and stick

1193
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
it out in that collection so that the

1194
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,720
light bulb can get it

1195
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
so the light bulb has subscribed to that

1196
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,240
collection now it gets the aead key

1197
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,440
and it's now able to publish it can

1198
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,920
subscribe to the publications and it can

1199
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
publish and away it goes

1200
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,480
but keep in mind that what it can do is

1201
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,400
listen to those

1202
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,160
publications and they can listen to

1203
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,559
things that has its specific name

1204
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
um maybe it's the kitchen sink light or

1205
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,920
it can listen to the room that it's in

1206
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,640
kitchen lights or it can be

1207
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,960
everything on the ground floor or every

1208
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,640
light in the house

1209
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
but that light can only report its

1210
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,920
status and it can't issue any commands

1211
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,400
so that takes care of that light bulb

1212
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,960
hack that was back on the earlier slide

1213
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,040
that was the

1214
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,119
checkpoint published on that a couple of

1215
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,880
years ago

1216
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,160
so can i have the next slide

1217
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,359
so this is sort of my final notes that

1218
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,200
our goal for this draft is an

1219
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,359
independent submission

1220
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,920
informational rfc but we're really

1221
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,800
looking for feedback on the draft to

1222
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,280
include it i mean it's just been a small

1223
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,520
number of us working on this and it's

1224
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
just good to find out what we may have

1225
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,720
missed and

1226
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,440
what other things could be important

1227
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,839
possibly looking for collaborators on

1228
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,480
defined trust communications but i'm not

1229
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,240
sure what that would look like but if

1230
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,800
somebody has an idea let me know

1231
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
and the other thing we wanted to do is

1232
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,880
expose some of these new ideas about

1233
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,800
transport and security because we

1234
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,400
thought they might be useful in other

1235
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,599
ietf work and this work is completely

1236
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,520
open we have a

1237
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,839
open source reference implementation

1238
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,359
that that also has tools for

1239
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,000
looking at what you're working on and

1240
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,319
also you know examining trust schemas

1241
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,480
and has some examples

1242
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,200
bug reports are welcome uh we might be

1243
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,040
slow to respond that doesn't mean we

1244
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
don't love to hear from you we just are

1245
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,640
slow and

1246
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,240
um as i say it's open you should feel uh

1247
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,800
free to cannibalize parts of it for

1248
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,280
something else if it's useful in some

1249
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,400
way and that's basically why we're here

1250
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,280
so

1251
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,680
question

1252
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,920
yeah there's already one hand in the air

1253
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,720
so to speak dave that's first

1254
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,800
hello dave taylor um so i i have not yet

1255
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,720
read the draft so thank you for this

1256
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,079
presentation since i didn't know about

1257
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,400
this before but this is uh looks great

1258
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,079
um meaning a couple things that i really

1259
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,680
like about this if i understand right

1260
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,440
you're using a trusted execution

1261
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,319
environment or your slideshow trust zone

1262
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,880
and so the use of tees and iot is

1263
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,558
i just lost the sound did

1264
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,559
so

1265
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
okay

1266
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
yeah so what we seem to have here is a

1267
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,480
network partition so we can hear

1268
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,359
ourselves here on the internet side but

1269
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,920
the room is gone

1270
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,960
i have

1271
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,640
messaged hank through a back channel to

1272
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
let him know what's going on but i don't

1273
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,400
know

1274
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,640
if he will respond or not

1275
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,280
um okay so i stopped hearing anything

1276
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,920
after he started to mention the trusted

1277
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,400
execution environment use and just

1278
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,040
barely mentioned that on iot devices

1279
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,640
yeah yeah yes

1280
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,319
i mean yeah the state of the art today

1281
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,200
there aren't a lot of uh tees on iot

1282
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,960
devices i think is what he was trying to

1283
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,319
say

1284
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,400
right well we're not you don't we're not

1285
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,040
we don't actually require that um i

1286
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,440
think that that was meant to show how

1287
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,920
you could really get

1288
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,720
extra security here and

1289
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,359
we're a little less concerned with you

1290
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,680
know today state of the art the kind of

1291
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,079
thing that that mud was really meant to

1292
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,200
deal with and kind of going forward and

1293
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,000
some of the more special

1294
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,640
purpose uses you know one of the

1295
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,280
collaborators here is operant and you

1296
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,000
know

1297
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,079
they can use trusted execution

1298
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,599
environments and the things that they're

1299
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,960
rolling up right so

1300
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,400
sorry i don't know where he was going

1301
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,640
from there so i can't really see you

1302
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,760
yeah yeah

1303
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,440
i don't i don't know either but i just

1304
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,319
want to make that clear that um we don't

1305
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,359
require them and it's just that if you

1306
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,200
really want to harden your security

1307
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,880
and i think if you did read the draft

1308
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,559
you can kind of see we're not really

1309
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,559
requiring it we mentioned that as a way

1310
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,640
to deal with

1311
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,960
some possible security

1312
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,240
issues

1313
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,280
and you know we clearly we think that's

1314
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,839
a good place to go going forward because

1315
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,839
the world's just going to get

1316
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,040
um

1317
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,640
you know nastier in terms of attacking

1318
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,720
[Laughter]

1319
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,480
dave might have to repeat some of his

1320
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,400
questions maybe all of it yeah and maybe

1321
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,160
we will set the discussion from here

1322
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,880
yeah go for all of it here yeah

1323
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,960
okay so i'm gonna back up to just uh

1324
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,240
comments and then i actually have two

1325
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,319
technical questions uh or maybe two

1326
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,640
halves the same thing question uh the

1327
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
comments were about uh the things that i

1328
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,720
really liked on your presentation

1329
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,480
was that you were using a trusted

1330
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,680
execution environment right you showed

1331
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,920
trust zone on your slide in iot and i

1332
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,400
wish more people would do that uh use uh

1333
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,680
tees

1334
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,559
um

1335
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,240
the since you mentioned it was open

1336
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,839
source and that you wanted additional

1337
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:08,799
review

1338
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,960
my suggestion was you might take this to

1339
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,640
the conference computing consortium and

1340
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,160
present it in the technical advisory

1341
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,440
council meeting

1342
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,280
um by the way i chair that meeting so i

1343
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,559
can make sure you get on the agenda and

1344
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,920
a couple people in this room are the

1345
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,599
typical attendees

1346
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,079
um but that organization

1347
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,079
sponsors open source projects and since

1348
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,200
you have one

1349
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,640
um they would be very interested in

1350
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,480
hearing about use of tees and

1351
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,760
environments and i think this would be

1352
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
very appropriate so anyway that was my

1353
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,440
ccc

1354
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,520
all right i will email you later to get

1355
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,040
more information maybe okay yeah great

1356
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,160
um

1357
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,319
then one of my technical questions

1358
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,760
um because you mentioned you know what's

1359
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,280
missing or what didn't you talk about

1360
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
that may or may not be in the draft i

1361
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,280
don't know but the first one is uh

1362
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,880
there's a number of iot devices that

1363
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,799
roam around at different networks like

1364
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,319
things that i carry on me

1365
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,400
so how do you know the first question is

1366
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,839
how do you know that you're actually in

1367
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,280
the limited domain

1368
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,359
versus somewhere else okay that was the

1369
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,599
first question and the second question

1370
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,760
is how do you actually do discovery and

1371
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
setup usually in a transport protocol

1372
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,240
i mean are using dns or do you have some

1373
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,160
discovery mechanism and how do you know

1374
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,839
that the discovery mechanism isn't going

1375
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,599
on and then the non-limited domain and

1376
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,960
so on so those are the topics that i was

1377
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,400
more interested in hearing more about so

1378
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,280
okay um so i want to um

1379
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,359
let's see what was the first part of the

1380
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,480
question

1381
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,640
the first question was if i have say two

1382
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,960
devices that are both right roaming

1383
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,000
airport

1384
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,839
can they still talk to each other

1385
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,440
because they're both my devices but i'm

1386
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,559
in the airport instead of on my home

1387
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,000
network

1388
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
yes so

1389
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,040
we have

1390
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,680
we we aren't that's not so much our

1391
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,920
problem space right now but we do have a

1392
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,880
problem space where we connect um

1393
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,920
different

1394
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,799
trust domains or we're sort of extending

1395
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,559
them by putting them over something like

1396
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,079
a udp or tcp connection and i believe

1397
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,599
there's some stuff about that in the

1398
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,319
draft and there is an example out there

1399
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,599
and i we hope eventually we have some

1400
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,799
ideas about like roaming around within

1401
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,839
a a building where within a trust domain

1402
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,040
where we can sort of mesh devices and i

1403
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,960
think a little bit of that is in the

1404
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,440
draft and i have to say that's more our

1405
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,359
stuff is kind of on the edge here we're

1406
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,480
still working with that but um so far

1407
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,079
we're kind of encouraged i've got a

1408
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,319
couple little examples i've been trying

1409
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,359
on that

1410
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,720
um but in terms of true mobility of you

1411
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,640
know you carrying your device like i

1412
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,079
said to the airport and everything

1413
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,440
that's something we'll have to think

1414
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,880
about

1415
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,440
i think that we have a lot of the tools

1416
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,079
to do it as to the other it would be

1417
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,559
really nice if van would answer this

1418
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,880
because he can you know sort of use all

1419
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,960
the lingo right and he should be

1420
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,799
somewhere there uh then could you

1421
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,200
answer the stuff about how we're kind of

1422
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,880
making use of

1423
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,000
what's in the link local ipv6 but we're

1424
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,359
not using

1425
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,920
dns or anything we're

1426
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,079
it

1427
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,000
yeah

1428
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,240
okay

1429
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,520
we i dave

1430
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,040
long time no see

1431
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,240
uh

1432
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,319
we're using uh

1433
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,960
ip6 multicast for

1434
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,079
rendezvous because it's

1435
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,960
defined uh to have exactly the semantic

1436
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,839
we want it's link local

1437
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,680
self-assigned addresses

1438
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,559
guaranteed not to loop

1439
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,319
and so

1440
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,799
because it's a very multicast friendly

1441
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,160
transport

1442
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,839
we

1443
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,280
simply advertise

1444
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,920
in the appropriate topic that we have

1445
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,559
this information if you know something

1446
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,640
that your peers don't

1447
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,599
uh

1448
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,040
you give it to them if they know

1449
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,559
something that you don't they give it to

1450
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:03,520
you

1451
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,640
uh and so everybody reconciles their

1452
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,079
collections

1453
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,680
learns what they need to know and as

1454
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,200
cathay went through

1455
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,960
first you do it for search so you've got

1456
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,799
everybody's identity

1457
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,240
then you do it for the

1458
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,599
trust zone's

1459
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,559
current

1460
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,520
non-privacy key and now you can start to

1461
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,640
publish uh

1462
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,319
publications based on

1463
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,359
the rules which because you're all in

1464
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,799
of that

1465
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,000
should have mentioned that the

1466
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,480
address that's used

1467
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,400
includes

1468
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,200
the

1469
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,839
trust zone

1470
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,680
identifier

1471
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,480
it

1472
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,559
trust domain guarantee that everybody

1473
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,040
follows the same rules by

1474
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,760
the communication prefix is basically

1475
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,400
the hash of the signing key of the

1476
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,079
of the trust zone certificate of the

1477
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,760
rules so

1478
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,000
so you're guaranteed to

1479
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,079
be talking about things that everybody

1480
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,960
agrees on their meaning

1481
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,040
great thank you van

1482
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,880
as i understand it if i understand the

1483
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,680
the the the overall answer to my

1484
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,880
question thank you for the details by

1485
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,200
the way um that the

1486
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,920
pr that the protocol itself def does its

1487
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,440
own discovery it doesn't rely on some

1488
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,520
external mechanism like dns or mbns or

1489
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,000
something like that okay

1490
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,280
i don't know how much time we have if i

1491
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,040
have time for a follow-up question or oh

1492
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,160
the other enough time there is okay uh

1493
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,119
so

1494
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,280
follow-up question which may just relate

1495
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,799
to the first question that i ask is how

1496
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:41,839
do you know that you're in the limited

1497
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,520
domain

1498
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,440
is across different ways of doing

1499
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,160
discovery when you have uh

1500
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,760
privacy information

1501
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,319
do you consider as being within the

1502
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,799
threat model and you consider the case

1503
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,559
where the

1504
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,640
network itself is untrusted in other

1505
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,400
words where you have say two entities

1506
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,480
that need to discover each other without

1507
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,760
revealing that they're part of the same

1508
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,839
trust domain on an on an untrusted

1509
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,599
network is that part of the threat model

1510
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,720
or are not part of the threat model

1511
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,680
we can run on an untrusted

1512
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,000
network and then you can jump in here if

1513
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,200
you want to but we haven't considered

1514
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,240
like trying to hide the fact that

1515
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,599
we're in the domain because um

1516
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,359
you know we're hoping that what we're

1517
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,280
putting together here is good enough

1518
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,920
security and as van pointed out sort of

1519
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,359
this detail but um when we publish we

1520
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,359
you know and that it kind of shows which

1521
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,280
the

1522
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,920
which trust domain you're part of and i

1523
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,480
think that's um you know that kind of

1524
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,119
helps you find each other and what

1525
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,400
you're doing is um you know publishing

1526
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
your certificates and if you were to

1527
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,960
publish your certificate this is maybe

1528
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,680
another detail but and you never see it

1529
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,440
show up in the collection which

1530
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,000
basically means no one else is there to

1531
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
get it then you would you know

1532
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,319
presumably eventually give up you know

1533
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,319
up call to the application because that

1534
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,359
just means

1535
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,559
there's nobody else here in your um

1536
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,640
or maybe periodically try again

1537
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,760
so yeah i can explain why i'm asking the

1538
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,280
questions just whether there's other

1539
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,960
work that would be applicable to your

1540
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,520
use case or not within the space of say

1541
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,760
the md s domain i know you're not using

1542
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,599
that right but there was work there that

1543
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,799
said if i have two devices uh you're in

1544
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,720
the airport on an untrusted network can

1545
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,160
they discover each other without

1546
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,400
revealing the fact that they uh are in

1547
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,160
the same

1548
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,520
how do they discover each other without

1549
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,039
revealing the fact that they're that

1550
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,640
it's like my devices or whatever where

1551
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,039
typically like in tls one side reveals a

1552
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,280
certificate and the other side does not

1553
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,960
right and so you have to publish the

1554
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,559
fact that you're there and so there's

1555
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,720
actually work that keeps perfect secrecy

1556
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,839
on both sides and still allowing

1557
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,520
discovery and that work was done in the

1558
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,200
context of mdns

1559
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,799
if you care about that in your trust

1560
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,799
model then you might be able to have

1561
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,200
similar uh approaches and just steal

1562
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,960
them from the other uh protocol work

1563
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,559
that was done i think it might be an rfc

1564
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,240
now i don't know but it started like

1565
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,520
five years ago or something

1566
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,079
yeah it didn't progress okay you uh well

1567
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,520
christian started it but then somebody

1568
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,440
else that was a researcher and then uh

1569
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,880
took it over from there i just know

1570
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,640
there's a body of work that says if you

1571
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,319
care about that trust model or that

1572
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,400
threat model then there's a body of work

1573
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,200
for how to do um uh that you know

1574
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,119
oblivious discovery if you will on an

1575
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,960
untrusted network so you may or may not

1576
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,640
care but that was part of the follow-up

1577
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,640
on the airport question so

1578
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,640
okay well there's nothing you're really

1579
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,880
you're not sort of saying um this is

1580
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
dave saylor's phone right you're just

1581
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,119
putting out the cert right you're

1582
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,960
broadcasting it so i don't know what

1583
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
you're saying oh yes we haven't right

1584
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,920
yeah

1585
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,359
yeah

1586
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,920
correct if you say i'm looking for

1587
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,520
anybody else that's in dave flailer's

1588
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,720
domain without saying that it's dave

1589
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,640
sailor's domain right um

1590
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,120
part of that is we we include the

1591
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,039
[Music]

1592
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,520
trust schema hash

1593
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,720
in the ip6 multicast address

1594
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,680
so

1595
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,640
uh

1596
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,520
you're rendezvouing on something that

1597
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,440
has

1598
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,920
extremely limited distribution right

1599
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,400
it's a cert that you made up at home

1600
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,920
and

1601
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,880
that

1602
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,839
to the extent that the domain supports

1603
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,280
ip6 multicast then

1604
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,559
you can

1605
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,960
do the selective rendezvous

1606
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,079
uh

1607
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,119
and then

1608
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,440
pure authentication so

1609
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,039
some sort of challenge response if you

1610
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,960
you want to validate it

1611
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,119
uh

1612
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,799
so

1613
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,160
uh

1614
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,640
look at this but uh

1615
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,240
uh

1616
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,039
having this large

1617
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,720
uh multi-cat

1618
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,440
having a broadcast rendezvous and then a

1619
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,200
large address space that you can play

1620
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,319
with to

1621
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,200
filter the rendezvous is a big help

1622
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,520
yeah i agree having a

1623
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,200
a

1624
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,920
multicast group that uh is you know a

1625
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,079
hash of some security credential that

1626
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,359
you know you're rendezvouing on a

1627
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,880
multicast group out of a very large

1628
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,640
space actually uh helps the problem

1629
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,400
significantly yeah that makes sense so

1630
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,839
all right i see brennan is in queue

1631
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,119
thank you for letting me ask you a bunch

1632
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,880
of questions uh i find this really

1633
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,160
interesting would love to see this

1634
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,160
presented into the uh confidential

1635
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,359
computing consortium so thank you

1636
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,839
by the way this has been really fun to

1637
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,200
work on i have to say that

1638
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,839
happy to hear that then before brent

1639
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,440
before you step in line i just want to

1640
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,880
pay from

1641
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,359
point some attention to some remarks on

1642
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,319
the

1643
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,119
chat

1644
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,119
which is i think from carson who

1645
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,119
mentions oh that's a secret handshake

1646
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,559
problem again and

1647
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,680
you might need unlinkability

1648
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,079
so uh these are comments that you can of

1649
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,559
course discuss on uh the iot ops list or

1650
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,119
directly with proponents here uh sorry

1651
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,640
contributors here

1652
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,680
so um

1653
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,599
yeah so the the point about

1654
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,960
unlinkability was simply that

1655
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,039
the fact that that you cannot make

1656
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,559
anything out of the

1657
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,799
trust schema hash

1658
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,599
is not the whole solution because you

1659
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,839
still can link

1660
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,559
transmissions of that hash

1661
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,559
so you actually have to protect that

1662
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:35,760
hash

1663
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,960
in in such a way that that only

1664
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,440
um authorized people actually can find

1665
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,680
that hash and unauthorized people have

1666
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,039
no idea what's going on cannot

1667
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,200
distinguish the transmission

1668
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,240
from random bits

1669
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,520
i guess i'd have to know what the

1670
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,119
exposure

1671
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,119
is

1672
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,920
if things are

1673
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,720
um

1674
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,920
private

1675
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,240
i mean

1676
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,720
i i'm probably not understanding the

1677
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,039
question i guess i'm not sure what the

1678
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,000
exposure is if somebody else knows

1679
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,799
well if

1680
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,480
if i always find this particular

1681
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,440
trustschema hash at the airport

1682
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,680
at a particular point in time i know the

1683
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
same person is there again

1684
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,920
so that's the linkability

1685
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,079
issue and we have to do something about

1686
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,839
link link ability

1687
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:34,799
of

1688
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,520
transmissions

1689
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,720
um i don't know if dan has anything to

1690
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,520
say about this i would just say um

1691
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,359
yeah we hadn't

1692
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,160
we hadn't thought about this so much for

1693
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,119
the um you know if you're going to the

1694
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,200
airport type thing you know that you're

1695
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,680
moving around and the mobility

1696
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,920
that may you know when you're trying to

1697
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,160
find out the patterns of the person

1698
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,640
who's using that particular

1699
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,160
trust domain

1700
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,240
uh that had that really wasn't our

1701
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,160
initial use case

1702
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,480
there might be things or extensions that

1703
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,359
one could could do as i said this is

1704
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,280
open and

1705
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,880
you know if there's another use case

1706
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
that might be able to take make use of

1707
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,198
some of this that would be great but van

1708
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,559
might have something else to say

1709
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,920
thank you okay sorry moving on to

1710
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,399
brandon

1711
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,120
this threat can be a discussion can be

1712
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,960
continued on the list most certainly but

1713
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,560
i want to give bretton there's my time

1714
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,238
so um i think that you may be focusing

1715
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,000
too much and carsten even may be

1716
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,399
focusing too much on the unlinkability

1717
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,479
problem uh because there's actually a

1718
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,880
bigger one that shows up first and

1719
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,040
that's simply traffic analysis if you

1720
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,439
have communication partners in a

1721
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,399
untrusted domain then you can link them

1722
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,640
regardless of discovery simply by

1723
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,198
monitoring their traffic and seeing uh

1724
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,960
challenge response patterns and things

1725
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,198
like that so it doesn't take much

1726
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,920
analysis to discover that unless you've

1727
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,080
got an extremely noisy network that uh

1728
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,520
prevents you from doing statistical

1729
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,839
analysis on the responses of devices uh

1730
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,839
and that i think is going to be

1731
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,520
something that you have to consider if

1732
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,359
you actually want to

1733
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,319
make it visible or or sorry make it

1734
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,319
invisible that two devices are talking

1735
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,359
to each other um the the handshake is

1736
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,520
only the first step and if you can't

1737
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,279
solve the second one then solving a

1738
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,198
handshake doesn't really matter

1739
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,319
and

1740
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,799
the the other aspect to this is that

1741
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,000
you're going to need to deal with the

1742
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,880
stalker problem so if you have someone

1743
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,359
who visits a coffee shop once in a while

1744
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,960
and they're carrying their device that's

1745
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,520
proudly announcing itself at the coffee

1746
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,080
shop that tells everyone who's listening

1747
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,239
with a directional antenna or whatever

1748
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,520
um that they're there and if you don't

1749
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,120
want that

1750
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
then you need to have something that's

1751
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,400
more than a hash of a trust domain

1752
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,080
because that's simply going to announce

1753
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
the presence of an individual wherever

1754
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,040
they go and that may be not something

1755
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,400
you're looking for because you are

1756
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,920
creating a surveillance vehicle

1757
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,159
it doesn't announce the president the

1758
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,440
individual right it announces um

1759
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,640
but

1760
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,880
it announces someone that is using that

1761
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,679
trust domain so if the trustee means

1762
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,239
what you're unique to an individual then

1763
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,840
it becomes a unique they are not unique

1764
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,159
to an individual they're they're unique

1765
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,239
to a trust domain

1766
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,280
are trust domains unique to individuals

1767
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,320
no i mean they could be if you had i

1768
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,560
guess but you i mean

1769
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,840
that's not the trust domain would be

1770
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,320
for example you know maybe an entire

1771
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,560
factory or um

1772
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,360
so all of the devices that are in it are

1773
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,120
in that trust domain

1774
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,040
and

1775
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,000
when things publish they

1776
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,239
i mean you know you're talking about two

1777
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,159
devices

1778
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,239
communicating and we don't really think

1779
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,400
so much in that terms everything gets

1780
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,719
broadcast right so i guess if there's

1781
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,159
only two devices you will see only two

1782
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,440
devices

1783
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,280
lighting up with that

1784
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,880
um trust domain as their you know

1785
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,000
starting

1786
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,760
bits but

1787
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,400
if there are multiple devices what

1788
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,719
you're going to see is it might be

1789
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:35,760
somewhat

1790
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,040
random

1791
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,960
who is responding when you know someone

1792
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,360
is sending out something that's you know

1793
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,520
kind of looking for more information or

1794
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,280
more publications

1795
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,080
no indeed i appreciate that um sorry i

1796
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,760
just uh from some of the previous

1797
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,440
discussion i had gotten the impression

1798
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,679
that uh trust and means could be

1799
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,000
personally unique there was a comment

1800
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,840
earlier that it was made in a very

1801
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
limited scope for example and from that

1802
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,040
basis then you can see how that would be

1803
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,679
a surveillance vehicle um so the the

1804
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,000
point here is definitely do not make

1805
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,199
individual

1806
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,760
scoped trust domains because that

1807
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,440
constructs a surveillance vehicle

1808
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,840
i think that would tend to apply to to

1809
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,640
your use case right like the if if your

1810
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,280
use case has a lot of mobility to it

1811
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,199
then there are probably different things

1812
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,000
or techniques that we would want to use

1813
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,800
and

1814
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,760
i think if what you're doing is being

1815
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,800
you know if it's a factory for example

1816
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,159
maybe you don't need to change your

1817
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,960
trust domain often but there's no reason

1818
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,760
that you couldn't change that a lot if

1819
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,360
it was just being used for a very small

1820
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,679
scope that the individual was talking

1821
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,120
back to their home and they're moving

1822
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
around and you're worrying about being

1823
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,000
tracked they can change the

1824
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,120
their trust domain frequently that

1825
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
you know that they could

1826
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,239
that could be done it's just it doesn't

1827
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,080
it isn't something we worried about for

1828
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,800
our use cases but you know i kind of

1829
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,640
hear what everybody's going to hear is

1830
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,120
going right to mobility and what occurs

1831
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,920
to me is you know maybe you would just

1832
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,400
um you know change it

1833
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,760
okay

1834
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,239
i just wanted to raise it so thank you

1835
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,719
let me launch in here um in the interest

1836
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,520
of time actually we have some time but

1837
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,120
when is uh

1838
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,960
in a close queue when do you have some

1839
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,600
important or is it could you do this on

1840
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,000
the list

1841
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,360
if you could do it on the list you could

1842
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,800
lower your hand

1843
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,520
otherwise i yeah yes i'm trying to lower

1844
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,360
my hand i can do it

1845
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,360
okay okay

1846
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,159
okay so um two things um have you spoken

1847
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:58,879
to elliot yeah i see dice um

1848
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,440
just briefly we've exchanged a couple of

1849
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,800
emails

1850
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,719
okay good that that's excellent also

1851
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,719
what i just heard could be a security

1852
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,560
considerations content

1853
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,320
so if you scope your trust domain too

1854
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,679
small it might be a problem so um so

1855
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,920
what you just discussed with brenton the

1856
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,760
um the uh what would say the

1857
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,360
surveillance systems you might be

1858
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,840
involuntarily just reconstructing there

1859
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,920
that is probably a part that could be

1860
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,840
discussed in the uh security

1861
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,360
consideration part of the document

1862
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,600
so just um

1863
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,199
yeah i want to ask are there more

1864
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,960
questions but unfortunately the time is

1865
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,880
a little bit short now um so thank you

1866
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,120
for your presentation

1867
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,080
um okay pleasure um yeah thanks for

1868
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,400
letting me present

1869
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,080
you're welcome

1870
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,360
um let me quickly oh i'm sharing nothing

1871
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,239
i see

1872
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,199
unlock the queue first

1873
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,840
and we will go to our next presentation

1874
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,120
oh there it is okay

1875
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,600
and here again

1876
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,719
and the floor is yours

1877
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,560
i'm not sure if i have

1878
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,800
yeah i have one mike

1879
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,560
hello again

1880
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,640
thank you very much uh again hack for

1881
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,360
for the space for presenting uh a bit

1882
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,239
more about uh the draft issue so i have

1883
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,280
made one one short presentation in the

1884
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,600
uh awp uh

1885
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,960
session and

1886
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,120
during the morning and now i'm going to

1887
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,640
present uh some some results of

1888
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,280
on running good tests that i may do

1889
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,239
during my research my research phase

1890
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,159
while i was uh

1891
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,760
producing this

1892
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,360
this draft so next slide please

1893
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,519
sorry on it

1894
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,040
so this is the agenda i'm going to

1895
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,120
introduce you about

1896
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,280
what i'd like you to call in vitro

1897
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,120
experiment it was one

1898
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,840
so much specific environment that we

1899
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,400
have developed uh

1900
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,600
with a running code test with issue uh

1901
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,719
i'm gonna show you the experimentation

1902
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,640
and uh

1903
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,840
i will open some some space to excuse

1904
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,159
uh a bit more about some other domains i

1905
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,600
have the domains that

1906
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,040
maybe could

1907
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,400
explain the concepts of history and then

1908
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,320
talk a bit more about the next steps

1909
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,120
next slide please

1910
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,040
so this is the basic environment of the

1911
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,159
experiment that we have run so we

1912
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,560
simulated one

1913
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,239
home iot network

1914
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,520
and i

1915
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,719
attacked this network with one

1916
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,400
mirai variant

1917
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,760
where the basic change that we made was

1918
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,600
uh

1919
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,120
the the cnc c7 the the

1920
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,080
reporting scanning report server and

1921
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,520
also the the

1922
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,040
infection server all all of them in the

1923
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,960
edge node

1924
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,560
that would be more uh

1925
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,640
can exploit more than the graphics

1926
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,520
allowed by mud so

1927
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,040
uh

1928
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,679
we have simulated this this environment

1929
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,920
and then we used

1930
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,000
112

1931
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,960
simulated devices iot devices by running

1932
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,520
docker busy box images with a

1933
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,800
a vulnerable donut server vulnerable to

1934
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,440
mirai and well we have

1935
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,400
built a network communication graph

1936
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,239
uh by using the the mod files the 28 mod

1937
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,280
files

1938
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,040
provided by magic from the

1939
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,920
university of south wales so we have

1940
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,400
basically four replicas

1941
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,440
from each modifier that was uh

1942
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,960
was

1943
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,000
uh describe it there uh published that

1944
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,360
and we use it in my right variant

1945
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,679
and in like the next slide we start to

1946
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,280
excuse

1947
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,880
uh the results

1948
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,920
for next slide please

1949
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,880
well we basically uh

1950
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,560
have had the measurement of uh

1951
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,000
five basic uh metrics the number of the

1952
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,199
number of the the dos packets generated

1953
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,600
transmitted and also the number of

1954
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,679
bought that bots that could communicate

1955
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,719
with the command and control server the

1956
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,159
number of bots that could that was uh

1957
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,960
scanned and reported to the reporting 7

1958
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,280
server and the number of new infection

1959
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,679
after the starting of the scenarios and

1960
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,440
they had uh

1961
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,679
different uh scenarios

1962
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,440
also

1963
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,560
with all iot devices infected with

1964
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,679
with the original infected from

1965
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,440
two scenarios where

1966
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,840
different kinds of iot devices infected

1967
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,800
inside the network and they run during

1968
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,040
20 minutes uh this uh this experiment in

1969
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,280
three kinds of protection in the same

1970
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,360
network the natural equipment

1971
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,920
non-protection the network it and the

1972
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,400
protection provided by mud itself the

1973
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,760
rfc 8520 and the protection provided by

1974
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,719
by issue so we can see in the left most

1975
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,040
for example the worst enough scenario

1976
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:39,920
where

1977
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,719
they it was possible with all the

1978
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,920
devices and the network infected in one

1979
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,560
in one network with no protection

1980
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,320
so we in

1981
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,040
about 20 minutes and

1982
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,640
even

1983
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,520
i think that it was uh

1984
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,719
five or four rounds of of the attacks we

1985
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:01,520
had

1986
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,239
uh something between 2.5 and 3 millions

1987
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,400
of packets generated and transmitted by

1988
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,560
the network in the network with known

1989
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,920
protection

1990
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,400
and in in the case of in the same

1991
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,440
scenario

1992
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,880
with

1993
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,880
with the protection of mud we had

1994
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,239
a little less

1995
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,040
than

1996
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,880
1.5 million

1997
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,440
packets generated but almost

1998
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,679
non-transmitted because what

1999
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:32,320
has a good protection uh

2000
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,280
of

2001
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,560
impacts

2002
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,360
of

2003
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,320
communication uh with whole sites

2004
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,480
outside my internal network

2005
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,719
so we had a high number of

2006
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,880
of packet generated but almost

2007
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,639
non-transmitted we have some of those

2008
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,199
scenarios but if you look at the uh

2009
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,840
rightmost side of the of the of this

2010
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,000
chart we will see all the scenarios

2011
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,560
where where we use it issue so we

2012
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,600
could not identify uh any generation or

2013
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,600
transmission of the dust packets in the

2014
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,920
scenario that they have experiment

2015
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,080
experimented so next slide please

2016
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,480
and in this in this

2017
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,199
chart we see the number of controllable

2018
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,719
boards and

2019
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,679
limit fractions and scanned nodes

2020
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,600
and we see basically why we had uh

2021
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,679
some of that numbers or some of those

2022
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,159
numbers where

2023
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,120
in the left most uh part we can see that

2024
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,040
all the bots uh

2025
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,400
in the network

2026
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,280
uh

2027
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,600
without any protection could

2028
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
connect to the command and control of

2029
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,920
nura.net and the is in a similar manner

2030
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,120
we can see that mods still allowed

2031
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,560
uh some

2032
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,560
some devices 40 devices from the

2033
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:58,080
112 devices uh

2034
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,639
could connect to the to the

2035
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,280
permanent control server

2036
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,239
and then could generate the dust traffic

2037
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:10,080
but the the the older metrics like the

2038
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,280
refraction and scanning was smaller and

2039
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,960
much nerve but in issue we did not have

2040
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,199
any ddos packet uh generated because

2041
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,560
none of the bots

2042
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,040
could be controlled uh even when

2043
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,480
infected we did not have any uh

2044
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,280
any new infection and also it did not

2045
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,639
have uh

2046
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,600
navy scanning and so on so

2047
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,440
basically in the

2048
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,600
specific scenario that we tested you

2049
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,760
should block it all that all the

2050
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,719
operation traffic of the blu-ray dot net

2051
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,280
so this is basically what we have during

2052
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,080
our

2053
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,199
experiment

2054
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,480
uh

2055
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,760
next slide twice actually

2056
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,600
i'm not gonna use this one so next

2057
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,920
please

2058
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,159
okay so

2059
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:05,600
besides the the home iot scenario we are

2060
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,920
also studying some other scenarios to

2061
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,520
expand the issue proposal so the first

2062
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,760
one uh that we are thinking about

2063
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,480
throughout also with we tissue is in the

2064
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,320
scenario of

2065
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,520
smart cities where we have similar

2066
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,920
topologies and and there are unity of

2067
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,920
devices we have

2068
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,360
the same scenario

2069
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,840
with a small stock

2070
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,400
taking care of big infrastructures

2071
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,280
and

2072
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,719
well

2073
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,719
different from the home home iot

2074
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,760
scenario in smart cities we can consider

2075
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,480
that we understand better

2076
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,320
the running applications we can

2077
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,600
understand better the running

2078
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,679
applications inside my network and that

2079
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,840
we also have more computer power

2080
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,040
available

2081
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,600
uh and a second branch of of this

2082
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,480
proposal of this dispute often shoe

2083
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,280
is through running it all off in

2084
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,760
industrial loyalty we are running on one

2085
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,320
research now in this industry but we are

2086
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,600
still the early days uh where we have

2087
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,880
critical system system running and if we

2088
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,840
have the full understanding of the

2089
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,080
end model of the running applications

2090
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,040
this means that we understand better or

2091
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,679
what we can understand understand better

2092
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,840
what kinds of

2093
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,120
traffic that we can block for example

2094
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,320
uh

2095
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,679
how it will uh affect my dose to my my

2096
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,760
industrial plant so this this

2097
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,880
can uh

2098
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,520
give us more control about also the

2099
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,280
decisions made

2100
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,600
based on in issue rules in issue actions

2101
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,080
and we are trying to do it in top of

2102
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,520
modbus or profitable networks so

2103
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,679
we are staying in the early days but we

2104
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:54,880
think that

2105
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,679
here we can may maybe have something

2106
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,280
so

2107
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,440
that's all for now i think i have two

2108
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,760
more slides but i'm not gonna use it use

2109
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,360
them so

2110
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,679
please feel free to make making any

2111
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,480
comments uh

2112
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,280
we are open to new contributors and you

2113
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,280
contribute contributions and equations

2114
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,239
are in signals

2115
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,920
so yeah thank you um from the room or on

2116
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,679
the remote side any comments or

2117
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,600
questions about this i mean

2118
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,679
we might have seen this already in opsar

2119
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,760
so the uptake might be a little bit

2120
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,880
low but any case

2121
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,320
system additional

2122
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,280
comments on this work

2123
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,600
otherwise i always uh

2124
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,679
give a thumbs up for the practical side

2125
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,960
of things so thank you for that

2126
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,880
but if there's no other questions from

2127
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,960
the room here thank you for your time

2128
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,040
and your presentation

2129
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,360
and

2130
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,920
i'd like to

2131
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,400
change to our final presentation then

2132
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,920
which i have to find

2133
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,239
again

2134
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,600
of course

2135
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,560
there's a

2136
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,440
trigger word there

2137
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,679
and brandon

2138
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,920
it's you

2139
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,600
yes um

2140
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,400
i

2141
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,320
presented this one

2142
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,199
um

2143
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,880
actually i've presented it twice in the

2144
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,920
past

2145
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,120
and uh

2146
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,840
it's in a slightly new form now um i

2147
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,800
think it's much better now uh the the

2148
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,239
new format for this draft um next next

2149
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,559
slide please

2150
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,400
um yeah forget everything i've i've

2151
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,520
stripped out

2152
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,239
most of the text from version zero um

2153
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,960
i've kept a few things around but it's

2154
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,960
uh roughly the same content in a much

2155
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,199
hopefully better form next please

2156
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,040
so uh the question is what is the root

2157
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,880
of a security architecture

2158
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,400
and um

2159
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,639
i i would argue that the root of it is

2160
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,560
knowing which threats it mitigates if

2161
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,840
you don't know which threats your

2162
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,920
security archer architecture mitigates

2163
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,600
all you have at the end is a warm fuzzy

2164
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,120
feeling and uh that may not be helpful

2165
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,360
uh so i maintain that all security

2166
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,280
architectures should have threat models

2167
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,159
so since i didn't have one i've put one

2168
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,679
in so iot nets now has a threat model

2169
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,080
some guiding usability requirements some

2170
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,480
risks some mitigations for those threats

2171
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,080
and technologies to implement the

2172
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,280
mitigations

2173
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,440
and this was an attempt to

2174
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,000
approach the ask that eliot lear gave me

2175
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,199
after the initial draft um which was

2176
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,239
essentially a menu of technologies

2177
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,199
and

2178
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,440
why you might want to use them

2179
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,239
next slide please

2180
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,840
so i've covered 10 top level threats

2181
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,320
some of them have a few sub threats and

2182
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,719
i i could go through them all here but

2183
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,719
honestly it's better to go through the

2184
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,800
draft and have a look at them the

2185
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,400
important thing here is that these are

2186
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,840
all threats that probably have relevance

2187
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,639
in

2188
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:11,600
um

2189
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,480
networks containing iot devices and a

2190
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,239
lot of them have to do with threats

2191
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,000
directly against the devices some of

2192
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,120
them also have to do with threats

2193
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,800
against the network

2194
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,679
next slide please

2195
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,280
so i've covered uh a set of technologies

2196
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,520
uh nine of them in total uh although

2197
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,199
you'll see that the device isolation

2198
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:36,239
ones actually span out quite a lot to uh

2199
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,480
substantially more there

2200
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,880
these cover uh technologies that are

2201
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,800
developed in the ietf and a few from

2202
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,199
outside largely to do with provisioning

2203
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,040
they are primarily security technologies

2204
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,840
next slide please

2205
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,679
there are a lot of things that are not

2206
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,840
in the draft uh the current threat model

2207
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,639
is quite minimal uh it covers uh

2208
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,960
essentially just the things that are

2209
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,880
necessary to justify the technologies

2210
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,560
that i put in there's probably a lot

2211
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,880
more threats that we need to look at it

2212
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,120
um the technologies that we've i've

2213
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,120
covered are fairly minimal there's no

2214
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,920
mention of transports for example so

2215
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,000
things like tls dtls coap

2216
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,719
none of that is in this draft and i'm

2217
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,719
not sure if it belongs there or not i'd

2218
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:29,600
appreciate feedback on that

2219
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,199
and there's missing guidance on

2220
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,320
non-security aspects of iot ops for

2221
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,120
example human readable formats do not

2222
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,800
belong on constrained nodes so we uh

2223
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,560
i haven't put anything about that in

2224
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,280
there

2225
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,719
maybe i should

2226
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:45,600
uh

2227
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,960
maybe we should

2228
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,320
author's welcome

2229
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,840
um

2230
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,080
or maybe that needs to be a different

2231
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,239
draft entirely but i could see an

2232
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,679
argument for

2233
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,920
guiding principles on the

2234
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,040
interoperability of iot devices

2235
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,840
next slide please

2236
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,840
um yes authors if you have strong

2237
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,960
feelings about this area please join in

2238
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,239
um this is not going to be a great work

2239
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:16,000
unless there are lots of viewpoints and

2240
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,520
lots of input

2241
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,000
otherwise you're just going to get a

2242
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,360
document that writes down brendan's

2243
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,040
opinions and i'm not sure that's what

2244
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,239
everyone needs

2245
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:27,199
so uh please contribute and uh please

2246
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,840
let me know if you would like to add to

2247
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,880
this and with that in this you know 30

2248
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,239
seconds i've taken to go through my

2249
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:36,480
slide deck um i'd be happy to talk about

2250
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,520
anything else in this if there are any

2251
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,080
questions or comments or things that are

2252
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,600
obvious that i've missed et cetera et

2253
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,000
cetera

2254
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,960
michael's already moving into the mic

2255
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,120
hi michael richardson here

2256
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,199
um i i think i read zero zero and i

2257
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,679
think i read zero one um

2258
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,600
i'm not keen on the wreck

2259
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,440
stuff and the titles i think i said that

2260
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,480
already

2261
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,440
um

2262
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,120
i don't think the title reflects the

2263
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,960
content of the document

2264
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,400
not anymore um

2265
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,679
um so

2266
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,000
so that's something to think about um

2267
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,920
and i guess it's a little bit abruptly

2268
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,000
ends from section two and suddenly goes

2269
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,159
into normative references and somehow i

2270
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:19,440
feel like we you know uh uh at least at

2271
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,560
least there should be a security

2272
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,360
considerations hiding in there right

2273
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,960
well i mean the whole document this

2274
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,760
whole document is about security yes but

2275
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,440
um

2276
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,839
uh so

2277
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,440
without criticizing any specific part of

2278
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,800
the document

2279
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,679
um

2280
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,719
i'm unclear what the actionable

2281
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,880
outcomes of this

2282
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,560
for the reader are

2283
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,760
um

2284
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,000
uh and that that's maybe something that

2285
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,880
we really need to to discuss about that

2286
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,760
right

2287
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,639
um

2288
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:53,440
so

2289
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,800
i'm i'm i'm happy to have a what's the

2290
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,480
right word a survey

2291
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,360
document of itf

2292
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,280
specs and other specs that are important

2293
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,639
and that's part of the purpose of this

2294
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,719
working group so i i'm not saying we

2295
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:07,920
shouldn't do it

2296
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,600
i'm just saying that

2297
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,639
if they're

2298
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,040
um

2299
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,800
we need to think about what what what

2300
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,320
the readers uh uh next step is

2301
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,880
when they get this document okay and

2302
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,880
um that may take a little bit of

2303
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,639
thinking as to what we're really doing

2304
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,639
and i i guess hank we were supposed to

2305
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,040
have a what are we doing the next year

2306
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,719
discussion and we haven't had that last

2307
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,000
time and i don't think we're having it

2308
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,800
this time oh no this is

2309
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,280
evolving into that actually yeah okay

2310
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,040
well i think we actually given that we

2311
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,360
lost one co-chair uh and we had the

2312
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,080
internet go down we might i said this i

2313
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,000
said this last time actually that maybe

2314
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,239
maybe we need to do this and it's friday

2315
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,719
afternoon or probably all baked um

2316
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:51,679
um

2317
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,760
maybe we need to do this as a virtual

2318
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,679
interim where we can actually just focus

2319
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,159
on that one topic for that and i think

2320
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,360
this document actually may take us there

2321
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,199
right so so

2322
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:06,239
they're not as you said unconnected but

2323
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,440
anyway

2324
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,199
thank you brandon

2325
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,120
i would definitely contribute more more

2326
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,920
things to it i i i i see it is a bit

2327
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,280
thin and i think we can go quite

2328
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,440
extensively on some of the items

2329
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,360
uh the question i think really is again

2330
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,080
is

2331
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,520
let's figure out what we're trying to

2332
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,280
tell people

2333
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,000
uh uh here and

2334
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,760
what the conclusion is supposed to be

2335
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,239
let's write the conclusion first right

2336
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,080
the the goal was to be a landing pad

2337
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,440
document for iot security and and say

2338
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,360
you know this this is

2339
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,679
a a broad scope of different things that

2340
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,199
you may encounter as a iot device vendor

2341
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,840
or iot network vendor and this is uh you

2342
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,600
know the the sort of things that you may

2343
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,600
encounter the sort of concerns you may

2344
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,400
have

2345
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,600
and if you have such a concern then here

2346
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,840
are the ways that you get around it here

2347
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,600
are the solutions to the problem that

2348
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,719
you just discovered you have

2349
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,040
so i understood that there's

2350
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,360
and micro every move your hand um there

2351
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,679
was one person who has read the

2352
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:10,800
minus

2353
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,560
the dash one

2354
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,960
so what i'm going to put it through here

2355
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,520
is this

2356
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,560
did anybody else

2357
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,159
this is a public face

2358
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,400
do i raise my hand as the author no

2359
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,760
you know about memory

2360
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,360
okay so

2361
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,400
apparently

2362
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,320
michael is correct

2363
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,119
this can't be a a thing we uh uh can

2364
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,360
talk about content buys today if only

2365
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,960
two people actually have read it but i

2366
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,040
think um this one i would encourage

2367
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,920
actually to read to prepare for a set

2368
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,000
um virtual interim yes we are all back

2369
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,040
this is a friday zombie slot but still i

2370
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,719
think that was something i wanted to

2371
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,560
know and here we go

2372
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,639
so i'm capturing um

2373
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,560
capturing this result

2374
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,840
and i will uh do another

2375
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,560
one um

2376
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,520
who

2377
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,840
this is helpful is another pop quest so

2378
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,280
who will probably

2379
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,639
in the uh

2380
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,560
in the position to uh

2381
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,840
review this in order to bring it in

2382
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,440
shape uh i heard

2383
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,440
that security consideration by this

2384
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,960
document basically is security

2385
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,560
conservation might be something that is

2386
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,320
uh not so easy

2387
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,119
and also that this could be a map

2388
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,880
that is really helpful

2389
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,800
and um

2390
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,199
it just critical mass and i think four

2391
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,790
is critical

2392
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:50,560
[Laughter]

2393
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,360
yeah so uh i wanted to set these four

2394
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,280
hands otherwise i would be like okay

2395
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,159
this is major friday um

2396
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:02,320
okay um get in contact with uh brandon

2397
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,239
we can chat on the list and we can

2398
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,440
create a virtual interim for this kind

2399
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,840
of work we can

2400
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,639
co-locate a comparison document

2401
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,239
that we're talking about but there's no

2402
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,560
document yet so that might be a little

2403
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,840
bit premature

2404
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,320
um i will talk with hannes about him

2405
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,159
nuclear in something there

2406
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:26,159
and so i will end this poll

2407
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,880
and yeah this is basically what i wanted

2408
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,679
to see and um if this could be something

2409
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:32,800
that uh

2410
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,800
the majority of the working group has a

2411
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,040
consensus with then we can actually

2412
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,840
start adopt our first document but it's

2413
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
important that we actually involve the

2414
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,280
people so we have to float this a little

2415
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,600
bit that's on all of the here and the

2416
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,520
group right now who can hear me who

2417
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,480
might

2418
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,360
eventually read the minutes

2419
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,480
and then

2420
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,960
and then go from there so uh um i would

2421
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,440
agree with michael that we can't really

2422
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,880
um have a content discussion unless

2423
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,040
there's still some questions or comments

2424
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:07,560
uh in the room or from remote

2425
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,360
going once going twice

2426
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,440
okay but people will read the draft i

2427
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,639
like that so uh please do and then

2428
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:21,199
i think november is a little bit in the

2429
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,760
future we can have a fine interim on a

2430
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,719
single topic i think

2431
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,920
and with that

2432
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,840
if there's no any other business

2433
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:39,679
i would say we adjourn this meeting

2434
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,119
thank you brandon

2435
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,280

2440
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:05,199

2441
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,119
we never really

2442
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,040
end

2443
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,600
you just pause

2444
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,199
social

2445
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,360
and warren you have to show me what you

2446
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:42,199
did what magic you did with this thing

2447
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,960
because i was like i'm a magician

2448
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,760
i can't put this off

2449
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,130
[Music]

2450
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:46,199
