where we all spend way too much on

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
looking at video screens

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,920
um

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,239

event um i also want to thank everyone

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
each and every one of you for all the

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
hard work over the years in making

64
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,239
internet delivery what it has been right

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,760
if you really take a step back and think

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
about this march 13th which was a friday

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
of 2020 we all went home

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
okay and the network in a day needed to

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
adapt to a scenario that none of us

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
really expected right who would have

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
thought that in our lifetimes we all

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,440
would go home jump on teams and zooms

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
and you know what whatever other video

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,800
communication

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,879
um that you're using

76
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
and stay there for two years straight

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
and really be able to adapt and grow and

78
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,680
add additional subscribers to the

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
network while we were doing this uh

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,159
truly unprecedented uh and it really

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
speaks to the robustness of the

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
engineering work and and

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
and work that we've done together as an

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
industry and i mean industry in the

85
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
broader sense of the world uh in order

86
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
to uh harden the internet delivery to

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
the point where in this country uh we

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,599
were one of the um the only countries in

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
the world where we did not need to go to

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
netflix to ask them to downgrade their

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
video delivery

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
europe other parts of the world not here

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,799
and i take

94
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,560
quite a bit of pride in that i really do

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
is having the opportunity to lead the

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
team uh as we've uh done that uh and i

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,519
had a great discussion earlier with

98
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,918
stuart at apple who commented about the

99
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,199
uh improvements that we've done in

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
latency throughout all of this uh and

101
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
that i think again that speaks volume to

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
the technical leadership uh that you

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
know comes from this organization and

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,479
many thanks for that

105
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,280
okay

106
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
let's start talking about our actual uh

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
roadmap so

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
first and foremost for the folks who are

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
not familiar with comcast or you know

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
maybe familiar but don't quite

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
understand how big our network is it's

112
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,759
really big

113
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
it's really really big uh when you

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,680
really look at the network end-to-end

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
over a million

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
miles of fiber and co-ox plant spread

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
across the entire us

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
uh 39 states uh in the district of

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
columbia um where we service our

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,919
customers uh throughout that footprint

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
in terms of the delivery

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
how many transactions are we actually

123
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
carrying through and i think that that

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
is uh such i'm trying to you know

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
balance between all these screens uh so

126
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
that you could still see the screen and

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
i could uh you know not uh you know get

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
out of uh view for the lens

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
um

130
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,800
1.3 trillion dns lookups every day

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
1.3 trillion

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,840
uh capacity literally doubling on the

133
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
access network every two and a half

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
years so think about it this way comcast

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
has been in the high-speed uh uh

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
business since uh late uh the late 90s

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
right and every two and a half years we

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
need to double what it took us to build

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
30 years

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
pretty pretty amazing

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,440
and

142
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,759
when you look at

143
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,479
the

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,199
investment that we continuously put into

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,080
the network in 2021 alone and i'll talk

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
about the stats of 2021 and one of the

147
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
next slides we've invested over four

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
billion dollars into the network uh and

149
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
over 20 billion dollars over the uh you

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
know the uh the horizon since uh 2017

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
and this year we're continuously um in

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
uh continuing with our investment in the

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
network uh because capacity continues to

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
grow our customer needs continue to

155
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,000
evolve

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
and my team's job is to make sure that

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
the network will always be infinitely

158
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,280
scalable and will be able to never

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
endure business growth

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
okay

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
so let's go into uh

162
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
what 2021 was and it's funny to

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,280
summarize 2021 were

164
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
almost uh in august of uh 2022.

165
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
uh but it's i thought it would be

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
interesting to kind of take a step back

167
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
and look at you know where we come from

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
before we talk about where we head into

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,680
as

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
much as we saw

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,800
internet growth in 2020 and we saw

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
explosive internet growth and added

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,080
millions of subscribers to our network

174
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
which we're very happy to do

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
um

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,319
in 2021 we continue to grow

177
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
usage

178
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,880
okay both downstream and upstream so

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
downstream continued to increase at peak

180
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
at 11

181
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
upstream increase by 5

182
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
um what's really interesting in all of

183
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
that is that while

184
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
capacity continues to grow

185
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,080
the customer needs are still very much

186
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
asymmetrical

187
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
okay there's a lot of

188
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,919
buzz around symmetry this and symmetry

189
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
dot right but the reality of it is that

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
at the height of kovid

191
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
um and you see it you know here uh in

192
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
terms of the uh uh the the ratios at the

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
height of kovid we saw downstream to

194
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
upstream ratio be at 12.4

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,360
okay

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
in the second half of 21 as we kind of

197
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
all were coming out of our uh sheltering

198
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
in place that went back up to over 14 to

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
one which is where it was prior to the

200
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
pandemic okay and so the reality of it

201
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
is that the network is still

202
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
very much

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
a downstream delivery network

204
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
okay it's not to say that upstream is

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
not important it is

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
um and we've seen some pretty

207
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
significant obviously traffic increases

208
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
on the upstream driven by video

209
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
telecommunications

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,759
but

211
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
it's still very much driven by

212
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
downstream consumption primarily

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
entertainment services that's not a

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
surprise

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,760
right and as you see those ott services

216
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,599
continue to proliferate um i just so uh

217
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,360
a research note today tivo is saying

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
that the average consumer has nine

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
different

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
streaming services

221
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
uh unfortunately there's only 24 hours

222
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
in a day right so you know you just you

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
know there's a you know you've reached a

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
substitutive effect in terms of what

225
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
they actually watch uh but those are the

226
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
growth rate that we uh you know we we

227
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
needed to accommodate and continue to

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
accommodate from a subscriber's

229
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
standpoint

230
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,680
um and then you know last but not least

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
um while video conferencing share of

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
peak network traffic

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
um um literally doubled during the

234
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
pandemic

235
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
okay doubled one day uh it's still only

236
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
five percent actually less than five

237
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
percent of the total bits carried on the

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
network

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
okay now if this guy has anything to do

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
with it you know they'll uh you know

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,040
they'll uh you know we'll all be

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
broadcasting at 8k out of our home

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
but you know the reality is that you

244
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
know for the uh you know for the uh

245
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,200
current uh subscriber um trajectory it's

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
you just put that into a perspective

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
okay

248
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
let's talk about you know what it means

249
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,800
to the network and what i try to show

250
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
here is both kind of the physical

251
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,120
topology but also the spectral topology

252
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
of what the comcast network uh uh

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,640
represents so 60 million homes the vast

254
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
majority of the network which i'll start

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
you know down below is rated at 750

256
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
megahertz of of spectral capacity okay

257
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,959
of which

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,760
the small part of which you see down

259
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
below on the left-hand side

260
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
uh between 5 and 42 megahertz is

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
dedicated to upstream

262
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,640
everything else is dedicated to

263
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
downstream and is really shared by the

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
various formats of docsis over cable

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
delivery

266
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,760
um

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
and traditional video channel deliveries

268
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
while all of our lineup does is carried

269
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
in ip we still deliver uh uh

270
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
channels two traditional set of boxes

271
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
are quan based

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
okay

273
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
um in terms of uh the physical plant you

274
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,399
know what what it looks like for

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
high-speed data delivery uh

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,920
traditionally we relied on separate pipe

277
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
delivery the cmts or the cable modem

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,959
termination system uh that delivers the

279
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
doxa signals uh to our high-speed data

280
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
subscribers and then all t the uh the

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
optical

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
equivalent of a cmts um that you know

283
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,519
delivers uh services to our fiber to the

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,600
home subscribers okay

285
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
the vast majority of delivery is over

286
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,279
docsis but we do have parts of the

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,839
network that are fed with fiber

288
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,839
and what you see here

289
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
is a typical cable architecture

290
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
which relies on analog fiber

291
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
from the cmts which resides in a local

292
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,279
data center

293
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
typically closer to the subscriber

294
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
because of the analog optics limitations

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
feeding an analog node

296
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
the reason for that is historical it's

297
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,160
the technology that existed when uh the

298
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
two-way cable plant was built

299
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,639
and then we used amplifiers to basically

300
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,040
amplify and extend the rf reach all the

301
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
way down to the home

302
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
what you're seeing here in cable lingo

303
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
is something called n plus five the node

304
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
plus five

305
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
uh amplifiers and this cascade

306
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,800
okay and this is kind of a

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
what a traditional cable network um

308
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
looks like uh not just for comcast but

309
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
you know among our other cable brethrens

310
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
and the challenge with this is really

311
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,079
twofold right number one is notice that

312
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,560
while the network is asymmetric uh

313
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
there's obviously a very small sliver of

314
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
capacity that is available to be sent

315
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,680
upstream

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
those are not easy

317
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
things to fix because they're really

318
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
limited by

319
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,079
rated devices in the network that are

320
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,639
able to pass or not pass frequencies in

321
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,800
order to change the number of lanes that

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
are dedicated uh to uh uh to upstream

323
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
and downstream delivery okay

324
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,320
um we've spent a lot of time in and

325
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
great innovation led by dan rice who is

326
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
sitting right here on a platform called

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
octave which was rushed to market during

328
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
the pandemic and is really the first

329
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,320
time where we've implemented ai and ml

330
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
in live in real time across our network

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
in order to optimize the bit delivery to

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
the individual customers right because

333
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,720
network conditions vary across the board

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
uh the signal down to my house may be

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
impaired by lte interference so maybe

336
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
have you know i have a connector that

337
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
needs to be tightened up which sending

338
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
noise upstream and that may be impacting

339
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
the efficiency of the bits that i may be

340
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
able to deliver to home and so octave

341
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,079
which is the platform that we built is

342
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
able to make those decisions in real

343
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
time with real-time polling and so the

344
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
bit delivery down to dan rice's home may

345
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,320
be better than it is for me but we both

346
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
are getting the service that is

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
optimized to the then current network

348
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,600
conditions

349
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,480
okay

350
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,959
um and and what we've done is we've

351
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,360
taken a smart network and we made it

352
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
brilliant and by doing that we were able

353
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
to generate another 45 percent of

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
capacity at the time that we needed it

355
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,120
the most by reliant on pure software

356
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
innovation

357
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
so really exciting times even doing

358
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
pandemic okay

359
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,880
now the challenge that we have is analog

360
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,000
optics

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
in a world of you know everything

362
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
digital

363
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
a cmts which is an appliance-based um

364
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
architecture in a world that is all web

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
scale and web speed how do we evolve uh

366
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,839
the architecture uh to uh to be able to

367
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
authorize the network challenge and

368
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
about five years ago i got this amazing

369
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,079
opportunity to really take this on at

370
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,880
comcast and lead this virtualization

371
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
transition

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,199
across the board so why don't we go to

373
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,000
the next slide please

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
and what you're seeing here is the

375
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
continuous

376
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
evolution and innovation on the access

377
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,440
network and i'm going to start with the

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
spectrum and you'll see that

379
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,880
uh what we're doing is we're doing two

380
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
things number one is we're increasing

381
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
the size of the pipe okay to either one

382
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,199
gigahertz or 1.2 gigahertz

383
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,800
why are we doing this because the

384
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,959
customer needs continue to evolve right

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
you know how do we continue to have the

386
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,360
pipe that is there whether the capacity

387
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
is needed today or whether it's going to

388
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
be needed 10 years from now right

389
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,720
those are very large lengthy upgrades

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
that we we need to go through the second

391
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
piece is that notice that we're

392
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,399
increasing the amount of capacity that

393
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
is dedicated to upstream by executing on

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
something called mid-split okay

395
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
there's an another split called high

396
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
split which extends the upstream

397
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,360
frequencies all the way up to 204

398
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
megahertz the reason why we chose a

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,240
mid-split is you see that guard band

400
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
that white space uh in between uh it's

401
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,279
there you know so that we could continue

402
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
to deliver video services to cable cards

403
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
and other retail devices uninterrupted

404
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,839
okay

405
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
um and it's really important for us that

406
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
as the network progresses we're not

407
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
interrupting uh or disrupting the

408
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
customer delivery uh from a service

409
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
standpoint even on legacy video quant

410
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
video not just legacy

411
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,920
um what we're also doing is that we're

412
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
virtualizing the entire delivery system

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,639
and so we have launched several years

414
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
ago what we call our virtual cmps

415
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,759
by disaggregating and separating the

416
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,839
hardware from the software we're able to

417
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
innovate in web scale and web speeds uh

418
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
we're running on intel-based platforms

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,279
instead of proprietary

420
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,480
appliances um you know put that in

421
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
perspective we're on our second

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
generation of that platform about to

423
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,759
transition to the third generation of

424
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
that platform um all riding on intel's

425
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,639
moore's law coattail um you know with uh

426
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,759
effectively

427
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,519
enabling to double the density and

428
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,920
capacity uh writing moore's law rather

429
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
than you know reliant on proprietary

430
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,399
chipset applications

431
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,000
um we're

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
transitioning to brand new digital um

433
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
fiber capabilities which enable us to

434
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
extend the distance um you know on the

435
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
physical plant which enables us to

436
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
invest

437
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,880
more

438
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
into what we call the critical

439
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,839
infrastructure

440
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
how do we make sure that we have backup

441
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
power backup cooling back up everything

442
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
uh in a uh in a world where the power

443
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
grid uh is suffering from uh the weather

444
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
events that we uh you know we all

445
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
experience every day uh if you walked

446
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
outside you know today or yesterday

447
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,480
rather you understand what i'm talking

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,679
about

449
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,799
and then

450
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,599
the

451
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,559
amplifiers on the network are upgraded

452
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
in order to pass these additional

453
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,280
upstream capabilities to fully take

454
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
advantage of these speeds this is

455
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,880
something that we're doing

456
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
across our network right now

457
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,320
and working very hard because one it

458
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
enables us to literally triple the

459
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
amount of upstream capacity that we're

460
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
able to deliver

461
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
significantly increase

462
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
speeds on the upstream uh and really

463
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,520
drive a lot more usage uh if and when

464
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
customers are gonna demand those uh

465
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
additional upstream services uh driven

466
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,559
by gaming or you know vr or whatever it

467
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,880
is that uh you know will come

468
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
okay

469
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,200
um if we go to the next slide please

470
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
uh we're not done

471
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
right and when we say we're not done is

472
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
uh that's really a stepping stone into

473
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
evolving our network into what we call

474
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,360
the axis 4.0 uh in this case it's the

475
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
full duplex uh version of docsis 4.0

476
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
there's an extended spectrum

477
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,320
optionality to the docsis 4.0 spec uh

478
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,600
and what docsis 4.0 enables us to do is

479
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
deliver multiple gigabit symmetrical

480
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,799
services

481
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,760
on the same crossover network that we're

482
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,120
putting in place

483
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
with our you know um our network rebuild

484
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
okay

485
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,919
and what's really exciting about this is

486
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,000
you know take a step back for the first

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
time we talked about the asymmetry and

488
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
the frequency dedication

489
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
or separation rather between upstream

490
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,039
and downstream and how much of the plant

491
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,960
is dedicated to downstream

492
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,520
what fdx

493
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,039
doxy4.fdx enables us to do

494
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,679
is with advancement in compute we're

495
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,160
able to overlay

496
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,879
i need you to mute

497
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
it's the story of my life the muting

498
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
you're mute

499
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
there you go um

500
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
so what uh

501
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
nope

502
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,820
no you're not a mute

503
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,780
[Laughter]

504
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
it's okay no problem

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
um

506
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
it's uh it's it's it's the story of our

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,520
lives really over the last two and a

508
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
half years but that's why it's so great

509
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
to be here with you we kid that we can

510
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
control that um so what docsis4.ofdx

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,559
does is enables to overlay

512
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
upstream and downstream frequencies

513
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,640
right on top of the other uh with uh

514
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,880
echo cancellation innovation which we're

515
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
working to uh develop and build into the

516
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,559
plant uh and be able to service those

517
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
multiple gigabit symmetrical services on

518
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,159
this

519
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
while still maintaining and you see it

520
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,919
you know down below all of the

521
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,080
subscribers that have equipment that is

522
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
not compatible with access 4.0 okay so

523
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
the mid-split modems will continue to

524
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,360
function the legacy video delivery will

525
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
continue to function and all of that

526
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
we'll be able to do on our coaxial cable

527
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
i had the privilege of demoing this

528
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
technology at cablelabs back in april

529
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
we were able to demonstrate nine

530
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
gigabits down and five gigabits up

531
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
uh on this uh under service uh and

532
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
what's really cool about this is with

533
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
the virtualization innovation uh that uh

534
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
you know we've uh worked on for the past

535
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
four or five years uh we're able to do

536
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
this is a software download on the

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
virtualized platform

538
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
okay

539
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
uh electronic upgrades to the nodes and

540
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
the amps

541
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
and now you have a coaxial cable plant

542
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
where we're able to deliver multiple

543
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
gigabit symmetrical services without

544
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
needing to dig up everyone's front uh

545
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
yards and everyone's sidewalks and an

546
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
eight-hour fiber installation and

547
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,000
everything else that

548
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
some of our fiber veterans are dealing

549
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,280
with

550
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,039
that's the innovation that is the

551
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
comcast commitment

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
uh to continuous

553
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
investment in the network in our

554
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
technology and into products and

555
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,760
services that our customers continue to

556
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,559
demand of us as technology continues to

557
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,679
evolve

558
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
super exciting to see it happening but

559
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,159
we're not done there uh let's go to the

560
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
next slide please

561
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,200
i talked earlier about

562
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
the low latency delivery and what we do

563
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
what we've done in terms of active queue

564
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
management during the height of the

565
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
pandemic and how and again then rice's

566
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
team here

567
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
really helped us to uh optimize the cmps

568
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,039
delivery configurations so that we don't

569
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
just take care of capacity and we don't

570
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
just take care of speed yes we deliver

571
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
gigabit services to more customers than

572
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
anyone else

573
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
anyone else

574
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,760
but speed is one element

575
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
the actual effectiveness of the bit

576
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
delivery is as critical

577
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
and we have some pretty pioneering work

578
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
that is already underway uh in terms of

579
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,320
docsis 3.1 low latency implementation

580
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
both on the network and on the wi-fi

581
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
side of things so that we could deliver

582
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,760
end-to-end

583
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,200
low-latency

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
uh docsis delivery sub 10 milliseconds

585
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,440
across our entire network uh and be able

586
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
to do that uh in in great scale

587
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,039
so pretty exciting uh innovative work

588
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
still ahead of us i haven't even talked

589
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
about how the same virtualized platform

590
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
uh effectively

591
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,360
abstracts the wired delivery and so i

592
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
mentioned earlier the fiber to the home

593
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
delivery that we have

594
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,080
and we with the virtualized platform and

595
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,760
the distributed access architecture that

596
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
we put in place we're able to deliver

597
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,840
those multiple gigabit symmetrical

598
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,480
services on whether the fiber is coaxial

599
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,799
or whether the fiber is fiber or whether

600
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,320
the wires fiber

601
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
because again the customers don't care

602
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
whether there's clocks in the black

603
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
wire or whether there is um a glass in

604
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,720
the black wire they want to make sure

605
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
that the products and services that they

606
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,240
rely on uh they continue to uh to deploy

607
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,039
uh with the virtualized architecture

608
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
with the digital connection

609
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,480
uh what i

610
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
um emotionally excited about

611
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
is the real-time visibility

612
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
and the real-time traceability that we

613
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
have to the service end-to-end it's a

614
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,320
digital connection

615
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
it's now doesn't rely on polling

616
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,760
technology anymore it actually streams

617
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
the real-time customer experience

618
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,679
across this network uh in real time so

619
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,720
that we could

620
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
act on it you know i mentioned the

621
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
octave um

622
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
ai engine that we built

623
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
for bit optimization

624
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
imagine if you will the same thing for

625
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
fiber connectivity imagine the same

626
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,919
thing for rf impairments on the network

627
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,760
that may or may not be disrupting

628
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
customers

629
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
imagine if you will service

630
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,799
interruptions where we're able to detect

631
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,400
in five seconds

632
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
instead of you know polling technology

633
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
which is ultimately limited by the cpu

634
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
on the appliance and so on and so forth

635
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,919
and so

636
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,080
this architecture beyond the fact that

637
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,159
it's going to be faster beyond the fact

638
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,480
that it's going to deliver low latency

639
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,919
like no other uh is truly extensive it's

640
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,120
truly broadly deployed uh you know we

641
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
don't dig this side of the street or

642
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,919
that side of the street all of our

643
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,240
customers are able to experience gigabit

644
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,080
speeds today and they'll be able to

645
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
experience even better in the future

646
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,279
so

647
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,600
that's my uh my story for the uh for the

648
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
path of 10g

649
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,520
um and i'll pause here and i'm happy to

650
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,840
take any questions that you uh you may

651
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,760
have whether it's uh here in a room and

652
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,159
let me start in a room uh and then you

653
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,240
know we could uh you know jump in and

654
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
take any virtual questions and stuart go

655
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,480
ahead

656
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,919
okay that's better

657
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,600
i don't have a question i just came up

658
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,880
to thank you

659
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
for your presentation

660
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
to thank comcast

661
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,760
for its ongoing support of the ietf

662
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
to thank all the comcast engineers like

663
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,159
jason living good and others that i work

664
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,760
with for

665
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,919
the amazing work you do

666
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
being on the forefront

667
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,960
of creating new technology and i'm not

668
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
going to name other names but there are

669
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
other isps and operators who are not

670
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,240
here

671
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
who are very clearly playing catch up

672
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
and five years from now they'll be

673
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
finally figuring out what you're doing

674
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,799
and realizing why they're falling behind

675
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,960
so wonderful work that you're doing well

676
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
it means a lot coming from you

677
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
personally um it means a lot you know

678
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,039
for me

679
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,960
uh is having the opportunity to lead

680
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
this team through this transition

681
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,520
because

682
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
this is not easy

683
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,000
okay this is not uh and when you're in

684
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
the typical sphere of technology you

685
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,600
know guess what you know the first year

686
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
and a half of working through the the

687
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,679
virtualized platform

688
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,320
we did not sleep honestly

689
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
um because uh because you know it looks

690
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,559
great on powerpoint

691
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,240
right but when you try and put this in

692
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
front of paying subscribers you run into

693
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
you know any possible corner case you

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,799
may run into and obstructing hardware

695
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
from software uh you know really um is

696
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
uh

697
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,000
is easy to say on powerpoint it's not

698
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,919
easy to do in practice

699
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
uh but with all the lessons learned um

700
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
i'm so proud to see what the team was

701
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,440
able to accomplish

702
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,679
um and you see that with the millions of

703
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,440
subscribers that are on this uh platform

704
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
right now so it really means the world

705
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,000
to us it really does thank you

706
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
thank you and i just realized poor

707
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
microphone etiquette i didn't say who i

708
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,360
am uh this is stuart cheshire from apple

709
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,320
thank you thank you

710
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
[Music]

711
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,159
and we have one uh in the queue uh

712
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
yoshido asks if we are providing ipv6 to

713
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,960
customers yet

714
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,520
and if so um what sort of size prefix

715
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,279
length do we provide that that's a shoe

716
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,720
in for you because you know you've

717
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
launched ipv6

718
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,960
the answer is yes we do and uh generally

719
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
uh 56 or 60 uh yeah

720
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,000
and and and i would say what's really

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
what really makes the comcast network

722
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,200
unique is not only are we providing ipv6

723
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
we're providing ipv6 multicast on the

724
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
video side which uh you know um it's

725
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,559
quite the complication from a delivery

726
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,679
standpoint

727
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
uh it is a very very unique uh comcast

728
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,399
case

729
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,159
uh because uh

730
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,240
you know when you look at uh some of the

731
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,399
third-party applications you know at the

732
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,880
the nos level it's uh it's not a

733
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
requirement that is uh

734
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,640
very broadly adopted uh you know across

735
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
the uh the industry at large

736
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,200
we had to do it because of the way our

737
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
video delivery pipeline is

738
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,120
any other questions

739
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,480
my name is amir jandy so sorry go right

740
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,159
up to the mic so the stream can hear you

741
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
uh can you hear me perfect yeah so amir

742
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,760
virginia so um i so you actually did a

743
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
very good like interesting job and like

744
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
you know congratulations are you looking

745
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
to expand this sort of work like you

746
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,960
know to other parts of the network

747
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,039
because this is one small i mean it's

748
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,480
not a small section but it's one part of

749
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
the network so

750
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,679
wow

751
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,880
small

752
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
i i heard it

753
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
so

754
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,240
the short answer is yes but let me give

755
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,799
you the long answer too okay

756
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
we don't do technology for the sake of

757
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,520
technology

758
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
we don't right you know as much as you

759
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
know engineers like to do that that is

760
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
not uh that is a means to an end in the

761
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
end here is a customer experience it's

762
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,320
reliability it's the scalability or

763
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,960
continuous scalability and continuous

764
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,919
growth of the network okay

765
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,520
when you look at the

766
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
other side of the network

767
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
um

768
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
the smaller side of the network uh the

769
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
core network

770
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,960
is uh i'm just joking um the the

771
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,679
uh

772
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,440
when you look at the core delivery right

773
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,360
the core delivery today

774
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
uh very much uh

775
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,279
relies on appliances uh up and down uh

776
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
the delivery

777
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,200
for various historical reasons right uh

778
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
you know this is being a a vendor-led

779
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
vendor-driven um industry that had very

780
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,120
little incentive to innovate

781
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,480
disrupt

782
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
okay um and you know it it served

783
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
extraordinarily well and continues to

784
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,919
serve extraordinarily well uh but i look

785
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
at some of the work that for example att

786
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,240
has done uh in terms of of uh uh

787
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
virtualizing their core network

788
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
um and driving uh both asic and nos

789
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,440
diversity onto the core network i look

790
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
at the progressions uh in photonics

791
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,159
across the transport layer

792
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,080
and when you see innovations like zero

793
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
optics and and others you begin to uh to

794
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,640
come in and how those get paired with

795
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,960
the aggregation routers

796
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,080
um and

797
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,360
you know

798
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,520
the two coming together i think that

799
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,120
there's tremendous opportunity in the

800
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,799
core network

801
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,880
we are actively looking at you know what

802
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
the right

803
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
technology decisions are for us

804
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,080
but again to me

805
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
beyond the technology choices and beyond

806
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
the hardware and software abstraction

807
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,000
to me it's the real-time visibility uh

808
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
and how for example we rely on gnmi in

809
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,080
great scale right not just at the access

810
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,159
layer not just at the you know close to

811
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,679
the customer but really up and down uh

812
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,919
and be able to rely on on real-time

813
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,279
streaming real-time alarming and

814
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,919
real-time telemetry to start to really

815
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,720
drive ai at a grand scale across all of

816
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,799
that and that's something that we are

817
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,760
looking into and a lot more to come so

818
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,679
can i add the second question yeah yeah

819
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
yeah go so um first of all i didn't mean

820
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
to say so i just said like one portion

821
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
of the network maybe that would be hurt

822
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,679
my feelings it's too much i'm sorry

823
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,440
just allocate that english as a second

824
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
language so um

825
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
but uh so you actually bring a very good

826
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
point of like you know ai so industry is

827
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,080
talking about self-healing networks for

828
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,919
a while all that stuff that comes into

829
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
picture is that something that

830
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
do you think would

831
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
eventually i mean and everyone's talking

832
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
about it for the last like you know six

833
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,200
seven years so where do you see in your

834
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,720
opinion where that would do you think

835
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,559
the self-healing network would we will

836
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,000
see that in the next couple of years or

837
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
it's a ten-year

838
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,480
so i so i will tell you uh that again

839
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,039
with the octave example as it is right

840
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,240
now right we are uh effectively

841
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
modulating around network impairments as

842
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,080
we speak millions of times a day today

843
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
okay um and that's on the uh you know

844
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,640
the access network uh without going into

845
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,919
too many details uh at this point

846
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,399
we have a platform that we call netiq

847
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,640
uh which uh you know operates uh you

848
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,600
could

849
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,519
check it out online we actually have a

850
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,360
you know a couple postings or not that

851
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,200
does that on the core but we're just

852
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
getting started the real power here is

853
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,360
how do you connect all of them together

854
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,559
because

855
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
you know picture if you will you know

856
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
the following

857
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,399
um

858
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,279
i have four boys uh two were in college

859
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,120
doing the pandemic and came back home

860
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
because

861
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,679
you know that they closed it and then

862
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,440
two are still in school

863
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,679
uh and 15 seconds after the internet

864
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,200
goes offline

865
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
one of them at a minimum is in my home

866
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
office by letting me know that the

867
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
internet is down

868
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,679
they're like internet probes it's great

869
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,640
okay

870
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,679
um

871
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,720
and and now the real question becomes

872
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
where in the network is the impairment

873
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,519
where in the one point you know

874
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,120
something million

875
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,960
miles of cable okay fiber or clocks the

876
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320
impairment is

877
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,279
okay

878
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,600
and the problem is you're dealing with

879
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
kind of you know vertical appliances is

880
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,720
that they don't care across very well

881
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,240
right but if for example the issue was i

882
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,960
had a big um local metro area fiber cut

883
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,000
okay

884
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,559
um if you everyone i'm sure has called

885
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
their cable company to try and get

886
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
service and the first thing the unhold

887
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,559
message tells you is reboot your modem

888
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
okay well you could reboot your model a

889
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,200
thousand times if there's a fiber cut to

890
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,679
your area that's not going to help

891
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,120
right and so how do we de-duplicate the

892
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
alarms because think about the alarms

893
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
that when it just went off in our

894
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
network the cable modems were streaming

895
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,279
that they lost connection okay the smart

896
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,919
network the amplifiers the nodes

897
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,720
and the vcmts said

898
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
we're not getting traffic it's not

899
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
coming through okay

900
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,720
the local network said well i lost

901
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,559
something northbound

902
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
and now it's how do you shoot the fiber

903
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,600
in order with an otdr in order to

904
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
pinpoint exactly where the fiber

905
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
disconnect is and that's what we're

906
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
working on right now how do you tie all

907
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,280
of these indicators together

908
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,040
into a coherent

909
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
alarm that only pinpoints where the

910
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,560
breakage point is

911
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
but also then

912
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,159
has the intelligence to message to our

913
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,280
customers

914
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,599
what their expectations are

915
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
okay and so it's not just about the

916
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,119
self-healingness of this is what do you

917
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,520
tell the end customer okay don't reboot

918
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
your modem there's a fiber cut in your

919
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,879
area

920
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,119
fiber crews are aware of the issue and

921
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,440
are working to restore service the eta

922
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
is four hours

923
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,399
and that ultimately is is what the

924
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,399
network goal is

925
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,480
right because that's what our customers

926
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
expect of us

927
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,399
and that's what we're working on thank

928
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,879
you so much

929
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,839
any other

930
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,520
questions i got that one already yeah

931
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,720
next question yeah yeah please

932
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,880
uh hello i'm robert jackson so i have a

933
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,119
question do you have numbers of your tcp

934
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,520
versus udp traffic percentages lately

935
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,280
and is it affecting your

936
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,839
engineering of the network in any way

937
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,520
i don't think we uh

938
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,280
yeah i don't think we've uh shared any

939
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,119
of those stats but yeah we're watching

940
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,800
closely you know what's happening with

941
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,880
the quick and uh all these kinds of

942
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,160
things i don't think yet it's changed

943
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,520
the way that we do engineering yeah

944
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
all ip

945
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,160
that's exactly right

946
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,800
okay any uh any other questions from

947
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
anyone

948
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,720
any other questions online

949
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
i don't see any more online is there

950
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,160
another one on there yeah oh sorry i i

951
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,200
don't see the same screen

952
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,839
uh maybe the person that's online can uh

953
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,400
we lost the meat echo here

954
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,320
maybe the person online can ask your

955
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,079
question go off mute

956
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,960
sharon

957
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,680
yes hi this is sharon

958
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
i'm thinking of a

959
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,280
very large upstream application with

960
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,720
connected cars

961
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,680
hitting

962
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,400
a

963
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,079
access network

964
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,280
wall

965
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,119
with cellular

966
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
is there any thought of

967
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,160
combining docsis with wireless lan in

968
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,359
order to

969
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,440
uh free up this jam

970
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,760
any plans any thought about it

971
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
thank you

972
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,920
um

973
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
so uh sean it's a it's a good question

974
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,760
um let me let me answer it this way okay

975
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,960
comcast is not a wireless company we do

976
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
offer cellular services but they're

977
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,599
through an nvno with verizon we do have

978
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,040
a very very large wi-fi um

979
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,119
network uh in fact it's the largest in

980
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
the u.s uh which we use for you know

981
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
both you know customer benefits but also

982
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,560
as a way to offload um

983
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,119
solar minutes um and uh you know help

984
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,280
with the economics of the nvnl

985
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,400
um

986
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
as such and really driven by that

987
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
obviously

988
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
you know what's right for the comcast

989
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
network you know may be different than

990
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,960
companies like uh rogers that is

991
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
actually a wireless carrier uh and has

992
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,079
you know a tighter integration and so

993
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
sean i really think that the answer to

994
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,240
your question is probably but it really

995
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,200
depends on the actual um operator

996
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
and the the unique services that they

997
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,119
provide

998
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,960
okay

999
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,440
any other questions

1000
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,480
yes

1001
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
last one and then uh

1002
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,440
and then we'll wrap up yeah we'll wrap

1003
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,359
up sorry not a question about a comment

1004
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,440
uh jason tucker from comcast uh

1005
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,760
following up on the ipv6 question from

1006
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
earlier

1007
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
not only are we delivering ipv6 to

1008
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
customers but we were doing it at a

1009
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,040
large scale like 10 years ago so ipv6 is

1010
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,839
it's really integral to what we do at a

1011
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,560
lot of levels yeah totally and has been

1012
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
and and you're 100 right um and jason

1013
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
thank you

1014
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,839
um

1015
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,280
i would say you know last comment on

1016
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,560
this uh on the ipv6 uh pieces

1017
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
um

1018
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,640
it's so ingrained to everything that we

1019
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,000
do from a network standpoint we could

1020
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
not scale at some point we were the

1021
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,119
largest consumer of ipv4 addresses uh

1022
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,200
and and we literally hit a wall so you

1023
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,280
know this has been a uh

1024
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
instrumental for us you know to your

1025
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,960
point for many many years yes last one

1026
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,839
and then

1027
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,800
they kicked me out hi paul curtis sienna

1028
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,599
um

1029
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,960
in talking about the monitoring and

1030
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,119
troubleshooting you mentioned gnmi i

1031
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
guess i'm curious to the extent you're

1032
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
using gnmi just for monitoring also for

1033
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
all network management and if there's

1034
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,800
anything you can say about your progress

1035
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
there where you guys are at and rolling

1036
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
that out

1037
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
yeah so

1038
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,280
um

1039
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
i'm trying to think what i could say i

1040
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,640
could say that um i could say this um

1041
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,200
we're very excited about the fact that

1042
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,760
it is a common standard uh even though

1043
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,240
every vendor siena has a you know

1044
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,520
different implementation of gnmi right

1045
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,920
um you know same for the nokia person

1046
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,680
you know back there and so on and so

1047
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,079
forth okay and so part of an operator

1048
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,400
challenge is what pieces of it can you

1049
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
take that you could fairly standardize

1050
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
that you could then feed across you know

1051
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
this average ecosystem that you could

1052
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
actually act and and operationalize

1053
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
because at the end of the day you know

1054
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,760
think about the the ops people that at

1055
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,920
2am need to get an alarm and do

1056
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,079
something with it okay

1057
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,599
and that's where you know the challenge

1058
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,079
has been i want to say that uh in parts

1059
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,520
of the network we're further along in

1060
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
some parts of the network we have um you

1061
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,440
know we're just big in the beginning

1062
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,079
stages of this um but again it's

1063
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,640
exciting uh to be able to uh to leverage

1064
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,119
a uh you know a common spec across these

1065
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,880
as we're maturing the actual delivery

1066
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,560
does that make sense

1067
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,440
thank you

1068
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,839
okay great well thank you very much alad

1069
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,000
appreciate it thank you for having me

1070
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,839
thank you for coming here

1071
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,400
and again thank you for uh for your uh

1072
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
thought and technology leadership we we

1073
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
could not have done any of this without

1074
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,480
the great work that you're doing across

1075
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,280
the industry so thank you

1076
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,720
thank you so much
