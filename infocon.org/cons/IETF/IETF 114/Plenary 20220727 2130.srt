and you don't want to have a

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
out of season uh opening up here

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,520
so my name

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,640
is a really hot mic so i'm gonna hold it

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
down here um we have the usual sort of

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
presentations about various updates from

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,759
various bodies and the usual open mic

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,320
part at the end

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
i said it please wear a mask

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
when you registered you agreed to

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,920
our covet policy which requires you to

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,520
wear masks in itf controlled rooms

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
um there's some details about what types

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,520
of masks we're engineering organization

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
and we cannot just say masks

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
if you don't have one the secretariat

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
has has heaps and heaps in all colors so

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
you can like really match your outfit

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
um even spencer can match his outfit

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
which is uh i think a little bit of a

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
challenge

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,159
um and the only exception as you see i

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,439
don't wear one because i'm an active

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
speaker because i'm actively speaking so

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,719
i don't need to wear one i'm not doing

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,159
it because i think the audio quality is

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
better that way but when i'm sitting

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
down i will put one on and if i don't

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
somebody will surely remember me and

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
tell me

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
this is the node well

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
you've seen it many times it's getting

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
longer and longer and the font is

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
getting smaller and smaller basically

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
when you participate in the itf you

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
agree to

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
some

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,760
obligations and policies

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
one of them for this meeting was about

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
masks there's other ones

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
such as this closing ipr that you know

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
about

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
you agree to be civil to others and

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
follow the code of conduct

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,640
and or anti-harassment procedures um

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
you also

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
agree to the itf privacy policy that

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
means you know you might be photographed

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
unless you wear one of these spiffy red

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
lanyards which tell the photographers to

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,040
not bother you

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
if you haven't seen this

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
take a look there's a lot of interesting

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
stuff there that you might want to know

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
for those of you online

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,239
good day good evening good morning good

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
night unfortunately also for some of you

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
um when you join your audio will be

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,400
muted and your video will be off

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
um when you get in line to ask a

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,959
question later on

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
i encourage you to show your video it's

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
nice to see your face

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
also to those of you in the room please

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
use the meet echo tool um either the

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,920
full one or the

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
light version the on-site version to get

92
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
into the queue so we have one line

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,599
and then you know when you get close

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
come to the microphone

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
if you can from remote user headset you

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
can use one in the room but really it

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
doesn't serve any purpose

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
and there's a whole lot more about how

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
meat echo works and how you optimize its

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,319
use on that link on the bottom

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200

uh thank you for coming welcome back to

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
i tf71

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,060
so 2008.

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,320
[Applause]

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
i'll just make one quick

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,960
mention as a network operator

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
we have been especially during the

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
pandemic notice that latency is

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
incredibly important working latency

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
world responsiveness

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
and there was an l4s

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
uh part of the hack thing this week at

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
the beginning of the meeting

141
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
and it was nicely attended there were

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
15 companies participating in more than

143
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,039
30 people

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
and we really assured for the first time

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,160
that low latency networking worked

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
outside of the lab with multiple vendor

147
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
equipment and software and so on so we

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
were very excited about that and we are

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,960
eager to get this out there for users on

150
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
the internet in the future and make

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
their internet connectivity even better

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,600
so that is it shortest host presentation

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,500
ever thank you very much for coming

154
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,740

but also seriously thank you we couldn't

158
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,600
do these meetings without our sponsors

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
as you all know and i think the llc will

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
have a few words later but the host is

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
support the meeting um beyond um you

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,600

well i and you're going above and beyond

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
with making uh some some progress

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
towards getting people to see some art i

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
hear which it didn't quite work

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,199
yesterday so i know that you're very

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
sorry for that um and they're already on

176
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
the case and i try to do something so

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,639
you guys can see some art before you

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,800
leave so thank you again highly

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
appreciate it

180
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
and uh thank you to everybody else um

181
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
who made this uh meeting happen um the

182
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,360
secretariat who is sort of also going

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
above and beyond this time because

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
they're pretty heavily hit with uh covet

185
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
so if something isn't quite as smooth as

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
it normally is um it's because they are

187
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
like a lot of the third of the people

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
down compared to another weeks so

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,280
there's a lot of people who are managers

190
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
who are now

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
doing on the ground work again um and

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
it's uh i guess pretty exciting and

193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
exhilarating and uh

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,919
you guys getting your steps in every day

195
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
so that's good

196
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,039
meet echo

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
provides the service for our online

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,800
participation and i think that's become

199
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,039
a key part of what the ietf is these

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
days and we're very happy that we have a

201
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
very robust remote participation

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
facility um that together with the fee

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,039
waivers makes it possible for anybody to

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,880
just join in and participate in itf

205
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
meetings

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
the knox doing usually great job also

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
went above and beyond the hotel had some

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
challenges

209
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
i hear that cabling wasn't quite

210
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
as good as it normally is and the

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
ability to pull cables uh was not made

212
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
easy by the building itself so thank you

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,720
for that you've been debugging since

214
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
monday i think it's gotten noticeably

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,639
better already on tuesday and thank you

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
for that

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
um the llc is the financial and legal

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
home of the ietf tools team

219
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
together with the staff programmers

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
writing the data tracker and other tools

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
we use to produce the rfcs and

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
run the organization thank you to you

223
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
and the hackathon support team was great

224
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
as usual so thank you

225
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
which brings me to the ietf chair report

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
which is um

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
as usual

228
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
talk a little bit participants um we

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
have some statistics on kovid also

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,240
unfortunately during this meeting um the

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
plan for future meetings we're going to

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
talk a bit about running experiments um

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,240
brief sort of preview of other things

234
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
that is in our written report which

235
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,640
should already be online

236
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
sydney's nodding so it's available to

237
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,279
you to dig down into the details and

238
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,720
there's a brief update from the tools

239
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,839
team which i don't think we actually

240
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,000
have this time so scratch that last

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
bullet

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,839
we did a preview this morning nobody

243
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,680
noticed that we needed more coffee by

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
the way um that coffee service is

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
excellent so thank you for arranging

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
that

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,070
it's always been a cute

248
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,880
[Applause]

249
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
but i should have gone twice oh that's

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
what i learned the participant

251
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,839
statistics um we have significantly more

252
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,640
people on site compared to vienna in

253
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
vienna we're around 300 we have more

254
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
than double

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
uh that on site i think we also have

256
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
more people remote

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
keep on going okay um

258
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
so we have almost 1400 people which is a

259
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
actually a really good number i'm very

260
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
happy about that

261
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
um since we're doing fee waivers now

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
both for um in person and for remote

263
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
attendance i figured we include some

264
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,600
data for you um so we did

265
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,760
276 fee reverse and we granted

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
234 were used

267
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,120
um

268
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
for on-site fee waivers um colin and i

269
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
as the itf and irtf share we have some

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
at our discretion

271
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,200
colin typically gets a few more because

272
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
there's local academics that contact him

273
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
to attend uh he got seven requests and

274
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
granted six and i got two and i granted

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,240
one

276
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
fyi that's available but it's at our

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
discretion and you can send us email if

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
you want to use one of those in future

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
and we have 273 hackathon registrations

280
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
which is i think the usual solid number

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
i can't remember if it's

282
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
uh i think it's also a lot bigger than

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
it had been in vienna and we had 223

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
on-site and 50 remote and doing 25

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
projects it seems almost to be back at

286
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,839
pre-pandemic levels so that's really

287
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,880
great

288
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
and unsurprisingly the vast majority

289
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
this time of participants comes from the

290
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,279
us

291
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
um and then the usual smattering of

292
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
other countries and

293
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
aimed countries

294
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
it's a bit unfortunate china is such a

295
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
small sliver this time

296
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
it's mostly because of travel and of

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
time zones

298
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
you see on the next slide that

299
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
if you break this out

300
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
into on-site and remote participants

301
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
china is really sort of

302
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
mostly participating remotely hopefully

303
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
that will change by london which makes

304
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
might be a bit easier to uh to attend

305
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
for them it's closer

306
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
um but yes the the u.s is heavily

307
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
dominating the onset participation

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
and also the world participation has a

309
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
pretty sizable fraction from the u.s

310
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,040
[Music]

311
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,480
thank you

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
all right

313
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
um covet cases um so as of today we had

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
uh nine reported cases

315
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
um and uh in vienna we had nine reported

316
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,120
cases for the entire week so basically

317
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
at about doublish what we ran beyond

318
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
that which isn't necessarily surprising

319
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
given that we're also twice the people

320
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,519
right so it's actually a reasonably good

321
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
number obviously every case is one case

322
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
too many but you can never really go

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
down to zero unfortunately and as i

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
mentioned the secretariat unfortunately

325
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
makes up a large fraction of those nine

326
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,279
so they're and operating at a reduced

327
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
capacity

328
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
um there's three tests available and

329
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
they usually seem to be gone so it's

330
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
good that you guys use them keep using

331
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
them there's also free masks and

332
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
sanitizer and advil and whatever you

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
want right and if you do get infected

334
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
test positive or to have symptoms

335
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
please go to your room and contact

336
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
support itf.org and they'll take care of

337
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
you

338
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
right

339
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
this is a brief

340
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
heads up that we're going to plan on

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
asking you some questions in the post

342
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,839
meeting survey

343
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,600
um those of you who are chairs probably

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
noticed this more than others but we had

345
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
way more requests for session time for

346
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
uh 114 than we had session time

347
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,360
available and so the isg made a

348
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,560
difficult decision that we're going to

349
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
limit all working groups to at most two

350
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
hours of session time which isn't great

351
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,560
right there's many groups that could

352
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
have used more time productively and uh

353
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,160
we cut their time

354
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
that's because um when we went fully

355
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,440
online we had shorter days that made it

356
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,839
easier for online people to participate

357
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
and we kept that as we went to hybrid

358
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
meetings with in-person so the days here

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
are shorter than the days were at

360
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,279
in-person meetings pre-pandemic

361
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,880
um so

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
that's where we are right

363
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
the question is what should we do going

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
forward specifically what should we do

365
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
for hybrid meetings right and there's a

366
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
few options right we do nothing which

367
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
means we keep the short days

368
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
but we also need a key then cut session

369
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
requests in some way or form

370
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
um we could go back to longer days one

371
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
option would be to go back to the

372
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
pre-pandemic schedule

373
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
um i think if i remember correctly that

374
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
would have just about fit the request we

375
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
got for 114

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,440
but it's obviously not great for remote

377
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
participants because it makes the day

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
longer and zoom fatigue is the thing

379
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
we could add a track right we tried that

380
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
i think during one online meeting but

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
the downside is it causes conflicts

382
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
because you have now nine tracks in

383
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
parallel instead of eight and it also

384
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,440
means that every individual session

385
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
obviously gets a little bit fewer

386
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,160
participants because there's one extra

387
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
thing happening

388
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
plus

389
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,279
we contracted hotels already quite some

390
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,440
years out and it's not clear whether all

391
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
of them can support an additional track

392
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
so this is not without downsides either

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,920
and you know we could do a combination

394
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,399
of debuff or or something else and uh we

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,000
want you know want to hear from you what

396
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
you think we should do

397
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
ideally in the post-meeting survey if

398
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
you have a brilliant idea as you sit

399
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,199
here you can bring it up later at open

400
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,519
mic too but i don't want to like micro

401
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,000
engineer this here if we can avoid it so

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,399
email is good survey input is good

403
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
um we're running two experiments

404
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
one is a continuation of the rfc 8989

405
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
nomcom eligibility requirements

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,279
experiment

407
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
that rfc defined

408
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
two additional paths to become eligible

409
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,839
for the non-common addition to the

410
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
one that we had before which is

411
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
basically through meeting attendance the

412
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
additional paths are

413
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
being in leadership of a working group

414
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
or secretary or being a document author

415
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,279
it also for the

416
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,920
participation based path um

417
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
made it such that online participation

418
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
and fully online meetings counted

419
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
and that's good because otherwise we had

420
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,600
a would have a much smaller pool for

421
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
which to pull out of nominees out then

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
than we had but it ends now and so

423
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
we

424
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
decided to run the experiment again with

425
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
a small clarification and that is that

426
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
um we're going to keep

427
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,639
counting online participation

428
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
in hybrid meetings

429
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
towards establishing numcom eligibility

430
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,079
because these are the meetings like in

431
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,199
vienna and now and then probably london

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
which rfc 8999 doesn't uh

433
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,279
specifically say but it implies it

434
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
and there was a bug that the tools team

435
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,160
found

436
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,839
when they

437
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
rolled in the participation stats for i

438
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
think vienna

439
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,279
because 89.89

440
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
says that

441
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,680
online participants neither at least

442
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,759
show up in one session so use meat echo

443
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
to participate in at least one session

444
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,040
during the week

445
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
this is sort of the equivalent of the

446
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
in-person badge pickup because we also

447
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,560
take people out of the pool that

448
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
registered for in-person but the batch

449
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
doesn't get picked up all week long

450
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
and there was a bug in how the data got

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
merged and that data got fixed and the

452
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
calculation got rerun so rich is now

453
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
running with good data it has run with

454
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
good data

455
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,959
and we have a buff schedule uh

456
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
experiment where we leave some extra

457
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,759
time

458
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,839
for ads to work with both proponents on

459
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,120
getting their buff into shape

460
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
we made two announcements

461
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
the first one was related to the

462
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
experiment that i just talked about

463
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
the second one is that we instructed the

464
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
rpc to

465
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
go ahead with all archiving or 48

466
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
communications in a public archive and

467
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
there are links to the email

468
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
announcements if that's new to you you

469
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,079
want to look it up

470
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
we have no appeals and we also have no

471
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,240
ic statements and the two are not

472
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
correlated

473
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
um

474
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,640
you never know um and there's a lot more

475
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
in the written reports we purposefully

476
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
keep these short so if you if you're

477
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,039
interested in more uh information you

478
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
can go to that link and to the

479
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,799
presentations and

480
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,880
write ups that are linked from that url

481
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
and there's a blog that greg fills every

482
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
week with new things and he might hit

483
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
you up to help him write a blog about

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
whatever you're doing in the itf and if

485
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
he does that please help him out

486
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
thank you

487
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,200
and that brings us to miriam

things if you want to know more about

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,559
what the iab is doing there's a full

497
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
report already uploaded i just want to

498
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,120
mention two quick things we created two

499
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
new administrative support groups these

500
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
are just small groups that help us to do

501
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
our job and fulfill our responsibilities

502
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
one is about coordination between itf

503
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
and ieee this group always existed and

504
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
now has a data tracker home that's the

505
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,400
difference basically and the other one

506
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
is about iab and isa policy coordination

507
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
which we want to just like make sure we

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
are well aligned with isoc

509
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
yeah one nice announcement is where um

510
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
just send out a call for organizing a

511
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
workshop this workshop will be about

512
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,520
management techniques and encrypted

513
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
networks

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,919
um we want to

515
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,760
learn in this workshop what are

516
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
requirements um

517
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
in encrypted network and also for

518
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
securing management

519
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,679
that are actionable so what are the

520
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
things that we really can

521
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
change in future and who's willing to

522
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
work on these

523
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
solutions and how could those solutions

524
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
look like and that's what we want to

525
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
discuss about

526
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
if you have an idea and if you would

527
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,679
like to be invited to the workshop send

528
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,280
us your position paper

529
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
more information is on the iab website

530
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,679
and link you find here and the position

531
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,799
paper would go to us by email

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,840
this is the point where i would like to

533
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
thank some of the volunteers in the

534
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
community

535
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,039
the iab

536
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
selects a bunch of positions every time

537
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
every round every cycle and we depend

538
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
heavily on you from this community

539
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
volunteering for these positions

540
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
um we had announced or appointed some

541
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
well qualified good people and we had

542
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
like a good pool but like sometimes we

543
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
do have diversity problems so we really

544
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,200
depend on on you putting your name in or

545
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
you poking other people to put their

546
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,760
name in

547
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,160
um especially i want to thank victor for

548
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
serving on the board of trustees iso

549
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,679
board of trustees

550
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,000
victoria um for serving on the icann

551
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
nomcom committee

552
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,480
jim

553
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,200
for

554
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
the gwg

555
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
and then tim is

556
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
serving us on the ccg thank you to all

557
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
of you

558
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,240
and as i just said we're always looking

559
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
for some candidates and we have two open

560
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
calls for feedback and that's actually

561
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
the lower point on the side and you can

562
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,080
send us feedback about these you find

563
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
more information on the ib webpage

564
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
but we're also looking for a new laser

565
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
manager for

566
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,039
ice for specific iso group

567
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
this is always a little bit hard to find

568
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
because we look for people who have like

569
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
some experience in both groups but

570
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,400
effectively actually here i don't think

571
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
you have to have too much iso experience

572
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,559
you just have to be willing to learn to

573
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
go there to interact with them so if you

574
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,559
have any interest please contact us

575
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
and then this was already my last slide

576
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
this is like the exciting news we have

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,159
this time which is we're done with the

578
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
rc editor model version three it's up

579
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
and running the rc has been published

580
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
we have the rss working group and we

581
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
have two chairs thanks to pete and

582
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,280
ecker

583
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
and there was already the first meeting

584
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
on monday there's a mailing list you can

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
subscribe

586
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,159
we have the rfc series approval board

587
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
nearly together we're still looking for

588
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,880
the new rc series um consulting editor

589
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
but otherwise we already had a meeting

590
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
on monday and there's also a mailing

591
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
list that you can't subscribe to but you

592
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,760
can look at the archives if you're

593
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
really interested

594
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
um

595
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
and like from the iab side we also close

596
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,280
both of the related groups here one is

597
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
the rsoc which was previously having the

598
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,799
oversight and then the other one is a

599
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,120
program that actually did all the work

600
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
so thanks big thanks to everybody who

601
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,679
um

843
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,480
should

844
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
should be able to follow the standard

845
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
procedures and timelines that are listed

846
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
for example in the appendix

847
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,159
of the nomcom procedures rfc uh within a

848
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,919
couple of weeks but it's going to be you

849
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
know some rushing to catch up uh

850
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
how we meet where we meet as i said it's

851
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,320
all virtual um the logistics of that are

852
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,480
unclear it will all depend on the

853
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,880
geographic distribution of the committee

854
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,919
members

855
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,880
um

856
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
if everyone ends up in eastern time zone

857
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,000
uh you probably want to look at me with

858
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,760
suspicion but it'll be really convenient

859
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,279
positions opened i did send out mail

860
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,640
just before the itf um but first the

861
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
liaisons the

862
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,039
the liaisons are

863
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,200
a number of them from most of the

864
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
affected bodies like the nom-com chair

865
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,720
me

866
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,279
they don't vote on the

867
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,480
uh who is picked but they vote like me

868
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,159
on everything else

869
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,080
so the ib is colin the iesg martin duke

870
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,080
the llc is jason the it trust is

871
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,120
kathleen moriarty

872
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
and then nom-com is my predecessor gabe

873
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
montenegro who i've already had a couple

874
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,960
of meetings with to talk about how it

875
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,919
goes

876
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,600
the open positions and the job

877
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,880
descriptions

878
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,279
i sent out a tentative list of what the

879
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,880
open positions are

880
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
i think the iab had a lot of question

881
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,000
marks but the people have qualified what

882
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,559
they're planning um

883
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
they'll be in mail in the itef announce

884
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,760
mailing list and also on the com

885
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,159

912
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,359

913
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
really close coordination between uh the

914
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440

915
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
we as staff and the and the secretary in

916
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,720
planning the meeting and we're always

917
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
looking for new ways

918
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
to make the meeting experience um better

919
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
and lara's mentioned this as well

920

921
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,200
had

922
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
coffee service

was i thought really really nice so this

925
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
is just one of the ways

926
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,520
uh that we look to make the media

927
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
experience better uh with with hosts so

928

thanks again to comcast and nbc

929
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,359
universal

930
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
uh we also rely on other kinds of

931
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,720
sponsors of course

932
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,440
the

933
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
networking

934
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
uh experience here it depends on

935
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
contributions by

936
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,880
cisco and juniper and uh

937
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,000
and uh overall the webex

938
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we use in uh

939
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
making the itf work uh some thanks to

940
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
each of them uh for their contributions

941
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
to the itf

942
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,680
uh

943
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,280
also uh

944
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,680
in the last couple years we've had a new

945
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
kinds of sponsorships um akamai and

946
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,839
cisco are gold level diversity inclusion

947
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,480
sponsors and that kind of support allows

948
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
us to do new things around meetings as

949
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,920
well

950
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
so one of the things that we've just

951
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,520
started at this meeting is providing

952
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
some child care for people who may not

953
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
be able to participate or not as easily

954
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,800
participate if they uh didn't have

955
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,920
child care

956
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,680
to allow them to

957
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,520
fully engage in the meeting process and

958
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
these are just a few quotes from folks

959
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
who take advantage of it this

960
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,920
meeting we're planning to

961
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
set something up like this again for 1

962
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
15.

963
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
so if you have ideas about

964
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,920
how to support it or

965
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,320
how it can be arranged but especially if

966
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
you are the company you work for want to

967
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,680
support it please

968
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,320

it'd be great to get get those

972
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,200
expressions of interest

973

another area for sponsorship is and very

974
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,200

infrastructure

977

effort that we're taking to

983
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,040
understand

984
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
what the carbon footprint is of ietf

985
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
activities and how we might offset them

986
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
so expect more news about that later and

987
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,480

1012
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,640
it does require a lot of

1013
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
time and effort and uh

1014
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,400
probably not possible without support

1015
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,359
from the organizations

1016
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,720
uh finally these are um the secretariat

1017
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,560
and the knox staff medical staff the

1018
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,839
tools team um and llc staff of which i'm

1019
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,880
a member

1020
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
and um

1021
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,680
i think we have a really great team we

1022
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,400
all work together to pull the various

1023
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
bits of um meeting planning and

1024
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,720
executing on that plan uh that we have

1025
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
here this week

1026
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,040
uh here's a um

1027
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
slide with pictures so that you can pick

1028
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,960
us out um just imagine masks in front of

1029
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,400
most of those for those of us who are on

1030
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
site um but yeah so um

1031
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,000
this is the team that we have on the lc

1032
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
staff at the moment led of course by jay

1033
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
daly

1034
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,720
who's our executive director

1035
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,960
and uh sort of now shifting to looking

1036
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
forward we have uh

1037
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,839
amazing ongoing support from global

1038
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,079
hosts and global supporters so these are

1039
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,280
companies that are

1040
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
committed to

1041
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,720
larger or multi-year support for the

1042
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,880
ietf

1043
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
and its meetings and

1044
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,560
really they provide a

1045
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,680
level of stability that really helps us

1046
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,200
in making

1047
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
future plans

1048
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,079
work smoothly

1049
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,880

uh this is a very uh detailed and tiny

1077
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,200
and probably illegible for hard to read

1078
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,359
anyway in the in the room graph but you

1079

1081
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
dates and and venues and locations that

1082

opportunity here so

1105
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,400
uh

1106
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000

1119
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280

1127
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,160
board part of the presentation

1128
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,040
uh these are uh current board members um

1129
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,480
i think at some point we should probably

1130
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,560
update our photos these are all like

1131
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,480
pre-pandemics so lots changed

1132
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,359
and next slide so we have some upcoming

1133
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,800
board meetings these are always on our

1134
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,000
website

1135
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,640
the only note here is in august we've

1136
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,319
just learned that we have a bunch of

1137
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,319
board members on vacation so we may not

1138
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,160
have quorum that one may

1139
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
get rescheduled or we may just cancel it

1140
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,079
until the september meeting

1141
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,560
but anyone is welcome to participate we

1142
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
always have very low attendance

1143
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,040
so if you would like to ask a question

1144
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,800
or dive into a deeper

1145
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
uh part of some issue you know please do

1146
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
join we would love to have you

1147
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
so what are some of the current things

1148
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
that board's working on

1149
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
uh one of the primary things is

1150
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,760
obviously the shift from uh you know

1151
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,839
remote fully remote during the pandemic

1152
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,079
to now hybrid and so we really spent

1153
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,280
some time

1154
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,119
with the secretariat and the executive

1155
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,040
director looking at what the lessons

1156
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,760
learned were from vienna and then trying

1157
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,640
to apply those here to 114.

1158
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
um and i think we've done a great job

1159
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
especially the secretariat

1160
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,920
um the employment location for jay our

1161
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,440
executive director

1162
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,599
shifted from new zealand to the united

1163
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
kingdom as he moved to the greater

1164
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
london area

1165
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,640
these are one of those things that

1166
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,119
sounds small but is insanely complicated

1167
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,640
because of all the different

1168
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,000
tax and you know retirement and and

1169
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,040
currency exchange types of complications

1170
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,000
um we also had our annual uh strategic

1171
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,599
planning retreat and went over a bunch

1172
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,040
of issues those minutes are all

1173
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,240
published

1174
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,400
so you can see what we talked about

1175
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,640
we have been placing a lot of focus now

1176
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
that we have lee berkeley on board on

1177
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,079
the fundraising progress and this is a

1178
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,160
key area of focus we have a wonderful

1179
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,680
matching program

1180
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,960
uh courtesy of isoc and so are focused a

1181
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,319
lot on seeing some real progress there

1182
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,359
finally

1183
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,920
or not finally excuse me next we also

1184
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,800
updated our investment policy earlier in

1185
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
the year

1186
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,640
and so we started executing on those

1187
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,359
things and making some changes

1188
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,520
despite the market conditions you know

1189
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
we've had over the past few years we

1190
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,079
ended up making a lot of those decisions

1191
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,480
after one of the recent dips so you know

1192
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,319
somewhat uh good timing but i think

1193
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,200
that's more by chance than anything else

1194
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,839
certainly not our plan or

1195
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,560
or something like this just um based on

1196
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,720
the execution of those things and we're

1197
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
working with new auditors on the annual

1198
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
audit this is taking longer than

1199
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,760
expected um every few years it's a good

1200
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,000
practice to shift from one auditor to

1201
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,359
another so that they bring a different

1202
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,720
perspective

1203
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,119
um isoc recently recently changed there

1204
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,640
has recommended a new one for us so

1205
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,880
we've been following that and we hope to

1206
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
have that audit uh published very very

1207
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,599
soon and we know our partners that are

1208
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,000
isaac are eager for that as well

1209
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,319
and finally we did provide some feedback

1210
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,800
to the ietf trust on their restructuring

1211
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,240
consultation

1212
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,800
and we published that in at least one of

1213
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,240
our recent meeting minutes so you can

1214
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,040
see exactly what we had sent to them

1215
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,920
um

1216
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,800
in their process

1217
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,480
now onto budget um there continues to be

1218
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
considerable uncertainty in our

1219
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,599
operating model primarily because it's

1220
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,920
very hard to predict how many people

1221
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
will want to or be able to come to a

1222
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,680
meeting and so the registration numbers

1223
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,079
or the revenues are heavily driven

1224
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,480
by attendance and so um there's

1225
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
uncertainty around this and we've also

1226
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,359
found

1227
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,359
that um i'm sure as you have for

1228
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,599
traveling here that the cost travel has

1229
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,560
risen as well uh post-pandemic

1230
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,560
and so all of those costs show up in in

1231
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,319
in our bottom line as well

1232
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,599
and so we're working through that

1233
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,839
uncertainty we're hoping that as the

1234
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,480
budget for next year um gets developed

1235
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,000
later this year that maybe we have a

1236
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,760
little bit better sense of it but

1237
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,920
unfortunately we are all

1238
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,760
subject to the sort of whims of what's

1239
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
happening with the coronavirus

1240
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,960
the um availability of you know travel

1241
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,119
companies the pricing of hotel rooms and

1242
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,160
so on

1243
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,079
um and we have a bunch of knock-on

1244
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,560
effects so when we have lower numbers of

1245
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,960
room bookings we get lower uh sort of

1246
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,800
meeting fees back from hotels and you

1247
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,560
know so it's sort of a a bunch of

1248
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,400
different things and then the primary

1249
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,640
thing is really the the investment loss

1250
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,559
now the good news here

1251
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,119
such as it is i suppose is that we lost

1252
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,760
less than the average market participant

1253
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,079
um so i guess that's a good thing our

1254
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,000
our balanced investment

1255
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,839
strategy paid off and preserved a great

1256
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
deal of capital but again we also had

1257
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,240
these sort of a couple of random things

1258
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,800
that happened the first was that the the

1259
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
first tranche of investments that we

1260
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,880
made when we turned the cash we had from

1261
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,920
isoc and and put that into investments

1262
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,240
in the market happened immediately after

1263
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,000
the first stock market dip as the

1264
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,680
pandemic occurred so that was like good

1265
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,599
timing number two one

1266
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,280
good timing number two was the recent

1267
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,200
decision to make some shifts

1268
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,319
um that was also beneficial but um you

1269
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,240
know we're doing as well as we can and

1270
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,119
you know

1271
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,079
i i wish my 401k was doing as well as

1272
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,240
our investments here probably be a

1273
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,800
welcome thing for my family

1274
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480

we're here to stay out of your way but

1290
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,040
sometimes we can't quite do it that well

1291
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,520
so the trust

1292
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,920
there this is what the trust is here to

1293
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,640
do

1294
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,559
we manage the ip assets the intellectual

1295
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,400
property assets

1296
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,920
of the ietf and related well because

1297
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,559
related is we have some things for ayana

1298
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,480
and trademarks so we we keep track of

1299
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,000
the trademarks and make sure they're

1300
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,359
registered and

1301
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,720

1302
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,160
we hold the copyrights for the ietf for

1303
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,160
the rfcs

1304
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,000
we do so according to the rules that

1305
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,559
were laid out by the ietf to make sure

1306
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,119
the ietf can do its job that's what

1307
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,200
we're here to do

1308
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,000
and we don't hold any patents and we

1309
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,880
don't want to hold any patents that's

1310
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,240
not our job

1311
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,200
we also for the llc hold the licenses

1312
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,520
there's a separate plaque that'll get

1341
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,119
mailed to you but they've asked me to

1342
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,200
hold this one up for now

1343
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,800
there is a plaque for you to thank you

1344
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
for your service

1345
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,520
because we really do appreciate it

1346
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,880
well you know we appreciate it in fact

1347
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,200
we got a hat special for you wow

1348
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,040
as far as we know the only one in

1349
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,119
existence

1350
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,599
it goes with my ietf mask exactly

1351
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,640
thank you john

1352
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,319
so

1353
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,000
the the question is has the trust dale

1354
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,839
anything you guys care about

1355
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,079
you have heard probably repeatedly we

1356
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,480
talked about it at the last plenary and

1357
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,160
we did hold a consultation to the

1358
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,960
community about it we've been trying to

1359
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,119
restructure to fix a historical artifact

1360
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,839
historically the trust is set up

1361
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,720
literally as a trust in virginia

1362
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,640
and that causes a

1363
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,559
number of problems

1364
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,200
and we wanted to restructure as a

1365
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,920
delaware nonprofit corporation

1366
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,720
still called the ietf trust

1367
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,400
we don't want to have to go fix all the

1368
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,440
documents to talk about the itf trust so

1369
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,520
we've checked and we think legally we

1370
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,839
can still be called the ietf trust and

1371
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,880
just be a delaware nonprofit corporation

1372
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,720
we brought in a separate set of lawyers

1373
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
who special who were in a good position

1374
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,880
to help us with this and we held a

1375
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,599
community consultation on this there is

1376
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
all the material that was available on

1377
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,040
the links

1378
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,960
so you can go look at it if you still

1379
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,559
have questions about why we're doing it

1380
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,559
please get in touch

1381
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,400
um we very much appreciate the folks who

1382
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,200
joined the webex and who sent questions

1383
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,760
on email and even the feedback from the

1384
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,960
llc we appreciate everybody's

1385
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,480
uh comments

1386
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,520
we have concluded that consultation oops

1387
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,599
i was right there we're still on this

1388
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,559
slide

1389
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,880
um and we have put out an email that

1390
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,359
says yes as far as we can tell this is

1391
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,800
still the right thing to do and we're

1392
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,640
going to go ahead and do it

1393
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,359
and unless somebody tells us something

1394
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,680
we completely missed

1395
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,440
probably next week we'll actually tell

1396
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,400
the lawyers go file the paperwork but i

1397
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,800
mean if we've missed something tell us

1398
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,599
but we really because our job is to make

1399
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,599
things work for you as i said we really

1400
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,040
want to be out of your way we're just

1401
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,160
told us to make things work

1402
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,000
um one interesting thing that was

1403
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,480
brought to us first by staff but has now

1404
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,839
started coming up from other parts of

1405
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,440
the community are these

1406
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,640
ietf supporter and protocol badges

1407
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,400
these little badges that people want to

1408
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,559
be able to use on web pages or on other

1409
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,240
things to say

1410
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,480
i support this activity or i support the

1411
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,160
ietf

1412
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,559
and we worked with

1413
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,720
our lawyers on

1414
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,480
what is the licensing we can do to make

1415
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,200
this available as minimally with the

1416
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,680
minimally invasive as possible

1417
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,760
and so see the website for the exact

1418
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,000
terms but there are these now licenses

1419
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,920
that can be these these badges that can

1420
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,240
be used to say i support quick or i

1421
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,000
support the itf

1422
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,839
um they're doing another one i think for

1423
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,559
l4s that they've asked us to approve and

1424
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,160
we're working with them to get the final

1425
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,359
details on that one sorted out so if

1426
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,520
we're happy to do this and we hold the

1427
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,680
copyright so that there's no question

1428
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,240
about where they live and that way we

1429
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,079
publish the licensing information for it

1430
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,240
and those are the links for contacting

1431
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,680
us

1432
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,559
and

1433
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,440
i'll be here for the rest of the week so

1434
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
and most of the trustees are here so

1435
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,400
thank you very much

1436
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,780
[Applause]

1437
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,640
thank you joe um

1438
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,640
this is a the sad part of this plenary

1439
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,359
because we had two um longtime community

1440
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,720
members who have been long-time

1441
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,119
participants and really drove different

1442
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,880
parts of indian technology passed away

1443
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,720
in in recent months i think both of them

1444
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,599
since

1445
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,520
um

1446
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,720
itf-113 in vienna

1447
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,040
and i asked um two people who knew them

1448
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,520
very well to say a few words so first

1449
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,240
we're going to have a

1450
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,160
video from nathaniel borenstein who's

1451
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,000
going to talk about his friend ned freed

1452
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,599
it would be reasonable for me to talk

1453
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,200
about ned freed

1454
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,040
and mention only his contributions to

1455
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,440
the ietf iab

1456
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,000
iesg and diana

1457
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,960
and particularly his 50 rfcs

1458
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,680
but while ned and i are best known as

1459
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,359
partners in mime

1460
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,680
what i treasure more than the results of

1461
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
our collaboration

1462
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,799
is that we worked together for years

1463
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,200
without a single argument

1464
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,559
hard to believe

1465
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,559
one or two aspects of mime embarrassed

1466
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,000
me to this day

1467
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,280
but we were even united in our mistakes

1468
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,480
at least i thought so um but ned was

1469
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,079
honestly so

1470
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,799
pragmatic and sunny and smooth that

1471
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,400
he might have won arguments i never knew

1472
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,760
we were having

1473
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,839
i think he was a perfect fit for ietf

1474
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,078
work

1475
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,240
then i both shared an interest in them

1476
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,920
in how internet technology might help

1477
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,839
the disabled that's one of the reasons

1478
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,400
we have multi-part alternative

1479
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,480
a few years after mime

1480
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,160
i got to tell him that at the launch of

1481
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,160
my startup first virtual

1482
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,920
almost nobody knew that our entire

1483
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,160
email-based help department was a

1484
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
brilliant young quadriplegic man john

1485
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,760
ferguson

1486
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,440
ned always smiled easily but when he

1487
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,280
heard that he looked as happy as the

1488
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,319
father of a newborn

1489
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,280
then in later years when his own health

1490
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,960
precluded travel

1491
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,160
he chose to eat the ietf's dog food

1492
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,440
he proved

1493
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,839
uh to early skeptics even within our

1494
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:22,960
community

1495
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,599
that our technology allows a great mind

1496
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,000
to be a leader from thousands of miles

1497
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,680
away

1498
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,599
ned freed helped design and build a

1499
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,079
world where great minds can transcend

1500
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,440
limited bodies

1501
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,400
and then he demonstrated it

1502
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,839
rest in peace old friend

1503
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,960
to give us a moment while we reshared a

1504
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,280
slight deck

1505
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,960
we have too many slides

1506
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,880
we are just a

1507
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,480
participant who passed away recently

1508
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,040
with stephen kassner and eve schuler is

1509
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,200
online to talk about her collaboration

1510
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,160
with steven eve go ed

1511
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,839
thanks so much thanks for this

1512
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,760
opportunity to say a few words about

1513
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,000
steve he was a long-time friend

1514
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,760
colleague and mentor to many of us

1515
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
within the ietf community and for those

1516
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,760
of you who may not have had the pleasure

1517
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,520
of knowing steve directly

1518
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,799
his vision and leadership were

1519
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,960
instrumental to the success of itf

1520
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,040
multimedia standards and protocols that

1521
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,359
have driven the success of ip based

1522
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,599
telephony and multimedia conferencing as

1523
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,760
well as other real-time multicast and

1524
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,920
unicast applications

1525
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,160
he began that journey at occidental

1526
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,799
college graduating in 1973 with a degree

1527
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,559
in mathematics and then obtaining a

1528
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,040
master's in computer science from usc in

1529
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,559
1976

1530
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,359
but beginning in 1974 he joined usc's

1531
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,079
information sciences institute and he

1532
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,359
contributed to the design and

1533
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,880
implementation

1534
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,720
of the earliest experiments with packet

1535
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,640
voice on the arpanet and thus

1536
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,240
contributed to the publication of the

1537
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,040
network voice protocol rfc 741 published

1538
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,720
in 1977 that's a year before the tcpip

1539
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,640
split and a year before udp was defined

1540
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,880
as higher bandwidth packet satellite and

1541
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,640
terrestrial networks became operational

1542
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,440
in the 1980s he led the project at isi

1543
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,520
to develop and deploy packet video over

1544
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,240
those networks

1545
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,960
and steve's first participation in ietf

1546
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,760
meetings was documented as being 1988

1547
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,799
attending ietf number 11. and as many of

1548
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,640
you may recall his lovely wife of 40

1549
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,880
years karen kastner often attended itf

1550
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,400
meetings with him

1551
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,480
steve went on to found the audio video

1552
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,119
transport working group abt and served

1553
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,680
it as its chair from 1991 until 2003. he

1554
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,559
authored 15 rfcs and in particular was

1555
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,640
an author and the principal editor of

1556
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,880
the real-time transport protocol rtp

1557
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,240
specification

1558
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,960
beginning in 1992 he was the primary

1559
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,599
organizer of the movement to establish

1560
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,000
the m-bone an experimental virtual

1561
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
network overlaying the internet for

1562
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,760
broadcast of audio video using multicast

1563
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,280
ip and rtp based applications it enabled

1564
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,280
live streaming of ietf meetings

1565
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,200
including return audio from remote

1566
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,119
participants and in many ways was the

1567
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,960
precursor to our hybrid meet echo

1568
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,640
meetings as well as the multitude of

1569
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,160
video conferencing apps in our lives

1570
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,559
today the mbon also carried the first

1571
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,880
internet radio broadcasts

1572
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
provided audio chat rooms for network

1573
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,920
geeks streamed nasa tv of the first

1574
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,240
hubble repair broadcasted a rolling

1575
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,160
stones concert resulting in a newsweek

1576
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,079
article boldly displaying steve van

1577
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,920
jacobson and steve deering as our modern

1578
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,440
day superheroes

1579
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,520
and demonstrating the first distributed

conference

1583
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,680
in 1995 steve took his expertise into

1584
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,440
the commercial arena to further develop

1585
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,359
conferencing and streaming applications

1586
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,280
at precept software later acquired by

1587
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,599
cisco in 1998 where he was a

1588
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,079
distinguished engineer and from 2000

1589
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,119
until retiring in 2014 he shifted gears

1590
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,319
to work on network performance

1591
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,319
measurement and routing analysis as a

1592
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,559
fellow at packet design

1593
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,319
in retirement he continued to work on

1594
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,079
various projects such as volunteering

1595
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,599
for the computer history museum to

1596
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,720
produce an operational emulation of the

1597
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,480
1960s era ibm 1620 computer the room

1598
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,160
size computer where he first got his

1599
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,880
start in coding as an undergrad at oxy

1600
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,480
as a brilliant engineer steve also

1601
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,920
enjoyed sharing his creations with

1602
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,400
others one of the more unique ones being

1603
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,359
his solid state digital monopoly game

1604
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,960
that he first showcased at the pc

1605
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,839
festival in anaheim in 1978.

1606
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,720
steve also was an early early adopter of

1607
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,880
electric vehicle technology not

1608
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,280
surprisingly he enjoyed helping debug

1609
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,599
the early tesla roadster model before it

1610
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,480
was even released to the public

1611
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,920
for those of you who had the privilege

1612
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,839
to work with steve you know firsthand

1613
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,480
that he had an encyclopedic knowledge

1614
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,119
about anything and everything which he

1615
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,960
became involved and he enjoyed being a

1616
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,799
keeper of the pre-history of the

1617
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,480
internet's evolution towards packet

1618
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,960
audio and video his attention to detail

1619
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,599
was unrivaled by anyone i have ever met

1620
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,599
and his meticulousness

1621
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,599
motivated those of us lucky enough to

1622
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,280
collaborate with him to bring our best

1623
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,680
selves to the tasks at hand in addition

1624
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,520
to his wisdom steve was the consummate

1625
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,400
role model for quiet leadership humility

1626
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,760
and kindness

1627
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,520
steve passed away on the morning of july

1628
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,280
4th 2022 an auspicious date in the u.s

1629
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,680
celebrated as independence day

1630
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,520
and i couldn't help but imagine when the

1631
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,839
fireworks began in the evening that the

1632
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,319
fireworks were celebrating steve's life

1633
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,680
all that he accomplished and all the

1634
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,480
people whose lives he touched i want to

1635
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,599
close

1636
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,599
by paraphrasing some wise words penned

1637
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,680
by colin perkins when he nominated steve

1638
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,839
for the internet award and i quote

1639
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,319
steve has long provided an example of

1640
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,400
how an ietf working group chair should

1641
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,720
act with humility and fairness while

1642
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,400
building on a deep understanding of the

1643
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,839
underlying technology and systems

1644
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,039
architecture

1645
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,039
he saw consensus where none seemed

1646
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,039
possible and he would patiently listen

1647
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,200
to all sides of an argument identify

1648
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,119
concerns and correct misunderstandings

1649
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,440
of the architecture and quietly

1650
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,920
carefully respectfully help the working

1651
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,520
group come to consensus end quote

1652
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,359
in conclusion and to echo the sentiments

1653
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,039
of the many people who reached out to me

1654
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,119
after my posting to the itf list about

1655
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,559
steve's passing

1656
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,240
it was truly a gift to have worked with

1657
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,119
him

1658
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,400
steve you will be sorely missed

1659
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,760

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,839
condolences to his family to know

1661
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,839
further details about the memorial to be

1662
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,319
held in august or to donate to the

1663
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,119
endowed chair in cs that he and karen

1664
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,359
seated with the honorarium from the ieee

1665
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,280
award and it was established for the

1666
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,440
newly created cs department at his alma

1667
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,720

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,720
please reach out to me and thank you

1669
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,160
again for giving me this time

1670
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,240
thank you

1671
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,680
um i'd like to ask for a moment of

1672
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,960
silence for stephen and ned

1673
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,839
thank you

1674
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,200
shifting gears

1675
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
it's time for open mic

1676
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,000
as the isg makes their way to the stage

1677
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,520
please remember that if you want to ask

1678
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,960
questions to use the meat echo cue

1679
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,799
from which i'm going to remove eve now

1680
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,799
if i can find the button

1681
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,480
um

1682
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,920
but first since we have the opportunity

1683
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,119
to have many

1684
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,039
ids in person we're going to go down the

1685
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,119
podium and introduce ourselves

1686
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,079
since i'm

1687
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,599
standing i'm going to start with myself

1688
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,319
and last i gotta share the itf and i

1689

okay that's us and uh

1704
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,319
the queue looks empty from up here

1705
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,920
oh there's someone in line adrian go

1706

thank you

1708
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,240
or maybe not

1709
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,640
thank you adrian farrell

1710
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,680
um i'm i'm very appreciative of uh the

1711
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,000
work that the isg does and i i know

1712
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,240
what's involved and and how much effort

1713
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,359
there is

1714
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,799
um

1715
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,200
i'm also definitely not pointing fingers

1716
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,359
here but i suppose if the if the hat

1717
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,319
fits

1718
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,680
uh wear it

1719
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,400
uh does the isg have a reasonable

1720
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,119
expectation for how long

1721
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,960
it should take absent exceptional

1722
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,079
circumstances and vacations and

1723
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,359
unresponsive

1724
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,119
authors and so on

1725
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,440
for a document to

1726
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,319
move from publication request to

1727
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,359
uh

1728
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,839
ietf last call

1729
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,400
if so what does the isg do to monitor

1730
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,880
that and move documents along

1731
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,480
and if not

1732
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,039
would the isg like to consider

1733
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,720
setting the expectations of the

1734
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,880
community

1735
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,559
thanks for the question adrian so the

1736
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,720
isg is monitoring this but as you might

1737
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,559
imagine or as you know from first in

1738
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,319
experience that the load is somewhat

1739
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,680
bursty and also differs quite a bit

1740
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,119
between the areas

1741
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,839
um and so it's more of a question for

1742
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,520
how does individual areas how do they

1743
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,880
manage their queue

1744
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,640
and for routing for example right we

1745
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,559
added a while ago a third area director

1746
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,079
to help with the processing of the

1747
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,000
documents because routing had quite a

1748
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,039
burst

1749
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,359
come for several years

1750
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,280
the data tracker is a good tool so each

1751
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,599
ad as you probably know has a dashboard

1752
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,280
where they can keep track of which

1753
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,440
documents are in which state

1754
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,640
um and at the code sprint earlier on

1755
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,120
saturday tarot given and actually works

1756
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,560
on

1757
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,839
giving an aggregated view both of the

1758
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,158
isg internally but also to the public

1759
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,040
where you can see isd white stats on on

1760
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,279
how the document queue is progressing

1761
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,120
so i don't have a firm answer for you i

1762
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,158
know the data tracker has some

1763
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,759
aspirational dates

1764
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,679
but they're not per area and they're

1765
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,198
also

1766
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,799
somewhat outdated

1767
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,238
i would expect that i think if you

1768
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,960
remember that we

1769
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,319
without looking it up i think we said

1770
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,120
it's about a week or two for 80 review

1771
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,479
then it's the last call which is

1772
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,560
typically two weeks

1773
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,920
it might take another week or two to get

1774
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,600
it on the ballot

1775
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,679
and then it's a question of how long if

1776
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,520
any discussions happen they take to

1777
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
resolve and that's probably the most

1778
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,359
variable factor

1779
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,439
so it can take several weeks

1780
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,198
to get it moving onwards or it can take

1781
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,839
a lot longer

1782
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,439
so i'll just add thank you for not

1783
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,319
pointing any fingers and um

1784
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,198
i

1785
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,960
don't have any more concrete answers

1786
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,759
than what lars replied except to say

1787
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,439
that i think that your questions are

1788
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,839
good questions and that they're ones

1789
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,158
that i think that we will take up

1790
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,719
amongst ourselves and perhaps have some

1791
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,640
more concrete answers at some point in

1792
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,000
the future after we've had a chance to

1793
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,279
discuss

1794
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,239
and thank you for asking

1795
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,080
yeah and i think actually there is

1796
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,359
something in the data track which is

1797
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,520
sort of an aspirational thing of like 14

1798
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,319
days or something but i know sometimes a

1799
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,399
document arrives and it's possible to

1800
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,839
miss the email

1801
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,238
so you know if something ends up

1802
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,158
anywhere ever stuck in the process it

1803
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,000
never hurts to just drop the idea note

1804
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
being like just wanted to make sure

1805
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,199
for example i had a document a couple of

1806
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,280
weeks ago which somehow completely fell

1807
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,480
through the cracks and i just didn't

1808
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,239
notice it was sitting i hadn't seen it

1809
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,920
for like three weeks till somebody poked

1810
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,719
me

1811
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:09,760
and

1812
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,040
you know sometimes things do just look

1813
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,239
okay

1814
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,719
so there is also

1815
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,400
when we do an earlier review right we

1816
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,719
basically ask the authors to make a

1817
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,719
revised it takes time as well right so

1818
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,640
it's not only there and sometimes as

1819
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,360
well it depends to me for ldd

1820
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,679
and and drip i want to make a cluster of

1821
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,760
documents because they make reference to

1822
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,920
each other so it makes easier for the

1823
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,640
isg to review them together

1824
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,320
and for the authors to change it up

1825
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,239
together as well so sometimes there are

1826
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,159
delays like this

1827
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,839
but you're right it should be short

1828
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,480
so thank you um

1829
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,440
maybe put notes in the history tab when

1830
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,920
when you know that there's something so

1831
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,360
that people can look and see what's

1832
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,560
going on

1833
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,080
yep that's a good suggestion thank you

1834
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,199
no one else

1835
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,719
anybody remote looking for the button

1836
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,040
still

1837
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,199
come on we walked all the way up there

1838
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,440
there must be some questions okay

1839
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,559
please some question for warren

1840
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,520
well your wish got granted david go

1841
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,760
ahead

1842
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,840
this won't end well

1843
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,400
david's kanazi i see i have a reputation

1844
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,080
warren what did you think of the cookies

1845
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,480
this week

1846
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,920
i think that the chocolate ones were

1847
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,159
really big but kind of soft and actually

1848
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,120
they were kind of difficult to eat

1849
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,640
because like the white and the brown

1850
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,719
chocolate would come out so other than

1851
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,920
that and it would also be good if there

1852
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,120
were some that were like oatmeal raisin

1853
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,560
i there were actually some oatmeal

1854
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,400
raisins one today they were pretty good

1855
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,480
really i guess you ate them all then

1856
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,560
sorry

1857
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,239
thank you warren

1858
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,199
so

1859
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,640
i was gonna say if there's nobody else

1860
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,480
we have enough time for the iab to get a

1861
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,840
lot of questions but rich is in the

1862
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,679
queue so go ahead rich

1863
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,600

1864
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,239

1865
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,199
out or want to get out um is there

1866
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,440
anything the community can do to help

1867
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,480
you look for incoming volunteers to take

1868
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,880
your position

1869
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,199
actually i don't question yeah i was

1870
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,640
hoping somebody would mention something

1871
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,679
about that

1872
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,239
i mean i know i would be very happy to

1873
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,320
chat with anybody who's in any way

1874
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,040
interested in running for ops 80

1875
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,640
i think it's fun

1876
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,520
um

1877
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,840
and you know it's really interesting if

1878
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,920
anybody isn't anywhere interested please

1879
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,360
come and chat with me

1880
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,480
i will be around drop me email etc and

1881
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,800
i'm assuming that most other ads have a

1882
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,640
similar view you know

1883
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,320
talk to them about our cd as well

1884
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,560
yeah i mean to reiterate what uh warren

1885
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,840
said we've talked about this at the

1886
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,520
retreat and thinking of a pipeline thank

1887
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,600
you for the question we welcome the

1888
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,679
community to come to engage us

1889
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,560
what i'd probably say is the areas are

1890
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,400
both similar and kind of different and

1891
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,920
so there's commonality of the role and

1892
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,520
there's differences in the role so

1893
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,960
probably for approaching in the area

1894
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,320
you're interested in is the place to

1895
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,400
start certainly in security welcome

1896
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,839
engagement thanks

1897
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,120
and the same goes for the transport area

1898
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,040
of course and where and roman and say

1899
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,800
they are enough i don't want to remind

1900
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,360
you guys but yeah please come and talk

1901
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,440
with us

1902
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,440
and i think like i just add that like a

1903
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,840
common fear is often about the time

1904
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
commitment and there certainly is a time

1905
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,159
commitment um it is not something to do

1906
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,760
in the margins of your job but at the

1907
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,440
same time it is kind of what you make it

1908
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,360
and it can expand and contract with the

1909
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,040
time you have available

1910
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,120
so um please don't let that be a barrier

1911
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,600
and please talk to somebody before you

1912
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,679
dismiss the possibility on that basis

1913
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,760
and it's not sort of so visible to the

1914
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,520
community but but most 80s actually

1915
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,000
actively worry about succession and

1916
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,920
building a leadership pipeline basically

1917
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,920
when they start a job right because you

1918
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,239
you do want to be able to leave it with

1919
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,560
somebody who can continue the work and

1920
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,760
and so this this sort of basically

1921
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,600
the new incoming ids right that was a

1922
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,239
discussion we had pretty early on uh in

1923
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,239
in march or april like how do you do

1924
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,480
this and so when they write it if

1925
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,679
there's anybody who's interested in

1926
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,600
serving on any of these bodies frankly

1927
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,320
not just the isg but also ib or llc talk

1928
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,840
to the people who is currently sitting

1929
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,679
and then we're more than happy to answer

1930
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,520
any questions you might have

1931
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
um please please do so we got to give

1932
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,840
nomcom a good slate to uh select from

1933
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,199
and i mean also you know include

1934
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,400
questions like

1935
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,920
how did you manage to convince your

1936
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,080
employer to support you which is one of

1937
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,000
the common problems i hear things like

1938
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,159
that sort of when you got appointed how

1939
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,520
did you make it so management would

1940
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,560
support you

1941
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,960
um which are the good bits etc

1942
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,440
i was just going to add one general con

1943
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,199
thing up here to say that although the

1944
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,360
job is challenging it is also very

1945
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,159
rewarding so if you're considering doing

1946
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,840
this i would definitely try and

1947
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,080
encourage anyone to give it a go and

1948
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,760
apply

1949
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,719
so that's my view

1950
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,480
all right

1951
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,760
trolls is turtle's remote or in person

1952
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,400
no no the the

1953
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,320
the unmute button was hard to find um

1954
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,080
yeah when it comes to the leadership

1955
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,159
there was also i think last time the

1956
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,120
question raised about um you know um the

1957
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,960
working group chairs and some

1958
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,520
observations being made about

1959
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,800
old duplicate triple quadruple working

1960
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,040
group chairs was was that topic ever

1961
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,679
gotten to a point where the isg had some

1962
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,040
opinions or thoughts on this

1963
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,120
so i don't think the isg has discussed

1964
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,400
this um

1965
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,920
at the isg level i think individual

1966
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,920
areas are sort of constantly looking at

1967
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,960
what

1968
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,600
chairperson ships their groups need and

1969
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,760
um that there's another leadership

1970
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,120
pipeline that that just needs to be

1971
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,920
maintained and built right so are you um

1972
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,360
give specific concerns about some

1973
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,719
working groups are you saying that we

1974
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,000
have too many chairs for some or too few

1975
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,560
no i i i think uh if i remember

1976
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,400
correctly one of the concerns raised was

1977
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,640
that we have several cases of uh

1978
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,440
individuals serving on uh you know i

1979
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,920
think up to four working groups and that

1980
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,400
that might be an opportunity you know

1981
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,120
instead of just waiting for um you know

1982
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,520
somebody to fully expire to broaden the

1983
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,159
basis by bringing more young blood in

1984
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,320
god got it thanks for clarifying i i

1985
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,159
misunderstood your question initially so

1986
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,840
yeah we did actually discuss this sort

1987
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,920
of um it's not really a problem but this

1988
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,440
sort of case where you have chairs that

1989
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,480
serve for a long time sometimes decades

1990
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,080
because it does sort of in a certain

1991
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,520
technology area

1992
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,600
um quote unquote block

1993
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,920
the ability for somebody new to

1994
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,480
rise up right and um we didn't really

1995
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,440
conclude um isg white i personally

1996
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,880
decided that whenever we charter

1997
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,800
something i just you know bug the

1998
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,040
recharging id and say hey would this be

1999
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,560
a good time to roll in some new chairs

2000
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,320
and then we have a discussion

2001
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,560
so i choose to handle it that way uh but

2002
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,040
each id does something individually

2003
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,600
and then and i wasn't specifically

2004
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,239
talking about the the length of time in

2005
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,320
in a position but just the accumulation

2006
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,040
of of roles

2007
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,040
so yeah actually an ops i've been trying

2008
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,360
fairly hard to find a third chair for

2009
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,560
many of the

2010
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,040
many of the working groups um largely so

2011
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,400
we can bring in somebody who hasn't

2012
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,840
chaired before or somebody who's

2013
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,000
somewhat newer to the ietf

2014
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,159
to serve as a third chair gain some

2015
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,320
experience sort of see how it goes and

2016
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,640
then maybe they transition into being

2017
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,480
one of the two sorry i'm not sure if i

2018
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,400
make myself clear i was i was i was

2019
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,040
talking about specifically the overload

2020
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,440
of persons by having to chair up to four

2021
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,000
working groups

2022
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,600
that that was the concern that was

2023
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,280
originally brought up

2024
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,520
yeah

2025
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,440
and when i do hear that concern

2026
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,000
sometimes it's just hard to find people

2027
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,600
who are willing to chair certain working

2028
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,040
groups as well

2029
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,719
you know as a as a separate right

2030
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,600
uh let me add to that we've done this

2031
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,520
repeatedly uh over the last couple days

2032
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,360
we really always are looking for people

2033
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,360
to take on new active roles so even if

2034
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,719
you're a newcomer

2035
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,239
if you're interested in sharing if

2036
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,080
you're interested in becoming a document

2037
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,880
shepherd we really need those people

2038
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,960
and be really happy to help especially

2039
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,360
new people integrating and becoming part

2040
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,520
of it and the more new people we get the

2041
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,840
more we can avoid having chairs you know

2042
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,440
the same chairs on four different groups

2043
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,239
so

2044
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,000
please reach out to

2045
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,080
to to us on on the

2046
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,840
now usg to uh to volunteer

2047
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,719
and the same thing in my case right so

2048
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,880
i try very hard to get

2049
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
shepherd that are not the working group

2050
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,679
chair

2051
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,040
is demanding

2052
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,120
um and there is one andrew in the room

2053
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,640
that we recognize himself did a great

2054
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,840
job because shepherds

2055
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,520
basically a way to learn how the

2056
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,280
processes works so you are more

2057
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,120
confident to accept a working group

2058
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,000
chair

2059
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,560
and you have seen the amount of boss we

2060
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,120
have the last two iatf meaning creating

2061
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,199
new working groups where we need new

2062
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,679
chair that's really where

2063
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,920
we all try to get an

2064
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,679
let's say a senior

2065
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,880
or spirit experience chair together with

2066
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,280
somebody who was maybe a shepherd before

2067
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,440
and simply giving the opportunity to

2068
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,600
learn on the job because there is no

2069
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,199
working group chair school right or we

2070
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,800
can book your universities to learn it

2071
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,400
on the job

2072
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,360
so

2073
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,520
if somebody you see a document

2074
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,760
the chair asking for a shepherd

2075
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,480
please step forward

2076
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,120
um in in art at least we we very much

2077
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,040
like this whole model of experienced

2078
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,639
chair with an inexperienced chair to try

2079
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,280
to breed new uh new talent for for the

2080
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,639
so that we don't have the repetition

2081
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,400
problem that we see we're already

2082
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,679
talking about it for some of the boss

2083
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,920
that we held today where can we get that

2084
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,360
sort of pairing can we identify that's

2085
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,560
repairing so

2086
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,239
um we're sensitive to the problem and

2087
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,080
we're trying to solve it as early in the

2088
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,080
process as we can

2089
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,360
um i can also just from my side echo

2090
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,440
what was said there um

2091
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,159
and in fact in one of the working groups

2092
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,760
that will be shortly charted that's

2093
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,080
exactly what we've done a senior per

2094
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,239
appearing with someone who hasn't shared

2095
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,040
before and that way we can raise more

2096
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,239
people up

2097
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,920
rather than just increasing the

2098
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,080
duplication on people

2099
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,000
so i'm very supportive of that model as

2100
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,239
well

2101
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,840
okay let's go to barry

2102
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,440
this is barry lieber i want to sort of

2103
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,920
tie in adrian's question and warren's

2104
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,679
response to it with eric's response here

2105
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,120
that

2106
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,280
part of it is that the shepherd

2107
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,520
who writes up the shepherd right up and

2108
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,000
often steps aside and does nothing else

2109
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,840
should be the one who's following the

2110
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,719
document through the rest of the process

2111
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,199
and should be the one who says hey one

2112
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,199
you dropped this one

2113
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,800
what's going on

2114
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,719
so this is a word to the shepherds not a

2115
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,639
question to the isg

2116
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,719
please stay active through the rest of

2117
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,560
the life of the document and make sure

2118
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,880
things keep moving along and that you

2119
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,920
unclog things that need it

2120
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,520
thank you that's exactly correct that's

2121
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,480
the role of the shepherd

2122
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,800
and this only learned the process

2123
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,840
from a to z

2124
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,719
i've uh

2125
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,719
commented on ballots recently that the

2126
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,239
shepherd write up for example does not

2127
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,520
get due attention it's kind of like

2128
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,719
let's get this out of the way and just

2129
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,159
get it done and that's kind of where the

2130
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,320
we stopped hearing from the shepherd i'm

2131
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,679
trying to encourage more thorough

2132
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,400
handling from there

2133
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,040
any other questions for the isg

2134
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,270
thank you that brings us to the iab

2135

01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,120
think of the cookies this time

2164
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,440
you know i really enjoyed the

2165
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,840
oatmeal raisin ones today personally i

2166
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,480
had two i had to stop after that

2167
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,560
but maybe there's still some more i

2168
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,520
should have had more i'm sad now

2169
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,760
i didn't have to sing a cookie

2170
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,400
but that's a different story that might

2171
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,280
be caused for an appeal

2172
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,159
eric

2173
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,920
so the question for david if you don't

2174
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,840
mind david what do you think about the

2175
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,239
coffee

2176
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,840
you know my general take on coffee is

2177
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,239
that it keeps me awake and it did its

2178
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,320
job so i don't actually know how to tell

2179
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,320
what is good coffee or not but this one

2180
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,600
kept me awake which is hard at itf

2181
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,360
pretty true

2182
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,159
i had a good friend that has this theory

2183
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,320
that bad coffee from like you know a

2184
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,320
7-11 or mini-mart is actually the best

2185
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,480
way to drive because while the caffeine

2186
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,400
is taking a while to hit in the bad

2187
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,519
taste keeps you awake

2188
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,320
you see the iep is very busy

2189
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,000
this was enough time to actually prep

2190
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,040
your question a real question

2191
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,520
no well thank you that's pretty see

2192
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,840
we have somebody

2193
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,560
uh hi yeah uh andrew camping uh

2194
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,440
looking at the uh slides uh and the uh

2195
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,480
report

2196
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,280
uh

2197
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,920
it's in quite heavy on the admin uh sort

2198
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,280
of content

2199
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,040
and there wasn't so much content in the

2200
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,320
report on

2201
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,120
the

2202
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,280
future of the internet

2203
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
is that just a sort of timing issue with

2204
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,760
this particular report or is that a fair

2205
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,600
reflection of the balance of work of the

2206
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,679
ib at the moment but it's more

2207
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,280
admin and less

2208
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,600
on the forward looking stuff

2209
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,120
so i think that's a format of this

2210
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,080
report this report is supposed to

2211
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,840
report on what we have done

2212
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
between the last meeting and now that's

2213
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,600
what we're doing

2214
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,760
we use a little bit the ib open meeting

2215
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,600
to also give you an idea about what

2216
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,520
we're thinking about in the future

2217
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,600
and we have only been using one hour for

2218
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,880
that meeting because we didn't want to

2219
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,480
take it away from

2220
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,000
the rest of the session time so we

2221
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,159
always are very squeezed on time and and

2222
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,199
very selective on topics

2223
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,080
um

2224
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,280
just one other comment there um

2225
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,679
i think that report does include what

2226
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,520
have we done is what have we officially

2227
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,840
produced so once we have published

2228
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,159
an iab technical rfc then that will show

2229
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,040
up

2230
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,440
in this case we are working on things

2231
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,360
but they were not published yet but for

2232
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,520
example we will have an edm technical

2233
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,239
program meeting tomorrow morning here um

2234
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,320
and there are other

2235
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,920
documents and discussions going on

2236
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,199
there's discussion going on on the

2237
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,480
architecture discuss list so

2238
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,000
yeah there's other stuff you can

2239
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,320
certainly engage with and i think we'd

2240
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,840
love to have all thoughts on the

2241
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,360
architecture discuss list or in the

2242
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,400
technical programs

2243
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,400
i do think that you know the the ieb has

2244
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,320
a lot of administrative tasks as we make

2245
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,520
those appointments we actually go

2246
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,040
through lots of interviews and lots of

2247
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,199
discussions and they're important um but

2248
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,400
but there are a few things that we have

2249
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,679
accomplished that we have you know that

2250
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,280
weren't on the slides really we're

2251
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,600
forming two new workshops coming up and

2252
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,280
those will be highly architectural and

2253
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,960
highly technical and

2254
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,560
there's a couple of reports coming out

2255
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,159
from past workshops and stuff so we have

2256
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,920
gotten some technical stuff done too and

2257
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,280
we're currently

2258
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,040
reviewing a number of drafts that have

2259
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,600
come in you know for iab

2260
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,520
potential publication on the iep stream

2261
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,280
and things like that but you're right

2262
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,239
probably the slides were a little

2263
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,799
administrative

2264
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,440
yeah so um in the same vein i i think

2265
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,920
it's quite easy to report on that admin

2266
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,159
things even though we do quite many of

2267
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,320
those tasks and they are important but

2268
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,239
but it's easy to list the last number of

2269
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,360
them but

2270
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,960
some of the uh

2271
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,639
architectural technical stuff actually

2272
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,080
takes a while so

2273
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,920
as mentioned there's uh

2274
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,760
one a workshop that we now announced

2275
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,840
there's another one on environmental

2276
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,920
impacts of the internet and internet

2277
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,159
applications that's coming up soon

2278
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,800
and uh it takes a while to to prepare

2279
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,719
this so so that that's that's what's

2280
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,400
happening in the background and might be

2281
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,880
just one one slide or one item on a

2282
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,199
report but it does take a while

2283
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,520
i'm just looking for the remote people

2284
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,639
for a second

2285
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,440
so give them also a chance but

2286
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,719
okay

2287
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,840
any other questions

2288
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,719
no

2289
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,080
yay you're done

2290
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,710
well

2291
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:26,000
[Applause]

2292

um

2294
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,280
i think we're just three of us here in

2295
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,759
the room

2296
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,800
um and i see that

2297
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,440
we might have some more people online

2298
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,440
hey

2299
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,080

so far apart

2309
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,840

2313
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,560
late in europe so

2314
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,040
probably couldn't make it

2315
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,960
right that brings us to the open mic for

2316
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,600
the llc do we have

2317
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,920
any questions

2318
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,880
hello i'm stuart chescher from apple

2319
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,920
uh

2320
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,920
we heard tonight about the ietf

2321
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,480
endowment and and i've seen the signage

2322
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,920
outside

2323
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,920
which i think is great

2324
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,800
um

2325
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,400
i just have one

2326
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,840
little suggestion for something to

2327
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,719
consider because i see on the website

2328
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,520
that

2329
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,679
um there's levels like flagship and

2330
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:23,360
benefactor and leadership and champion

2331
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,440
and all these things and this is very

2332
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,840
common a lot of museums and non-profit

2333
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,280
organizations

2334
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,760
and to be very blunt it's appealing to

2335
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,520
people's vanity it's it's a way of

2336
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,960
encouraging people to give a bit more

2337
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,639
money

2338
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,159
but the amounts of money are not listed

2339
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,440
on the web page

2340
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,400
so

2341
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,639
i don't think it serves the purpose if

2342
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,400
we actually keep the amount secret now i

2343
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,960
know it's crass to talk about money but

2344
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,639
if we're going to do the fundraising

2345
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,520
let's either do it or not do it

2346
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,120
yeah i see lee berkeley nodding so i

2347
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,960
guess your input will be taken into

2348
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,719
account berkeley right

2349
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,960
great thank you stewart so stuart um i

2350
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,159
never think it's crass to talk about

2351
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,239
money because it's kind of a job right

2352
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,760
to make sure we got enough to have these

2353
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,000
meetings so um thanks for your

2354
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,480
