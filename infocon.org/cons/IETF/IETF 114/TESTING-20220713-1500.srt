6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,880

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039

just test video and audio setup so we'd

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720
be happy to

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
do

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,040
those kinds of tests as well so

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
uh yeah so with that i'll get started um

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,759
the slides that i'm showing here are

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,600
generated off of the template that is

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
provided in

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
the working group

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
chairs uh sorry the session chairs

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,799
checklist

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,840
uh which you can find from the

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,919
preparing

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,160
web page on the itf website

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,200
so i encourage you for sure to

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
take a look at those pages and

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
and just review them that they're pretty

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
short and they have some nuggets that

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
can be useful for

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
just getting ready for

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
uh sessions at the upcoming meeting

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
or even for interim meetings between

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,959
them

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280

this is the note well again this session

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
is being recorded and as all its uh

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
meaning sessions are this session is

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
recovered by the itf note well i suspect

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
everybody here has is pretty familiar

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,319
with it

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,120
but it's always fun to read

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
a couple times a year which which of

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,040
course i do

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
again

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
this session is being recorded these are

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
some tips you'll see that i'm using

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
earbuds i'm actually using bluetooth

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
earbuds um which can work pretty well uh

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
but there are also sometimes uh

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
advantages to using wired your earplugs

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,879
and i understand um

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
earbuds sorry and i understand uh from

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,159
my younger daughters that those are

98
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,000
actually um

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
uh a la mode these days so uh don't

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,680
don't be ashamed to use wired

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
earphones and microphones

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
if you're on site this is the same as

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,400
was as was

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
true at 113

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,439
but if you're going to be on site it is

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
required to use medico to sign in for

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,799
sessions those

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
that sign in populates

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
the blue sheets

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,080
and um also provides uh qmat integrated

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
queue management for both in-person and

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
remote participants i think it worked

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,519
pretty well at 113 and that's the

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
feedback we got um so this

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
feature

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,759
is continued to 114

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
and if you're using you can use either

118
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
the light version or the uh full version

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,759
of the

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
medical client and if you're using the

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
light version you'll

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,160
notice

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
that it doesn't send audio or video by

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
default which is perfect for that

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
situation

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
you can use the full client

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
but you just have to make sure not to

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
send audio or video because

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
the in-room av

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
setup will take care of that for you if

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
you're actually in the room and of

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
course remote participants should just

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
whether you're a chair of a session or a

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
full

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
or or a participant you should use the

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
full version because um

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
that which is what what i'm using now

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
and what we all should be using now

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
since we're all remote uh and that

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
handles everything all in one place um

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
super handy

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
um

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
i'll just pause there

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,240
because this last slide is really just a

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
review of what i think everybody here

146
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
saw in the email which is we're having

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
these moderated test sessions which are

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
really just maybe more guided test

149
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,160
sessions because they're not really

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
moderated people can jump in whenever

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
they want uh there will be on-demand

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
testing beginning july 15th that is this

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
this friday um

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
and once

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
after friday the new version of um

156
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
medical be uh

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
deployed and you can set up um

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
test sessions and again instructions on

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
how to do that provided in the

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,080
chair guides uh on the web pages uh at

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
the url that you see here

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
um and you can you can set that up it

163
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
won't create a virtual interim meeting

164
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,759
or anything it's simply a test session

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
that you can use to test things out

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
amongst yourselves as chairs or you can

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,199
even invite your um presenters to join a

168
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
test session and you can test

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
everything their setups your setups

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,720
everything

171
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
if you if you set one of those up

172
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919

on site there will be a room set up

194
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
which is exactly like a session room and

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
again uh you can sign up via

196
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,120
a notepad again the link is is available

197

from the

198
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400
chair

199
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
chair resources page on the website and

200
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
if you just sign up for a session

201
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
that'll reserve that room for you

202
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
and you can walk into the room

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
you'll see the setup exactly as it is

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
for the meeting

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
and um

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
you can

207
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
connect to a test session including um

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
and test out the audio and video in in

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
the room

210
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,080
uh and as well with remote either

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
chairs or remote participants so

212
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
uh

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,960
yeah i think that takes me uh through

214
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
all the slides uh that i have uh the two

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
things that i think i know are different

216
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
and alessandra i'll

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
give you this warning that if i missed

218
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
something please please jump in and let

219
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,919
me know the two things that for sure are

220
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
different um

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,759
uh

222
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
the link said i see that

223
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,639
michael thinks go to on-site link okay

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
i'll check that out if there's

225
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,960
if you can tell me exactly which links

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
are

227
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,199
uh should be changed uh let me know

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,280
michael um

229
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
so so back to the updates uh the one is

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
that uh medico is now integrated with

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
zulip so this chat that we're using in

232
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,080
medico

233
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
actually um connects to the um

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
itf zoolip server in a in a stream

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,399
called testing and

236
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,120
just as with previously with xmpp

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
um

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,080
the the medico um

239
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
view you see is connected to the to the

240
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
more general group chat service

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
previously was xmpp jabber and now it's

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
zulip um so you can also use uh the

243
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
zulip web interface or a zoolop client

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,959
to connect to those same streams

245
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,720
um

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
and

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
the other change is that on the

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,839
uh

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
lite client

250
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
you can also find a link to the to the

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
chat stream so

252
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,399
uh previously there wasn't a link there

253
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,760
and now there is so uh that answer is a

254
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
a pretty common request we had to make

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
uh that link uh available for

256
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
on-site participants who are using the

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
lite client

258
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
and um so that you can have

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
you don't need to necessarily fire up a

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
separate um

261
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
client or use the full version of me to

262
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
go to get access to the to the chat

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
stream for any session that you wanted

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
to you were using the like client for

265
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
um

266
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
and alexander those i think those are

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,320
the two big changes uh am i missing did

268
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,959
i miss anything else

269
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,680
uh yeah i know as you said uh those are

270
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
the

271
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
the biggest changes uh uh let me check

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
my notes

273
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,720
and uh

274
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
yeah we made some changes about these

275
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,920
lights sharing uh feature because we

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,040
were asked

277
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
to give chairs the possibility to take

278
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
the control of the slides back once they

279
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,160
handed it over to somebody else and this

280
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
is now available in each earth interface

281
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,279
and

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,560
also there is now a button to do a sort

283
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,959
of a bulk update of all slide decks that

284
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
are available on the data tracker even

285
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,279
though this should not be needed because

286
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
now we have fixed the wrong behavior

287
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
that we had at last meeting where slides

288
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
were not automatically being pulled from

289
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
the data tracker at the room's opening

290
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,839
and uploaded into miteko how this has

291
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,920
been fixed so

292
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,000
there should be no need to to do any

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,240
update any upload manually by the chairs

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
and uh

295
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,320
yeah yeah another minor thing is that

296
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,279
now

297
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
pronouns that you set in the data

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
tracker

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
should be displayed if you over hover

300
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
any

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
any participant in the participant list

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
if of course if any pronouns has been

303
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
set in the data tracker profile

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,920
so i don't see

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,800
any actually for the current online

306
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
participants

307
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
so i cannot double check that but i can

308
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
try to join with another user

309
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
so when i tried to join this session

310
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
just now and uh and i got the as others

311
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
got that we got the light uh connection

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,839
i actually was told that i needed to

313
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
rotate my browser

314
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,240
on my desktop before i could use it and

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,079
i couldn't do anything with it

316
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
um

317
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,399
so

318
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,000
that was really difficult and i had no

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
way of getting to the full no no no way

320
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
of finding or discovering the full name

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
except that i know the urls well enough

322
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
that i just guessed

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
um

324
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,160
so yeah i i i and of course of course as

325
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,680
soon as i did the other thing then i got

326
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
kicked out of the other tab when i went

327
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
back to try to to tell you what it was

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
again it logged me into the other thing

329
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
that was rotated it kicked me out of

330
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,920
this one

331
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,880
so

332
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
i think it would be good to have uh um

333
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
i mean i think i guess you want to

334
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
encourage people to use the light

335
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,600
version who are on site

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
but i think it would be very good to

337
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
have to be able to switch back and forth

338
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
much more clearly

339
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,839
um

340
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
if that's a possibility if you can just

341
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
throw a link or something or i don't

342
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,160
know what

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
um

344
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
otherwise i think that most people are

345
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
going to on site are going to learn very

346
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,959
quickly to just use the full version and

347
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,399
hope they remember to turn off their

348
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,959
microphone

349
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
yeah i have to apologize again michael

350
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
thanks for pointing that out i

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,160
uh it was my mistake to send the in

352
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
sending the wrong version it's a wrong

353
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,839
link the light link

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
um so sorry for the trouble there

355
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
um but it's an interesting point about

356
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
if people

357
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
unintentionally click on

358
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,279
the uh the icon for example

359
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,680
in um

360
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
in data tracker

361
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,519
from their desktop on and to reach the

362
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,800
lite version

363
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
uh since they're next to each other

364
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
uh handling that case

365
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
might be worth looking into for sure

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
um

367
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
andy thanks for raising your hand please

368
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
go ahead

369
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,320
a couple quick questions first of all

370
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
can you hear and see me okay

371
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
yeah you look great

372
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,680
perfect and the second question is um if

373
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
i am the person who has the slides

374
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,000
loaded and i'm projecting the slides

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,399
and there's someone who's speaking who's

376
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
in the room who has the

377
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
the like client on their phone how do i

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
hand over control of the

379
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
of the of

380
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
putting the slides to the person

381
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,399
to the speaker or is that not possible

382
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,040
yeah surely it's possible uh you said if

383
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
the the people that should present uh

384
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
has the delight client right

385
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,240
yes on your phone

386
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
yeah as a chair you can just go to on

387
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,000
the participants list and you'll see a

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
a control that allows you to pass the

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
slides control to somebody else and this

390
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,920
is only available to chat so when the

391
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
system recognizes you as chair so now

392
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,639
this is available to greg for instance

393
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,279
and

394
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
just like you have to be sharing slides

395
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
not sharing screen

396
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,279
exactly yeah

397
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,240
right

398
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
right yeah and i think that there's some

399
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
chairs that may still be confused about

400
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
that

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
yeah yeah what i've done in the past is

402
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
i pre-loaded all the slides

403
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
and then i

404
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
shared the slides directly from mute

405
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
echo

406
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
yeah and that's correct and this way is

407
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
lights will also be displayed in the

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
room and everything should work if you

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
want to just pass the control to

410
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,560
somebody else just go just find him

411
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,279
in the participants list and hand handy

412
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,040
control over screen

413
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
perfect that's all i need to know thank

414
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
you exactly and you can also take the

415
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
control back when it's done if it

416
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
doesn't stop manually the

417
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
controlling of the slides

418
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
excellent cool

419
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
uh the one tip i'll say is that it's

420
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,000
only possible to have one um because i i

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
run into this personally so you have to

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,600
um

423
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
be sure that you're just sharing one um

424
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
set of slides at a time

425
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
so uh

426
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,120
yeah okay

427
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199

i'm gonna try

443
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
the

444
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,920
pool

445
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
feature just to

446
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
oh that's uh

447
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,120
that's wrong um

448
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,959
i didn't for my home okay uh so i've

449
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,559
started a poll

450
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,439
uh

451
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,799
just to see

452
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,599
who would be attending

453
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,679
uh 114 or participating in 114 in person

454
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
um

455
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,559
so uh that should be going on right now

456
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,480
uh and you should have been notified

457
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
um

458
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
we'll give it a few minutes

459
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
so you can hop in

460
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,918
um

461
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
uh just testing out

462
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
we'll give a five we'll use the counter

463
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
countdown counter we'll give it five

464
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
minutes uh

465
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
so there should be a countdown counter

466
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
now in the bottom of the screen so you

467
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,799
can see that feature in running

468
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,240
just trying to push all the buttons here

469
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
still don't see anybody in the queue

470
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
uh

471
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,399
don't see any questions

472
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,280
so uh

473
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
alessandra is there anything else you

474
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
think we ought to cover while we're

475
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,639
here

476
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
nope don't think so

477
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
okay

478
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
yeah hi shipping please go ahead

479
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
uh can you hear me

480
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
yeah very well

481
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,520
i'm a new chair so i know nothing let me

482
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
ask some silly question first uh

483
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,799
how do i

484
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,919
uh

485
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
start the mi echo

486
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
in

487
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,480
as a chair rather than a

488
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
you know a common participant

489
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
ah that's a great question uh so there

490
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
is magic

491
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
what happens is that when you uh click

492
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
on the url either through the data

493
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
tracker agenda or somewhere else for a

494
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
session

495
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,840
you log in using your data tracker

496
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
credentials

497
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
and medico

498
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
can tell from your roles in data tracker

499
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,120
if you should be chair for a particular

500
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
session

501
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
or should have that

502
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
those capabilities so when i clicked on

503
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,799
or i loaded the url for this session

504
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,559
i've been identified as a chair for this

505
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,039
session and so i automatically have the

506
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,840
chair rules and abilities

507
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
and this is um

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,400
this is a great uh this would be a great

509
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
example of where setting up a test

510
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
session in medico might be super helpful

511
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,840
because

512
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
you can set up a test session as a chair

513
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
and then you can see what medical look

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
like looks like as a chair

515
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
thank you very much the second question

516
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
is i saw you just now you start a timer

517
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,400
so how can i start this timer because we

518
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
may need to you know control people's

519
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
time

520
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
yeah that's a great question you should

521
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
see

522
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
as a chair uh and what i'll do is i'll

523
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,760
stop sharing this screen and i will

524
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
share my full screen so

525
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,520
you will see

526
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,610
everything

527
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,600
[Music]

you should see my pointer you can see

529
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
that the controls i have up here there's

530
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
this countdown clock uh control and you

531
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,039
can

532
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,720
start the timer

533
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
uh through the controls uh available in

534
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
this in this model so you'll it'll pop

535
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,520
up and uh it'll appear for everybody

536
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,679
once you start and you can set it to be

537
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,240
any time

538
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
where do you click to start the the

539
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,760
timer

540
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
didn't see

541
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,039

okay yeah this these are the general uh

544
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
controls that you'll see so you'll see

545
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
it'll be slightly different if you join

546
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
the session as chair

547
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
uh but

548
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
it'll be

549
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
uh this kind of

550
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
where where most of the controls are for

551
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
the session

552
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
okay thank you

uh

557
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
were able to use the

558
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,760
the hand raising tool and also the audio

559
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
stream tool so that's great uh i'll

560
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
leave this view

561
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,400
open sorry another question how do i

562
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
share the slides

563
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
oh fantastic um

564
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,039
so there are there are

565
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,240
uh two ways to do that uh and i confess

566
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
i'm not as adept as as possible the

567
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
preferred way to do that

568
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,360
is to open the meeting materials

569
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
uh

570
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,320
and i'm not i'm not doing this correct

571
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
correctly

572
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,280
so

573
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
alessandro i will ask you to help me out

576
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,000
to be honest

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520

actually how that works but there

598
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
right there is the icon and this is the

599
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
this is the point i made earlier is that

600
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
this

601
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
stream for sharing the desktop is now

602
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
occupied by me showing my screen so i

603
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
have to stop that and then

604
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,520
uh if i do stop that then i can share

605
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
a preloaded slide but i can't show you

606
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
what that looks like

607
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
but here

608
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
i will just share the slides and you can

609
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
see what it looks like and then

610
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,360
for me as chair i can or s because i

611
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,679
have slide control i can control which

612
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,720
slide is being shown

613
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
yeah actually uh shipping if rex stops

614
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
sharing his slides if you hit the same

615
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
button that's the the shares like ask to

616
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
share slides i think it's named in your

617
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
ui you just have to be moderated so you

618
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,919
you need somebody to accept your

619
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
requests and then you'll see the very

620
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
same interface that you'll see

621
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
automatically as chair without any need

622
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
to for approval in that case

623
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,159
yeah so if you want to try that

624
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,039
i can also trigger it

625
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,000
to you if you want so

626
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,880
yep and i see that we are looking at

627
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,279
your slides

628
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
so now you should you should as

629
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,039
alessandra mentioned you should have

630
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,640
control over

631
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
the slides through a bar at the bottom

632
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,039
of the window

633
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,039
yeah and you can also use arrows on the

634
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,080
keyboard if you want

635
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
um

636
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,760
i am a little bit confused so am i

637
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
selling the slides now yeah

638
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
you you are controlling the slides that

639
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,240
have been loaded into medico so

640
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
this is this is the

641
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
yeah

642
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
so just now because i selected this

643
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,279
ietf114

644
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
test session so i think that it's now

645
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
shown on the slide but i think that

646
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
at the beginning uh which button do you

647
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,960
click to exit all the buttons at the top

648
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
like the yeah it's one of the buttons at

649
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
the top now i triggered the button for

650
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,960
you

651
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,600
just to to show this other possibility

652
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
but if i now

653
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
stop this light sharing if you hit the

654
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
it should be the second button from the

655
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,480
from the left just next to the hand icon

656
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,880
yeah it looks like a little document

657
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,159
with a line through it if you're not

658
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,240
sharing

659
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,039
okay thank you

660
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
and and

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,919
one of the important points that you've

662
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,440
brought up is that

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
pre-loading slides

664
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,720
is really

665
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,559
a much better way to share slides during

666
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,320
the session so if you are sharing a

667
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
session and you have presenters that

668
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,799
will be using slides

669
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
obviously it's

670
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
nice to have them loaded into data

671
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
tracker because

672
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,559
then everybody can see them even if

673
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
they're not using

674
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,679
the full

675
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,840
go interface for example they're in the

676
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
room using the light interface and want

677
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
to see the slides separately

678
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,120
but also it just makes

679
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,840
it much smoother uh so you don't rely on

680
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
your network connection to

681
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,919
to share the slides

682
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,080
right understood

683

okay fantastic thanks for asking that

684
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
question that's a great question and um

685
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
definitely an important point

686
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,240
and i see marco in the chat has provided

687
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,360
a link to the uh

688
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
guide for chairs of medical sessions so

689
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,000
that's that's also useful and might

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,520
provide some info

691
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
about topics you hadn't thought about or

692
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
didn't encounter but um would be good to

693
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
know

694
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,159
uh our our session let me go back to the

695
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,600
show of hands tool

696
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,279

uh

698
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,000
it looks like um

699
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
eight of the folks here will be on

700
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,919
site and then are in person so should

701
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,440
say and

702
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,399
uh

703
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
three didn't raise their hand so um

704
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
uh they will be i suppose remote at this

705
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
point so

706
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,480
that's actually um

707
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,640

to catch up with people in person and

710
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,080
and of course if you're

711
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
remote you can um

712
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,720

713
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
space will still be available

714
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,399
um and

715
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,679

alessandro again you'll correct me if

734
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520

830
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,040

00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
that there's the share preloaded slides

839
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,720
that are available to share and i can't

846
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,160
show you because i can only show you

847
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
either my desktop or the slides so it

848
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,640
won't allow me

849
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
it won't allow me to do both but if they

850
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
preload the slides into data tracker

851
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,119

852
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
deck will be available to share

853
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,200
and what you can do

854
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
is um

855
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,880
you can start sharing those slides and

856
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,480
i'll show you how it looks from the user

857
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,079
perspective

858
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,520
you can start sharing the slides and

859
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,880
then pass control to the presenter

860
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,520
so that they can control the slides

861
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,319
uh

862
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,599
and here's what else

863
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,640
so

864
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,960
for example uh

865
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,079
yep

866
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,240
so i'm gonna share the slides that i've

867
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,839
made for this session

868
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,880
and i'm going to pass control to you uh

869
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
oh i should have showed you that too

870
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,640
um

871
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,480
yeah actually let me let me stop and

872
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,680
show you that

873
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,680
um

874
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,119
it's it's very awkward because um

875
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,760
uh i can't show you everything but uh

876
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
there is a guy there's a chairs guy that

877
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,119
that lays this out um

878
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,040
yes i want to do that and i want to do

879
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,640
the whole deal

880
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
but not that one

881
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,680
so okay so now i'm gonna if i once i

882
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,839
start sharing slides uh from the share

883
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
slides icon up here

884
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,359
uh what i do is then go here and you can

885
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,119
for a particular user say oh pass

886
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,480
control slides

887
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,760
so i'll do that now and you'll see what

888
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
it looks like it is a user um

889
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
so

890
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,839
okay so i'm sharing the slides now i've

891
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,599
rolled over your name i see this past

892
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,079
slides control so now you

893
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,760
will have slides

894
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
uh controls at the bottom of the slide

895
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,720
and you can advance the slides um

896
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,000
yeah so it's pretty handy and then as a

897
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
chair you can you can revoke the

898
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
permission to share slides so you i will

899
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,319
take slide control back and you'll see

900
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,599
this so now i have slides control again

901
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,319
so

902
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,119
um

903
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,440
it's pretty handy the key is to upload

904
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,079
the slides before and then once that's

905
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,599
done it's all really really nice

906
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,240
the other thing to say is if

907
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,319
you are expecting

908
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,119
video because i know the nrw folks are

909
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,920
um

910
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,160
crazy and use things like video during

911
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,720
presentations uh you should just make

912
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,640
sure to let um

913
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,040
meet echo know about that ahead of time

914
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,280
because midiko as a as a

915
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
webrtc client uh

916
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
doesn't doesn't really handle video very

917
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,599
well and and medico can

918
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,960
if you can get them the video ahead of

919
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,480
time they can do some things so that it

920
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,839
works great for everybody

921
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,800
i have two more follow-up questions so

922
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,760
one is

923
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,160
so um what if um the authors would like

924
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,359
to present

925
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,079
all offline then how can you broadcast

926
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,359
this you know

927
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,520
broadcast this thing's presentation

928
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,119
through this

929
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
platform

930
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,520
yeah so if they want to use slides that

931
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
are not uploaded to data tracker um

932
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
that's possible it's definitely not

933
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,960
recommended because it ends up

934
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
meaning that if

935
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,720
it puts higher demand on their network

936
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,240
connection

937
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,920
and it's just not as it's not as

938
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,359
seamless like if someone has to take

939
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,200
over for them you can't pass control but

940
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
it's definitely possible and the way to

941
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,359
do that is you'll see

942
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,319
there's a share screen icon

943
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,319
just below your name it looks like a

944
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,040
monitor of computer monitor

945
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,359
and if you click on that

946
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,440
you can request and you can try it out

947
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,359
and see what it looks like right now

948
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,280
if you click on that

949
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
i us chair will get a request to allow

950
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,880
you to share your screen i see

951
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,560
and the other trick about that is that

952
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,839
you need to

953
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,960
you can only share us pre-loaded slides

954
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
or share a screen

955
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
uh you can't do both at the same time so

956
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,359
i would have to stop the slideshare

957
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,079
so the officer shouldn't use the keynote

958
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,800
or powerpoint for their presentation

959
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,599
they have to connect this platform

960
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,000
and uh

961
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,920
share their screen

962
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,680
even if they would like to present on

963
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,319
site right so

964
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,400
yeah if they're presenting on-site it's

965
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,280
actually

966
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,640
uh even

967
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,240
um more recommended so that for them to

968
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,000
use um

969
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,960
the medico's slide sharing the other

970
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,000
thing i'll say is that um

971
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,040
in the itf anyway i think it's also true

972
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
in the irtf

973
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,760
um the general idea is that slides are

974
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,280
available

975
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,359
as part of the meeting agenda

976
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,599
in advance so that

977
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,440
that's just sort of the norm

978
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
um so if they're

979
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,079
if they're presenting

980
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,359
like powerpoint or a

981
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,720
keynote format that they have to convert

982
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,880
to pdf i think to upload to data tracker

983
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
anyway

984
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,319
and once they do that it automatically

985
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,880
shows up in midico so everything

986
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,720
that's available in data tracker is is

987
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,160
available via midiko automatically

988
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,280
um

989
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
the last one is what if so um so what if

990
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
the presenter is you know would like to

991
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200
present remotely but let's say his

992
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,520
network connection is not that good so

993
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,400
our plan is to request and recruit the

994
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,520
video

995
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,880
and posted youtube just in case

996
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,000
is it possible to use this platform and

997
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,200
play the video here or yeah

998
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,359
yeah for sure and that's ideal if you

999
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,960
upload the video

1000
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,359
to youtube and then you have a url you

1001
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,079
can share with the medical folks they

1002
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,760
are happy to

1003
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,680
there's a medical person that's in every

1004
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,319
session so people who actually run the

1005
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,839
platform monitor the session so if you

1006
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,839
just tell them hey we have these uh

1007
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,280
three or four videos that we want to

1008
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
play during our session

1009
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,640
uh and i think they've done this in the

1010
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,680
past so it's it's not new uh they'll

1011
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,440
just uh

1012
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,800
be monitoring the session and when you

1013
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,319
say hey play this video they'll play

1014
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,920
that video and it'll show up through the

1015
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
platform

1016
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,440
which includes in the room in

1017
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,079
philadelphia um

1018
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,760
so that's that's definitely not a

1019
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,640
problem uh and is a great way to handle

1020
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,079
that stuff

1021
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
so if something doesn't go well i don't

1022
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,599
need to be panicked so

1023
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
no if you if you preload the slides and

1024
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,520
you have the video shared with midiko in

1025
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,079
advance um everything should go super

1026
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,960
smoothly um the other thing to say is

1027
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,119
that like i said someone is in medico

1028
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,720
and usually they're monitoring pretty

1029
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,280
closely especially anrw

1030
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,440
sessions because they're um

1031
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,200
like i said

1032
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,440
it's a little different but if if you

1033
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,760
are in the session and in the chat for

1034
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,440
the session if you type mideco

1035
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,240
uh

1036
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,480
that they have a they have a

1037
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,319
bot that alerts them so as soon as that

1038
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,079
string medico shows up in a chat uh

1039
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,319
like sirens and red lights go off in the

1040
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,400
control room that they have and they

1041
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
will come and take a look um

1042
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,640
so that's always that's always a

1043
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,160
possibility

1044
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,480
got it so should i type a chat

1045
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,440
here

1046
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,240

yeah if you type medico into the chat i

1051
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,079
believe alessandra will pop back in

1052
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,880
he's he's monitoring as a zulu abuser

1053
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,400
