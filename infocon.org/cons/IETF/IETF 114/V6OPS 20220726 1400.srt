1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,440
thread and run are

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,639
remote

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,280
so i will manage the meeting today

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
we publish the agenda sometimes ago and

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
we have a tight schedule today

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
so unless somebody has a problem with

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
the agenda we are going to just start

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,400
with uh warren's talk

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
talk might be overselling it

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
so hi all i'm warren i've been serving

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
as opseidi for

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
a long time now i think that the same

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
currently in my third

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
third term i think

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,320
and

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,800
while i am still enjoying it i think it

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,239
would be useful for there to be a bunch

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,640
of other candidates as well for the

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
upcoming upcoming cycle

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
so i will probably run again but i'd

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,199
also really really like some other

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
people to run

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
so if anybody is potentially interested

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
or just want to know more about the

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,479
position

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,080
or find out what it's actually like

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
please come and find me at some point

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
i'm happy to chat let you know sort of

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,759
the time investment what's actually

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,520
needed etc

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
so you know look for me i'll probably be

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
wearing a hat come chat happy to talk

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
thank you warren so we will start our

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,880
first presentation

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,799
make

36
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
so before next star i would like to

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,280
remind every speaker today that again we

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
have a tight schedule

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,000
we are going to control the time

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
strictly

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
we hope you can finish your presentation

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
in 10 minutes and save the other 10

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
minutes for

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,959
discussion thank you

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
get that

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,238
off the screen

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
i already dismissed it

48
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,280
over there

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
it's not all nice green but it's over

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
there

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
well let's wing it we'll do it live

52
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,840
all right so

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,599
um long time listener first time caller

54
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
for anyone that doesn't know who i am

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
i'm nick braglio i work for the energy

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
sciences network and i'm also the if i

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
could interrupt you for a second

58
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
the volume is very low could you come

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
closer to the mic

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
all right then

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
um okay so

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
basically uh i'm nick roglio the energy

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
sciences network i'm also the department

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,680
of energy's ipv6 only implementation

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
lead

66
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
i'm here to talk about some

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,560
unintentional

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
behaviors with ula that we found

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,080
so we go to the next slide if you can

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,959
no that's not my side deck

71
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,320
[Laughter]

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
so while we work that out uh basically

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,159
this this talk isn't really and this

74
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,478
draft isn't really intended to be

75
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
a we're not trying to solve any problems

76
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
with it essentially what we're trying to

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,360
do is identify problem codify it

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
um

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
and the uh

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
the basics of that are that uh the

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
behavior of ula addressing as defined by

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
rfc 6724

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
is preferred below ipv4 addressing now

84
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,240
whether that was intentional or not

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,759
sort of

86
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
not really relevant to what i'm talking

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
about because that is not the way that

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
it is perceived

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
um ula deployments using de facto best

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,759
practices for dns uh the way that

91
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,040
everyone that i know has been taught

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
with i've been taught has you know used

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
the same a record quad a record for each

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
resource and let the protocol stack

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,240
decide now when we say let protocol

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
stack decide most operational engineers

97
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
have been taught that ipv6 is the

98
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
default if it exists so

99
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
you deploy a dual stack network which is

100
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
by and large what we see the most of in

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
in operations and if you use ula

102
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,039
and you're using proper dns uh or what i

103
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,199
have deemed to be proper dns

104
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,479
hygiene

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,600
you will never use ula addressing which

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
makes it functionally useless for anyone

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
that's using

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,639
a dual stack network

109
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,120
next slide please

110
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,919
so

111
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
there are obviously some ways to adjust

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
this um although i will assert that

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
operationally they are all very very

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
heavyweight and

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
not really

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
sustainable

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
they're problematic to scale across

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
diverse multifunctional organizations

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
they impose very significant impediments

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
to operations where ipv6 is already

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,840
really hard to get in the door

122
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,520
um in a lot of enterprises they would

123
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
require automation platforms that are

124
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
also you know sort of in their fledgling

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
state and that's not to even mention all

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
of the embedded devices operational

127
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,319
technology

128
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
car partner guest equipment and other

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,479
legacy stuff

130
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
that you know you may or may not see but

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
everybody probably has some of that you

132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,880
just have no mechanism for changing

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,919
what the address table um preferences

134
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
are so you can do this in linux there's

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
been a lot of discussion about this on

136
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,479
the list

137
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
um and i believe uh brian carpenter

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
wrote a

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
python script that will sort of make

140
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
some of these adjustments but

141
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,960
scaling that across thousands hundreds

142
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,599
tens of thousands whatever devices even

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,160
at you know even using open source

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
platforms is very difficult to do so

145
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
um

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
that sort of makes this a little bit

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
more important to for ipv6 deployments

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
where it's already difficult to get

149
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
movement within a lot of enterprise

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
space next slide please

151
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
so in addition to that

152
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
if you go and look at some of the files

153
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
in the code you'll still see remnants of

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
rfc 3484 in actively deployed and

155
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
up-to-date systems now that was

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
written

157
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
6724 which replaced 3484 was written in

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,639
2012 that's 10 years ago so even after

159
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,400
10 years we still don't have a full

160
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,479
migration over to whatever the current

161
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
rfc standard is for this uh

162
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,639
addressing

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,440
that tells me mean time to replacement

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
implementation replacement is

165
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,560
over 10 years

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
so that's one of the reasons that we

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
haven't actually proposed a solution to

168
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
this because it's going to take a very

169
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
very long time to even get it in place

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,199
so what we want to do is just codify the

171
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,039
problem so that anyone that's looking

172
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,440
for it can go find it very easily

173
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,160
because

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
i'll be fully uh honest it was very

175
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
difficult for me to find information on

176
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
that i had to actually go digging around

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
in the code and then i realized that it

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,840
was kind of there but not not really

179
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,680
um and you know because of that timeline

180
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
just doesn't really align with current

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
enterprise deployment needs again where

182
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
it's very difficult to get things put in

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
place that uh you know changes as major

184
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
as ipv6 deployment

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
next slide

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
so here's a quick example

187
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
very very simple uh this is just

188
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,640
something that i threw together in my

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
little lab that i've got it's just a

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
simple ping that shows you if i've got

191
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
you know the dns records matching a

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
record quad a record both pointing to

193
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,839
the same

194
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,440
um

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
uh dns name you know obviously v4 and v6

196
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
address families if i just do a simple

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
ping uh which will use the dns

198
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
resolution it will always use the ipv4

199
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
address there are lots and lots and lots

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,120
of other examples of this

201
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
um and you know all of the caveats of

202
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
you know applications can decide blah

203
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
blah blah

204
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
yeah that's also relevant however this

205
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
is a pretty good example and probably

206
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
sort of the first order testing that any

207
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
operational engineer is going to do and

208
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
they're going to right away say well

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
this doesn't look right

210
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
next slide

211
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
all right so

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
is there any reason not to adopt this

213
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,760
draft that's my question to you uh if

214
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
you haven't read it it's pretty easy

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
read it's not very long it's really

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,959
straight to the point it's got a couple

217
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
of examples in there

218
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
uh and

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
yeah if there's any reason not to adopt

220
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
it then you know let's uh let's hash

221
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
them out

222
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
with any questions

223
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,640
okay ted ted lemon um so uh the first

224
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
question i have is why is it a problem

225
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
that when you have a dual stack network

226
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,680
um that it doesn't pick ipv6

227
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
well so

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,959
the way that we've been taught or the

229
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,240
least at least the way i've been taught

230
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
for the last 20 years uh is that it

231
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
you prefer ipv6 if it exists so

232
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,120
if you don't have that maybe it hasn't

233
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
been quite that long but

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
uh what i'm asking

235
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,279
is what operational problem does this

236
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
represent not is it correct

237
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,839
what operational problem is incorrect

238
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
i'm not asking whether whether the

239
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
behavior that you just displayed in the

240
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
last slide is correct or not

241
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
i'm asking what operational problem it

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
represents

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
why is this bad

244
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
because in an operational network

245
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
when you have an expectation of one

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,519
thing and you see a different one it

247
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
causes okay it's unnecessary resource

248
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
expense experience so the problem is

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
that you have an expectation that when

250
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,519
you have a dual stack network that

251
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
you're always going to use ipv6 and

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,519
therefore when you find yourself not

253
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
using ipv6 you have that's bad

254
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
i'm not saying it's bad well

255
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
i'm just saying that as someone who has

256
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
helped support engineers for a very long

257
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
time

258
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
that's not something it's something that

259
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,240
throws them off and it's something

260
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,959
that's relatively unexpected by people

261
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
that are just coming into ipg v6

262
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
and so therefore it typically is a bit

263
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
of an impediment because it's a one-off

264
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
right so i mean what i'm getting at is

265
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
that what you described doesn't surprise

266
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
me at all and doesn't seem like an

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,880
operational problem to me at all

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
um and so if a lot of people see if a

269
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
lot of people have the reaction that you

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
do then it's probably worth documenting

271
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,279
that

272
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
if you deploy a dual stack environment

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
you shouldn't expect that ipv6 will

274
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
always be chosen but aside from that i

275
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
don't see why there's a an issue well so

276
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
that's what this that's what this draft

277
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,760
does

278
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
i mean that's literally the purpose of

279
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
the draft

280
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
uh hi jen linkova first let me uh

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
answer to ted's comment actually this is

282
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
bad because

283
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
dual strike is supposed to be a path

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,079
to eventually get rid of before if

285
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
you're never using v6 you have no idea

286
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
if your v6 is working while you kind of

287
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
assume oh i've been running ipv6 for

288
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,399
years so this is actually not

289
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
not a good situation however my question

290
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
is

291
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,639
so i read the draft and i was kind of

292
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,600
confused about that purpose because the

293
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
behavior is actually documented in

294
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
default address selection rfcs right so

295
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
i'm just curious if the conclusion of

296
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
the document should be just don't use

297
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
ula use

298
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,279
uh

299
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
global address space and your problem

300
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,600
just go way the way automatically

301
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
i mean that's certainly one answer and i

302
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
won't say that it's wrong that would be

303
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,399
the answer that i would prefer um

304
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
although i did not think that i should

305
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
be you know those of us that wrote this

306
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
draft wasn't just me thought that we

307
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,240
shouldn't be that prescriptive with it

308
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
we really just wanted to identify the

309
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,959
behavior

310
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
um i would i would prefer

311
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
gua addresses everywhere however in the

312
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,519
enterprise space

313
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,800
there they

314
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
always go to ula first

315
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
not always but in a lot of cases they

316
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
will look at ula first for reasons that

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
i don't think we really need to

318
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
yes like i understand but then we

319
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
probably just say if you using ula be

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
ready for this it basically becomes

321
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
useless so there's no reason to have

322
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,839
ulas because they're not going to be

323
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,320
used uh but if you really want to get v6

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,279
experience use global addresses and my

325
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
my opinion it would be much more useful

326
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,519
the document will be much more useful

327
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
than because it will be actionable

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
people can read it and come to some

329
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
conclusions and we can give them some

330
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
operational guidance

331
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
instead of just telling them things

332
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
which they could probably find in

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
another document they just look hard

334
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
enough and actually i find your slide

335
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
very optimistic because you're saying

336
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,160
that in 10 years enterprises need ipv6

337
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,399
i'm really glad to see to hear that

338
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,880
because most enterprises do not agree i

339
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
mean i would say 10 years ago

340
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,680
enterprises needed ipv6 but now you know

341
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
i don't always get what i want

342
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,279
mark andrews um

343
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
we got here because

344
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
ula

345
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
having higher preference

346
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,839
actually got

347
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
caused operational problems

348
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
that's why this the current draft the

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
current rsc says

350
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
insert your local

351
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
prefix

352
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
that is an instruction to device

353
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,720
vendors right do the work

354
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,680
yeah they didn't do that yeah

355
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
we've got it we've got an rfc which says

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
do the right thing

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,480
if your vendor is not doing the right

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
thing

359
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
log a bug report with your vendor

360
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
that is the way to fix this yeah it

361
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,440
doesn't take much um i would i would beg

362
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
to differ with that because that's been

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
my life for the last three years it

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,399
still doesn't

365
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,440
if you

366
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
go and

367
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
say fix it

368
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
i'm not saying i'm not saying you're

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,519
wrong you're you're totally correct but

370
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,240
that isn't the reality of it in my

371
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
experience so i think that having a

372
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
multi-faceted approach is probably a

373
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
good idea i think we should file bug

374
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,560
reports for these things as well and i

375
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
do that very regularly but at the moment

376
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
ula is talking internally within the

377
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,279
network

378
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,560
it's an internal address

379
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
sure so

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,639
what does it really matter for an

381
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
internal address whether you're using v6

382
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,199
or v4 to talk to your internal machines

383
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
it's a repeatability thing if you don't

384
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
have

385
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
there is no repeatability when you got

386
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,959
to address families

387
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,160
well there should be at least the

388
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
expectation of it yeah there is an

389
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
expectation that if you're talking to a

390
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
global address

391
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
you'll do v6 first sure

392
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,600
and if you're talking

393
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,759
and if you're talking to a ula

394
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
you'll do ula first if your vendor has

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
done the right thing

396
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
if your vendor has stuffed it up

397
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,079
i'm not disagreeing with you i think

398
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
you're right but i've also not seen that

399
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
behavior

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
so i don't know that's what that's why i

401
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,759
got put in there so the vendors could do

402
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,279
the right thing

403
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,480
because

404
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
you need

405
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,560
a sink for ula in general

406
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,759
at the border you need to have

407
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
the icmp v6s come back to say that

408
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,240
say

409
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
your source address was bad

410
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
and

411
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
and

412
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
you have border rails which aren't doing

413
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,920
that which got us to where we are now

414
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,800
no i agree with you i mean the reason

415
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
this exists is because the behavior is

416
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
unexpected

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,880
it's not because of anything anyone did

418
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,959
other than the vendors not implementing

419
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
whatever was written it's not so much

420
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,839
unexpected

421
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
it's doing exactly what i was told to do

422
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,799
as far as event as far as

423
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,599
the device vendor has implemented

424
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,359
the optional parts on non-optional parts

425
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
there is no

426
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
expectation that

427
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,959
with this current rfc

428
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
that your lies will be used first

429
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,839
unless they're unless they're talking to

430
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
another local address in which case they

431
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,520
should be

432
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
no

433
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
because

434
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
i mean you

435
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
if the device vendor that you're

436
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
initiating the connection from

437
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,400
has done the right thing you'll use a

438
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
ula

439
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,160
but there's not nothing we can really do

440
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
to fix this

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
and again i'm not trying to propose that

442
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
we fix anything all i'm doing is writing

443
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,760
a draft that says this is unintended and

444
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,640
this is

445
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
this is unexpected

446
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
so

447
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
that when other enter when other

448
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,640
engineers go to do test these things

449
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
that they can go okay well now this is

450
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,000
written

451
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,799
and now i know what to expect

452
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,919
except

453
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
yeah

454
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
we want them to actually fix the devices

455
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,080
and experience i completely agree with

456
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
you on that

457
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
that was a bigger apple than i was

458
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,640
willing to take a bite of today yeah so

459
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
that's why juniper um

460
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,000
i agree that the vendors should fix this

461
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
but i don't know that they're going to

462
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
in any timely manner

463
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,840
and then going back to the

464
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,160
comment

465
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,720
just using gua would be great except

466
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
there's not a lot of address space that

467
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,840
you if you're not

468
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,400
actually grabbing a gui address space

469
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
for some purpose

470
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
to use in things like what you did kevin

471
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,600
with

472
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,679
building labs and documentation and

473
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
stuff so yep we're kind of falling in

474
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
between a little space here where

475
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
things can get complete yeah and you're

476
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
right so there are there are some other

477
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,679
things as well that are not just the um

478
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,520
you know the lab space and

479
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
other things which is how i ran into it

480
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
there are there are reasons that that

481
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,240
organizations don't go get gua space

482
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
that aren't just because they don't want

483
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
to pay for it there are also small

484
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,559
deployments that will enable ula by

485
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
default as their ipv6 stack

486
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,039
and

487
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,000
you know

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
those are mostly open source but they

489
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
exist out there and are on by default so

490
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,120
you know it's not just a case of

491
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,039
you should use gua space which in

492
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
general i i enjoy that that school of

493
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
thought

494
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,919
um but in reality

495
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
there's a contingency that is

496
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
you know measurable that just can't or

497
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
won't do that

498
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,799
okay everything uh cisco

499
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,200
i agree with you it's unexpected maybe

500
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
but it's fully intended behavior but my

501
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
main point when i'm coming to the mic is

502
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
to challenge your statement telling that

503
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
enterprise mainly use ula that's not

504
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,919
really what i'm seeing and i'm meeting

505
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
many enterprise customers right

506
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
simply no no i'm not saying many of them

507
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,880
are using it but almost universally i

508
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
get asked about it

509
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
one of the first five questions and you

510
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,520
sort of have to lead them the other

511
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,480
direction because that it isn't really a

512
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
supportable model in many cases which is

513
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,880
true when i talk to end user they say

514
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,919
ula oh like rsc 1918 then you took five

515
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,919
ten minutes and then you after that's

516
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,000
exactly the conversation that i hear

517
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
over and over again and that's really

518
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
what led to this because you know as

519
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,039
part of my job i've been asked a lot of

520
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
those questions

521
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
so i would encourage folks to go look at

522
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
the list

523
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
there's been a fair amount of chatter

524
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,360
about this draft

525
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
uh if we need to take the discussion

526
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,919
further there great

527
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,440
one last

528
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
comment along the queue

529
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,640
changly you can go ahead

530
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
so so basically what i want to say is

531
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,880
that i'm really happy to see the draft

532
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
because we had a lot of discussion on

533
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
the mailing list

534
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
and and we

535
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,600
i'm happy to see the draft but

536
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
we may need to have more discuss on the

537
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,918
mailing list thank you for the others

538
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,159
okay

539
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
i guess change that he wants to see more

540
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,919
discussion on the list

541
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,679
so

542
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,799
thank you

543
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,039
thank you

544
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,559
huh

545
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
something

546
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,840
something it's your turn

547
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,280
something are you on

548
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
maybe we go to the next presentation

549
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
there

550
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
interesting

551
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
hi morning

552
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
so this is just an update of the james

553
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,799
draft which is a work between the

554
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
university of liege and cisco

555
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,000
next slide please

556
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
it's

557
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
this

558
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
well

559
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,240
now i lose control over here

560
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,720
hi what's going on

561
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,918
well i have to open yourself

562
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
so

563
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
all right

564
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,480
um so quickly um

565
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
the updates from our previous version is

566
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,039
that we as expected we added some

567
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,760
vantage points to the cooperative

568
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,279
topology

569
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,919
and we say vantage points means new

570
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
results so we also include it and we

571
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,880
differentiated udp and tcp as layer 4

572
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
because we noticed some differences

573
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,200
between the two

574
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,679
and we also made some editorial changes

575
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
so this is the topology uh in the

576
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,000
cooperative mode we had 21 vms spread

577
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
across the world we rented them

578
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,960
with different

579
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,120
cloud providers to avoid the data center

580
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
to data center trap

581
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
and there is no valid network so they

582
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,640
are going over the public internet

583
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
about the methodology well no rocket

584
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
science here and just the

585
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
traceroute-like technique although this

586
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,279
is with our own library and what we do

587
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,080
is that we test each pair of vms in both

588
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,360
directions so

589
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
vma is the sender and vmb is the

590
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,080
receiver and we do the opposite for each

591
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,279
pair

592
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,520
for each experiment we have a test with

593
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,480
udps layer 4 and tcp as layer 4 because

594
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
as i mentioned initially we were

595
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,840
suspecting that we might have some

596
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
differences between the two

597
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,640
and spoiler this is the case

598
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
so but the experiments

599
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,039
we tested by open destination options

600
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,200
and we vary the size because again we

601
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,039
suspected that the size could matter

602
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,559
we also tested each routing type header

603
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
from 0 to 6 included

604
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,919
we tested fragment headers so atomic and

605
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,640
non-atomic and we also vary the size so

606
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,200
basically we just set the m flag to 1 or

607
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,720
0

608
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,120
but ipsec we tested authentication

609
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
header and esp

610
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,760
we also test it with no next header and

611
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
also with ethernet as the next header so

612
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,679
based on rfc 8986

613
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,559
and for each experiment we try without

614
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,559
extension editor as a comparison so

615
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,960
we'll see the result right after this

616
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
and what we do for the prop traffic is

617
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,880
that we marked it with

618
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,120
an email address

619
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,399
so that

620
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
entities could identify us and it is

621
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,080
based on the draft that you see on the

622
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,399
screen

623
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,960
so the two tricky parts here is that if

624
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,120
you want to be able to attribute the

625
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,279
drop to a specific autonomous system

626
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,480
well you will face a lot of routers that

627
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,039
do not respond and so for the first

628
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,399
figure on the top

629
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,919
you see that the first two rotors

630
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,279
responded

631
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,880
and then nothing

632
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,279
and actually this is what we saw very

633
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,799
often so

634
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,679
if

635
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,440
this is the truth without extension

636
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
header and then you made a test with an

637
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,960
extension letter

638
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,440
if there is a drop somewhere on the path

639
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,760
it becomes hard to guess which as is

640
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,360
responsible for the drop

641
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
so this is something that we have to

642
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,919
improve in the algorithm

643
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,520
and um next slide please

644
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,799
all right so the interesting part

645
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,520
um so for the hub by hub first

646
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600
this is in red obviously because this is

647
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
very bad

648
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
so if you take the first row

649
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,039
with the length of 8 bytes you see that

650
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,080
you have roughly 10 9 or 10 persons

651
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,840
going

652
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,039
through and obviously if you increase

653
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,200
the size so if you take 256

654
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,760
you roughly have three persons so this

655
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
is very bad and it goes worse if you

656
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,919
increase the size so

657
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,960
overall you cannot rely on buy hops if

658
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
you want to use them over the public

659
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,440
environment

660
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,440
about the destination header uh it's in

661
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
orange this time because you have some

662
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,159
good and some bad

663
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,880
so if you look at the udp column

664
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,919
from

665
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,559
size 8 bytes to

666
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,640
24 included

667
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
this is for yellable

668
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,799
and once you reach 32 you see a little

669
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,039
bit of drops so this is still good but

670
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,240
you cannot call it a reliable anymore

671
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,039
but the big drop that we noticed is once

672
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,200
you reach

673
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,640
64 bytes

674
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
and it goes worse and worse when you

675
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,799
increase it again

676
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
again here you see some differences

677
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,039
between udp and tcp

678
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,039
at that time we have no explanation but

679
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,240
we will investigate it for sure

680
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,919
i'm rooting headers in orange 2 because

681
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,799
some are good and some are bad

682
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,200
the one that are going through are types

683
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
2 3

684
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
and

685
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,200
5 and 6

686
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
and actually the ones that are not

687
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,200
reliable not that bad but still

688
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,360
unreliable are type zero one and four

689
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,519
and this is not really a big surprise

690
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,360
here because zero and one are supposed

691
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
to be duplicated

692
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,159
and type 4 is segment rotating so this

693
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,919
is actually quite a good news from a

694
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,880
security point of view

695
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,200
back to red so for the fragment

696
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
headers

697
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,559
well the non-atomic is not that bad but

698
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,679
again you cannot call it reliable and

699
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,840
obviously the atomic with the m flex set

700
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
to zero

701
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
you have one chance over two to go

702
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,039
through

703
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,159
and oh

704
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,120
green

705
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,159
good news

706
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,760
so

707
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,679
not to be so excited about the first one

708
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,159
because this is the no next header so

709
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
you obviously have no extension header

710
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,039
here

711
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,840
and no layer 4 either

712
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,000
you have ethernet as the next header

713
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
which is going through

714
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,360
and good news for ipsec ah and esp are

715
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,279
all going true

716
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,320
so

717
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,519
what we can

718
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,240
learn from this is that

719
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,039
by hub again you cannot use them

720
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,000
and

721
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,840
and think they are going through

722
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
destination options you have hope until

723
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,320
a specific sizes

724
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,200
and we have i think nalini is there um

725
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
she has a draft about a destination

726
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,880
option um

727
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
not only for limited domains but for the

728
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,080
public internet

729
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
so

730
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,919
uh if i'm not wrong i think uh her

731
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
option is maximum 40 bytes

732
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,399
long

733
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,919
so

734
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,679
i think there is hope for for this

735
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
option and this is actually a use case

736
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,000
for the public internet with hop by hub

737
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
or destination option which is a good

738
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,080
thing

739
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
so what we plan for this draft is to

740
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,919
continue measurements

741
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,399
with the wild version so up to now we

742
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,159
had a specific testbed with 21 vms now

743
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,639
we want to probe in the wild on random

744
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
prefixes

745
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,239
and actually we already have

746
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,040
some

747
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,359
let's call them earlier results and the

748
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,839
trend this is still to be confirmed and

749
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,960
the trend is that it's like

750
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
the same that we observed

751
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,918
some are improving some are not

752
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,960
but basically this is the same

753
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,639
we still have to test

754
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,359
a lot more because the more you test the

755
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,359
more complete you are and the more

756
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,159
representative uh you you are from the

757
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,359
the reality

758
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,079
of the entire internet

759
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,560
and as i mentioned earlier we are trying

760
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,960
also to improve the ice drop attribution

761
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
algorithm

762
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,879
so this is a work in progress

763
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,359
initially it was a student

764
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,160
responsible for this work for a semester

765
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,720
thesis but we have

766
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
taken taking it

767
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,040
now so

768
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,800
it's it's in progress in good progress

769
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
so you can find everything you want

770
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,280
about james we have gathered everything

771
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,359
on this repo

772
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,040
if you have any questions thank you

773
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,760
yeah nalini elkins inside products um

774
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,359
yeah i know this is very very

775
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,520
interesting i think we've talked a bunch

776
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,400
about this and it would be very

777
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
interesting to find out exactly why and

778
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,640
we're already collaborating because um

779
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,359
one of the things that we have seen

780
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,839
is that there are certain routers which

781
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,200
have bugs which keep hot by hop going

782
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
out at the source

783
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,880
and um so anyway so so what we're doing

784
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,920
is we're expanding our testing because

785
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,119
we have done some testing to see um you

786
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
know because we've had

787
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
i get our results are to the contrary

788
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
we've shown um large ftps succeeding but

789
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
we need to test more because you know

790
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
it's only from you know two or three

791
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,720
continents that we've done it and so i

792
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,119
think we all need to find out more about

793
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,320
exactly where and why

794
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,480
things are being dropped is it at the

795
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,320
destination network is it um bugs or you

796
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,760
know un uh

797
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,800
defaults quite what yeah yeah sure

798
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
because actually you can do a lot of

799
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
tests and they might succeed and so

800
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,720
that's why you need to test

801
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,279
as much as possible

802
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
is the line in front of me

803
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,119
no

804
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,240
uh okay uh jalenkova

805
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,240
sorry

806
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
oh please go ahead

807
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,560
no no no you're over first

808
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
okay uh can you go back a couple of

809
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,320
slides in the measurements uh slide

810
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
because i have a couple of uh you know

811
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,480
questions in there

812
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
which one the one with the results yeah

813
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,359
so i have a you know one question and

814
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,680
one comment the question is um

815
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
for the results for the routine headers

816
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,599
uh i would assume that you use the

817
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,440
what size did you use for the routine

818
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
headers

819
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,240
for the measurements because for the

820
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,000
other ones like destination options

821
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,480
you'd use different sizes and i would

822
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,880
expect that you'd get the same thing for

823
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,599
uh rooting headers too

824
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,320
um well you mean how many segments we

825
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
had it

826
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,240
yeah essentially what's the resulting

827
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,079
length of the extension header chain so

828
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,920
basically this is only one segment and

829
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
we also test it with

830
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,920
a basic one with zero segment

831
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,240
but we can for sure try to expand it to

832
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
see if there is a difference

833
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
because my expectation would be that the

834
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
results are going to be like similar for

835
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
destination options not necessarily the

836
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,800
same values but as you increase the size

837
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
and certainly when you hit like 64

838
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,359
you're going to see like big drops as

839
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,240
for destination options

840
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,280
and my comment is uh you were wondering

841
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,920
about the differences between um

842
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,760
you know the result for destination

843
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,119
options for using uh udp and tcp

844
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,119
uh the length that you have in the table

845
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,839
is for the size of the destination uh

846
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,400
options header itself right

847
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,359
yeah

848
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,599
only the only extension

849
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,520
for each types

850
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,480
yeah so my you know the my taking there

851
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
is that obviously the you know the udp

852
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,599
header size is smaller than the tcp one

853
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
so at the end of the day for the same

854
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,839
length of the extension header the

855
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,920
resulting you know length of the

856
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
extension header chain is going to be

857
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,760
longer for tcp

858
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,240
so at the end of the day what matters is

859
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
the result of the you know the the whole

860
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
length of the

861
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,280
ipv6

862
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,400
extension

863
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,800
the the ipv6 header chain

864
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
so for the same value of the length of

865
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,359
the extension header for this for tcp it

866
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
results in a longer extension header

867
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,119
chain that's why you get like higher

868
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,359
drop rates

869
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,720
yeah that would be an explanation

870
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
because you can see a shift of

871
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,960
one row between udp and tcp thank you

872
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,480
john linkova yeah

873
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
to follow our uh follow up on fernando's

874
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,200
comment for tcp you were sending syn

875
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
packets right

876
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,119
uh at the moment yeah so i guess here

877
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,200
the reason might be the router might

878
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,320
need to see syn flags and if your tcp

879
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
flags go with behind

880
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
the value router can

881
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
like like routers copy on cheap or

882
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
something like looking for the flags

883
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,400
they might just not see the packet as

884
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,359
being tcpc and then as a result drop it

885
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,160
so

886
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,520
what i'd like you to say is that esp is

887
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,560
actually a very good example proven that

888
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,839
extension header works when we need them

889
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,720
like when mobile phone makes a

890
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,920
wi-fi calling it's using asp right so

891
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,400
esp has a very good use in internet and

892
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
it works yeah so

893
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,359
all like in most cases we've seen packet

894
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,680
drops because there is no reason for

895
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,839
that packet to go through anyway right

896
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,240
so i think again when we saying that we

897
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,319
cannot use extension headers on the

898
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,640
internet we need to find good use of

899
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
them

900
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,640
which will be which would benefit

901
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,079
users

902
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,920
in general and then i guess the

903
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,760
situation will change yes obviously the

904
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,920
random packets are dropped

905
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,640
totally agree

906
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
third

907
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,520
we have the

908
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,839
mr code from the queue

909
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,640
elena he dropped from the queue so

910
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,920
we'll

911
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,359
switch to the next thank you

912
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,040
let me see if i can get this

913
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,280
uh

914
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,240
something you are on again

915
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,280
can you hear us

916
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,480
well maybe

917
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,079
i will do my presentation first

918
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
so because i need to run the slide

919
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
please allow me to

920
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,359
talk along here

921
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,760
actually the screen is showing

922
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,079
[Music]

923
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,040
thread

924
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
if you are online can you

925
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,640
stop the

926
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,359
stop the polling because my screen is

927
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,920
the polling and it's here so it's a

928
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,240
little very confusing but anyhow

929
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,119
this is our second version of the

930
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
draft

931
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,079
we basically proposed some guidelines

932
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,160
for enterprise to deploy

933
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,040
to deploy

934
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
ip

935
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,839
v6 first hop

936
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,560
well

937
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
it's not working so

938
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,640
bear with me i have to change to

939
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,880
keep hanging your audio is being lost

940
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,760
yeah it's because i need to switch to

941
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,800
says green otherwise i cannot control

942
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,599
the

943
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,079
slides it's very strange i'm still

944
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,240
seeing your

945
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,960
i'm still seeing your

946
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,400
the polling of my screen

947
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,279
yeah you folks are fine but

948
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,839
okay here my screen is still stuck with

949
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:22,800
this

950
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
polling i wonder why the screen

951
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
anyway let me see if

952
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,839
it looks better for my machine okay

953
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,078
so

954
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,959
we want

955
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,640
well

956
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,240
this one

957
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,799
this one yes

958
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,160
okay it works

959
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,280
for you

960
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,590
so

961
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,520
[Music]

962
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:09,880
we

963
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,839
[Music]

964
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
we made this uh

965
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,040
draft to provide some guideline for

966
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,920
enterprise and the reason we need that

967
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,000
can you go to the next page

968
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,040
is because over the time more than 30

969
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
ifc has been

970
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
proposed on the

971
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,880
on the

972
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,680
uh

973
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,000
for optimization solution for nd

974
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,359
it's not easy for people to

975
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,119
get all of these because there are so

976
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,280
many rfcs

977
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,599
and therefore

978
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,520
yeah so i am a little bit extracted

979
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,680
so i think that you know with so many

980
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,839
rfcs there are two issues the first

981
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,680
issue is that you know some people may

982
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
not know and they deploy the

983
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,440
the nd and the first hop and later they

984
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,400
find out and therefore when later after

985
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,160
you have already deployed you find a

986
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,040
problem and you need to fix it then

987
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,400
it's more difficult to change the other

988
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,599
issue is that you may

989
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,160
you may know and it may scare you that

990
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,000
oh you know there are so many excuses

991
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,400
therefore you know i would like to stop

992
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,800
and this is why we believe that having a

993
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,640
complete uh

994
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
summarizing all the issue is good

995
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,839
because

996
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,160
um

997
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,960
just like i have seen 90 uh

998
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,720
1999 in the past i met multiple

999
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
operators and they are concerned that oh

1000
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,079
ipv6 have a lot of security issues but

1001
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,520
once we

1002
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,880
say that all will have obviously 1999

1003
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,760
and it summarizes all the ipv6xcus

1004
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,280
and

1005
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,240
um we also provide solutions people feel

1006
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,800
much more comfortable and so this is

1007
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,200
what we are trying to basically do the

1008
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,040
same thing next slide please

1009
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,400
so in this uh draft we basically uh

1010
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
summarize all the nd issues known up to

1011
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,440
this point and in this version compared

1012
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,839
to the previous version a major

1013
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,559
improvement is that we now clearly

1014
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,319
separate the

1015
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,280
cause of the issue and the consequence

1016
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
because in the previous version we're

1017
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,680
kind of like you know we talked about

1018
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,440
multicast excel we talked about

1019
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,599
performance excel but many of the

1020
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,680
performance xu are actually caused by

1021
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,119
multicast so in this version we clearly

1022
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,599
separate out the cause and the

1023
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
consequence and there are really there's

1024
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,079
only three cause the first cause is

1025
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,400
multicast which can cause performance

1026
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,200
and reliability issue the second issue

1027
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,599
is that and the trust all the holes so

1028
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,000
if certain holes in a public access

1029
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,640
environment cannot be trust then you

1030
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,640
will have a problem this is some other

1031
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,680
issue and that's the third cause is that

1032
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,839
nce is uh installed on vmax and this can

1033
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,240
also cause some issue so in this version

1034
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,119
we make it much simpler to

1035
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,319
to

1036
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,839
uh

1037
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,559
to identify the cause and also if you

1038
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,280
can eliminate these three cores then you

1039
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,079
know many of your md issues will be

1040
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,839
eliminated next page please

1041
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,640
can we go through this one

1042
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,640
yes okay next page please

1043
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,480
so in after we summarize the course we

1044
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,960
talk we review all the

1045
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,720
uh

1046
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,960
optimization solution uh already

1047
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,480
published so first way we talk about you

1048
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,680
know each workout is a solution to and

1049
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,319
then we also uh

1050
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,520
point out

1051
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,559
which

1052
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,720
excel which is these solutions solve in

1053
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,680
the table in the table so for some

1054
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,319
enterprise people if you have a concern

1055
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,960
with a particular xu and you want to

1056
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,280
find out which solutions

1057
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,640
which solutions uh is capable of solving

1058
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,040
these then you know you can you can go

1059
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,760
for this table and you will know it next

1060
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
page

1061
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,160
so overall we also learned a lesson from

1062
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,800
all these uh solutions you know the

1063
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,920
solution didn't clearly talk about

1064
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,160
isolation but when we when we look at it

1065
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,640
they many of these solutions actually

1066
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,240
have a common thing

1067
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,040
which is to isolate holes to solve the

1068
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,800
issues and this is a good lesson and

1069
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,680
also from all these solutions we find

1070
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,119
out that

1071
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,760
there are four

1072
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,480
isolation methods appear in different

1073
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,640
drafts but we

1074
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,880
check them out

1075
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,960
basically these are the you know

1076
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,520
link isolation is separating holes in

1077
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,599
layer two and then there's also the

1078
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,720
subnet isolation which is to isolate

1079
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,359
holes giving these holes a different

1080
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,240
subnet graphics and then there's the gua

1081
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,000
we call it the gua

1082
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,680
isolation it's basically the original nd

1083
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,280
approach the nd approach which is to set

1084
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,960
the prefix pio the l-bit to zero

1085
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,920
in this case the host will not hold the

1086
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
communication with the gua

1087
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
will go through the router

1088
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,480
and will not communicate the host will

1089
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,599
not communicate directly but the lla

1090
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,160
they can still communicate directly this

1091
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,359
is why we call it the gua isolation and

1092
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,760
then there's also the proxy isolation

1093
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,359
which means that you know you have a

1094
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,520
proxy represent a group of holes and for

1095
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,599
other holes they will only see the proxy

1096
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,839
they will not see the individual holes

1097
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,200
in behind the proxy so this is also a

1098
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,760
point of isolation and with this four

1099
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
isolation method

1100
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,319
i you know if they are independent then

1101
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,880
there will be 16 combinations but we

1102
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,240
point out that they are actually they

1103
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,160
are not independent so

1104
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
long story short in the end there are

1105
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,119
only four meaningful uh combinations

1106
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,520
they are only four meaningful and the

1107
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,000
first one is the strongest and the last

1108
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,640
one is the least

1109
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,280
less strong

1110
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,079
so

1111
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,200
all of

1112
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
all of these will can we go to the next

1113
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,599
page

1114
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,760
we discussed that you know you can use

1115
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,040
these four combinations to

1116
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,559
isolate holes to isolate holes so in the

1117
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,119
draft first we discuss you know for each

1118
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,480
uh combination for each combination what

1119
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
are its applicability meaning that you

1120
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
know what is good for you know what is

1121
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,599
the

1122
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,440
what's the disadvantage

1123
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,319
um

1124
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,400
with the

1125
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,319
applicability with the applicability we

1126
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,880
then is playing for each

1127
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,119
application

1128
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,280
for each combination

1129
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,839
what is the

1130
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,200
applicable

1131
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,839
what is the applicable scenarios what

1132
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,760
are the entry requirements if you want

1133
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,880
to use this uh

1134
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,480
combination

1135
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
what are the what other requirements you

1136
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,440
must have and then you know after you

1137
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,680
use this combination what kind of issues

1138
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,440
are still remaining

1139
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,920
you know what you may need to

1140
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,640
do

1141
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,520
so for each basically for each of the

1142
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,960
combination we is playing all of these

1143
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
so these kind of like provide a

1144
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,200
systematic way for an enterprise

1145
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,880
for enterprise

1146
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,079
uh

1147
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,319
the scenario can be there are many

1148
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,640
scenarios and therefore you know by

1149
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,440
providing a systematic guidelines

1150
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
enterprise can kind of go through the

1151
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,880
list so that they can decide okay you

1152
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,000
know for my first hop what will be the

1153
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,359
best solution so this is the

1154
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,000
the idea of the draft we now believe

1155
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,880
that the drive is in a very good safe

1156
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,440
and we hope that people will

1157
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,480
will eat and provide a comment and at

1158
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
some point we probably want to ask the

1159
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,280
google

1160
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,440
the wg for adoption thank you

1161
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,760
obviously if you can as an isolate hosts

1162
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,000
on broadcast domain and slash 64 right

1163
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,079
all your problems solved great but we

1164
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,760
all know it's not always possible

1165
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,880
because

1166
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,040
hosts might want to talk to each other

1167
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,680
so my question is about what you called

1168
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,839
ga

1169
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,640
isolation

1170
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,839
it kind of means you trust in the host

1171
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,040
right

1172
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,520
but the whole idea is you're not

1173
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,640
supposed to what prevents a host to

1174
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,040
ignore albeit

1175
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,559
and just

1176
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:25,760
send a

1177
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,920
neighbor discovery quaker to its

1178
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,839
neighbor

1179
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,760
so if you are not providing actually a

1180
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,160
layer to isolation and you obviously are

1181
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,799
not providing kids because you cannot

1182
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,920
so i'm trying to understand what's your

1183
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,000
threat model and what kind of issues you

1184
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,599
are preventing

1185
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,559
by setting lb to zero

1186
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,960
are you assuming all hosts to do the

1187
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,839
right thing

1188
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,119
uh we

1189
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,079
please

1190
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,839
don't just look at this for example gua

1191
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,160
isolation you know kind of like by

1192
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,559
itself we are basically going through a

1193
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,599
list

1194
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,720
and starting from the strongest

1195
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,880
isolation therefore

1196
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,680
if you feel that all these holes cannot

1197
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,720
be trusted at all then you probably want

1198
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,760
the stronger you know isolation yeah

1199
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,920
it will not even get to the gua isolated

1200
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,839
yeah but quite often you cannot do this

1201
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,000
because hosts might need to talk to each

1202
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,240
other especially all these you know like

1203
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,000
special systems i'm not talking about

1204
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,079
laptops i'm talking about like building

1205
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,119
management systems and so on they must

1206
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,040
talk to each other so i'm basically

1207
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,480
trying to understand what kind of

1208
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,640
security and threat preventions you are

1209
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,839
getting by item number three because my

1210
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,440
understanding you are human good

1211
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,160
behavior the host in this case uh again

1212
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,280
you don't want get to if you get to gua

1213
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,240
isolation we will point out that

1214
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,480
the point out that you know it solves

1215
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,559
certain problems but there are other

1216
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,720
problems that it does not solve

1217
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,359
therefore you know if you are

1218
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,480
with the gua isolation you if you are

1219
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,799
concerned that the holes cannot be

1220
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,200
trusted then you may need to you know

1221
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,640
add the field ring etc to to deal with

1222
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,599
that so it's not that you know you get

1223
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,599
to a gua isolation and and zua isolation

1224
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,920
will take care of everything it's not

1225
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,839
what i would have said okay thank you

1226
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,160
and the second question if i may

1227
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,359
uh you i you mentioned you might need to

1228
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,000
have a proxy neighbor discovery proxy

1229
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,040
right

1230
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,359
as far as i know the existing rfc is

1231
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,839
kind of experimental

1232
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,640
do you rely on the behavior described

1233
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,280
there or you assume some other kind of

1234
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,720
behavior from proxy indeed

1235
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,480
we don't really

1236
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,040
assume anything we simply point out that

1237
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,920
you know uh in the market there's such

1238
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,000
you know proposal

1239
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,880
so we want to kind of like bring the

1240
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,240
awareness

1241
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,640
to the to the leaders and potential

1242
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,559
deployers like you know there are such a

1243
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,119
solution that you can you can consider

1244
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,799
yeah well sorry what i'm trying to say

1245
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,000
is proxy nd might not actually exist in

1246
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,240
most implementations or

1247
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,079
at least we do not have like standard

1248
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,960
rfc for that

1249
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,040
okay

1250
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,200
we we

1251
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,559
i'll look into that

1252
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,720
thinking more people in the queue cannot

1253
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,400
seem to be

1254
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,880
okay then we can go back to

1255
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,079
excellent and thank you very much

1256
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:38,880
so

1257
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,839
next

1258
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,720
is online now

1259
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,839
okay now can you hear me

1260
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,520
okay uh

1261
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,920
sorry for some small problem

1262
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,000
hello everyone uh thank you for giving

1263
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,599
me this opportunity to

1264
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,280
present the framework of multi-domain

1265
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,160
activities only analyze

1266
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,720
that slice please

1267
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,559
let's type

1268
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,599
okay this is the overview of the drafts

1269
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,880
in ihf 113 we presented the requirements

1270
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,599
to

1271
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,240
multi-domain activities only network

1272
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,160
based on the comments received the new

1273
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,960
draft focus on framework and the title

1274
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,440
has been cheap twice so this case is one

1275
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,400
draft

1276
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,799
multiple titles okay next slide please

1277
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,119
all right comments have been received

1278
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,440
from this ops all are appreciated

1279
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,160
next please

1280
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,240
uh since ietf 113 the following variants

1281
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,599
had been made

1282
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,920
uh the document architecture is

1283
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,000
adjusted to make the logic

1284
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,079
straight forward and the section of

1285
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,160
scenarios has been emerging to other

1286
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,880
sections based on the comments of sheep

1287
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,359
atp and some requirement items have been

1288
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,079
deleted we add uh illustration how new

1289
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,640
framework dos v for recess converge

1290
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,040
compared to other solutions we also made

1291
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,040
some editorial changes

1292
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,839
next slide please

1293
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,160
yeah this topic is about

1294
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,359
last

1295
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,480
operation of nascar uh networks

1296
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,480
multi-domain means network is composed

1297
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,559
multiple es and

1298
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,640
as mentioned last time different airs

1299
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,319
missed of different scenarios such as uh

1300
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,400
metro network backbone network footage

1301
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,880
of 5g mobile calls cloud data center

1302
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,200
network etc

1303
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,000
also there's so many activities and only

1304
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,480
techniques but

1305
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,720
challenges or issues are still met when

1306
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,599
playing fbs is only in networks i'll

1307
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,880
give some a

1308
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
brief introduction the first one is

1309
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,119
partial fpv is only deployment

1310
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,920
some domains ipvcs only and others are

1311
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,480
not the second one is unless three

1312
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,119
traffic winding when stateful v46

1313
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,880
gateway deployed as an edge of the

1314
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,200
backbone the next one is the visibility

1315
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
of the ordinary addresses this means

1316
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,359
that when as obviously

1317
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,839
b is used to encapsulation

1318
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,680
fpv for packaging activates its own

1319
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,799
network the old ipv kit contains no

1320
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,760
original ipv4 address information

1321
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,520
the next one is the consistent data

1322
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,799
format some domains use translation some

1323
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,119
domains encapsulation which so

1324
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,520
this would lead to excessive conversion

1325
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,480
gateways and the network complexity and

1326
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,359
last night please

1327
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
so there will need for monitoring pvc

1328
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,680
only solutions to eliminate unnecessary

1329
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,000
conversion functions improve

1330
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,079
data forwarding efficiency

1331
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,359
uh the following requirements should be

1332
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,200
met by the new framework they have been

1333
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,960
introduced last time so i think this

1334
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,119
part can be skipped over next night

1335
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,119
please

1336
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,559
for ipv4 service deliver all activities

1337
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,160
on the network ipv4 package uh will be

1338
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,040
transformed into ipv1 uh by translation

1339
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,359
encapsulation in ue or at the edge of

1340
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,559
the devices

1341
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,559
then the forwarding activity for data in

1342
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,400
the form ipv6 packet will follow

1343
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,040
topology this is network this is easy to

1344
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,480
understand right

1345
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,440
but in the new framework each pe

1346
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,160
id device will be identified by at least

1347
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,920
one ipv6 mapping prefix

1348
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,160
uh it will also have one or more

1349
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,880
associated ipv4 prefix which are

1350
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,760
extracted from local ipv4 working tables

1351
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,280
or dress posts

1352
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,119
the mapping relation between ipv4

1353
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,520
address block and ipv6 mapping prefix is

1354
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,000
called mapping rule in this framework

1355
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,520
the method will have at least the

1356
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,559
following uh data from structure ipv4

1357
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,559
address blog and activision mapping

1358
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,960
prefix and maybe include other

1359
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,280
information in the future so these

1360
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,599
mapping rules can be transmitted across

1361
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,720
domains

1362
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,119
it gives the direction and the egress of

1363
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,559
ibv for data transmission in

1364
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,960
multi-domain api basis on the networks

1365
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,839
using mapping rule exchange the egress

1366
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,720
pe compare rsp that if the destination

1367
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,039
address of ipv4 packet is within the

1368
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,799
scope of ipv4 address block of the

1369
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,280
mapping rules please send them to me

1370
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,760
so the ingress pe can use the mapping

1371
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,079
rule to generate the corresponding ipv6

1372
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,880
address by appending ipv4 address to the

1373
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,359
activities mapping prefix this works

1374
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,520
both for sales and destination address

1375
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,760
this kind of package called ipv4

1376
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,799
embedded activities package so we can

1377
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,280
see that ruby's mapping is prefix level

1378
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,839
mapping there is no need to

1379
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,920
maintain user related states or

1380
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,599
translation tables

1381
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:12,559
at the

1382
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,160
pe devices next please

1383
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,520
that's nice please

1384
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,599
so this illustrates the framework from

1385
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,160
the perspective adapting ep devices

1386
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,160
adapter is a function of entity in the p

1387
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,920
device which implements a conversion of

1388
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,359
ipv4 packs into ipv6 for ipv systems iqb

1389
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,119
for self delivery it has three

1390
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,640
components

1391
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,000
as in which is the first one is role

1392
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,520
management layer deal with the

1393
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,319
management american rules the manager

1394
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,119
the mapping rule database in a pe store

1395
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,680
all the mapping rule records it receives

1396
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,920
the interface with the adaptive rp is

1397
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,160
used for the exchanging a mapping rule

1398
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,839
with each other the interface with

1399
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,440
routing process layer is used for the

1400
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,359
transmission of mapping rules

1401
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,160
so the underlying rocking processing is

1402
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,240
in charge of the exchanging mapping rule

1403
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,480
with each other with other piece and

1404
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,119
it's related about information so to

1405
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,720
support the transformational mapping

1406
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,119
rule has rarely uh uh maybe the field

1407
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,520
b2b for uh plus protocol or other

1408
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,880
control protocols needed to be extended

1409
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,640
uh this forwarding layer provides

1410
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,720
floating function to lighting activity

1411
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,680
types mpv4 embedded fpvc package this

1412
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,960
framework is about both translation and

1413
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,119
encapsulation for ipv4

1414
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,200
data delivery

1415
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,078
next step please

1416
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,760
uh here i want to further illustrate the

1417
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,160
gap and how the new framework addresses

1418
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,839
the gap you know in ic

1419
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:50,240
5565 the software uh

1420
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,599
mesh architecture the software

1421
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,760
tunnel requires address or remote

1422
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,680
software in the pawn to be the same as

1423
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,839
the address of the bgp network right the

1424
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,920
bt network is used for the tunnel in the

1425
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,760
pawn this is okay for single domain

1426
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,480
network but in multi-domain networks for

1427
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,359
the gaming ipv4 address block the bgp

1428
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,839
desktop value of given domains are

1429
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:12,799
different

1430
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,799
but the ingress pe can only see the

1431
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,680
desktop address of asbi is a symptom

1432
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,839
and it is difficult to obtain the nest

1433
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,920
of address with other domain setup and

1434
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,079
to end cross-domain tunnels

1435
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,359
therefore the procedure in fc 5565 does

1436
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,599
not work well in a trans-core consistent

1437
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,520
multiple domains this has been mentioned

1438
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,079
in ifc 5565

1439
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,000
so here we should use the new framework

1440
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,559
to how to address this issue

1441
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,720
this is sample flow of ipv4 service

1442
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,359
delivery of activities only nla

1443
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,599
firstly uh the root response to the

1444
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,760
mapping prefix of the egress will be

1445
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,680
announced through the whole network

1446
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,400
so the ingress will know how to forward

1447
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,359
the activity packet to the egress

1448
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,839
secondly the mapping rule will also be

1449
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,920
exchanged between the lingua as the

1450
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
egress keys this step should precede the

1451
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,520
precise for data for data transformation

1452
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,839
otherwise the data already from ipv4

1453
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,280
packet will be dropped due to the

1454
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,920
absence of the fpv's mapping prefix

1455
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
corresponding to the

1456
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,240
designation ipv4 address

1457
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,160
certainly when our ingress p receive

1458
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,760
previous packet from client-facing

1459
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,880
interface it looks up in micro database

1460
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,640
to find the mapping rules which has

1461
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,200
matched the text destination active

1462
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,599
address then the increase pe

1463
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,400
uh must convert ipv4 destination address

1464
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,960
into ipv6 address using the mapping

1465
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,039
prefix and forward it to the egress pe

1466
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,760
uh this yeah with this new framework

1467
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,240
ipv4 embedded ibvc package can

1468
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,078
transverse multi-domains networks

1469
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,960
next month please

1470
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,920
we have conducted a conducted field

1471
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,799
trial

1472
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,160
between two cities uh in china one is

1473
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,480
using metro network virtual area network

1474
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,319
and another one is

1475
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,039
the cloud data centers the distance

1476
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,640
between the two cities is

1477
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
kilo 1700

1478
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
the field trail

1479
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,680
covers redo means metro area network

1480
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,720
we see

1481
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,680
every backbone network is es number is

1482
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,760
uh

1483
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,000
4134 and the cloud system networks mean

1484
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,480
for hard turn which are different

1485
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,680
domains

1486
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,280
the field trail actually the physical

1487
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,440
trail has no functional requirements to

1488
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,599
the heavy backbone the backbone only

1489
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,160
needs to know the passing of the rod

1490
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,640
corresponding to the mapping prefix

1491
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,319
so we deploy the pe devices uh which is

1492
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,799
adapt capable in the production networks

1493
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,319
uh different p are configured with

1494
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,559
different activities micro prefix

1495
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,240
they jointly create a multi-domain

1496
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,599
previous

1497
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,760
only network uh mapping rules are

1498
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,240
exchanged between p devices

1499
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,920
the network can speculative ipv's

1500
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,960
packing ipv4 embedded package it also

1501
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,400
can support the communication

1502
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,119
initiated from the outside so it's open

1503
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,839
based on the so based on the

1504
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,279
implementation and the trail

1505
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,080
nationalities

1506
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,719
based on the implementation in the trail

1507
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,279
we found that this framework works well

1508
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,839
it is scalable and can integrate with

1509
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,719
existing fpv only approaches such as

1510
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,520
four six four accelerate the addition uh

1511
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,359
this only activities only model can

1512
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,679
naturally be extended to

1513
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,198
to multi-domain that was operated by

1514
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,439
different operators right so

1515
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:42,960
uh next we

1516
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,080
will the first refinement document will

1517
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,198
be made

1518
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:50,238
uh to consolidate the requirements and

1519
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,719
further stabilize the text

1520
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,560
at 2d script that describes the

1521
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,759
framework

1522
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,679
we're also looking forward to receiving

1523
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,839
more comments and contributions as

1524
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,520
europe and

1525
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,960
we hope that can be adopted as a working

1526
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,560
group item

1527
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,719
thank you

1528
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,439
any question

1529
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,319
genuine collaboration i read the

1530
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,479
document and to be honest i'm slightly

1531
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,319
confused about the requirements because

1532
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,120
for example the first requirement says

1533
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,600
it should be beneficial for wider ipv6

1534
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,040
adoption i'm a bit confused how to

1535
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,640
find out if

1536
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,319
particular solution satisfies that

1537
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,920
requirement or not

1538
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,439
secondly yeah

1539
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,198
okay

1540
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,960
go ahead please secondly

1541
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,679
i am not sure why

1542
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,839
even mentioning sr v6 as a requirement

1543
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,759
because i not sure that we shall be

1544
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,759
mandating any particular technology

1545
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:54,640
right

1546
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,480
people might want to use

1547
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,679
some other

1548
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,920
uh technologies so i don't think it's

1549
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,280
like should be in the document and third

1550
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,840
like this document says no additional

1551
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,159
security compromises from risk

1552
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,920
assessment perspective it might be not

1553
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,480
true right you might agree to accept

1554
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,120
some risk if your risk assessment shows

1555
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,080
that benefits of the solution exceeds

1556
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,920
potential impact

1557
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,480
so i do not think it's fair to declare

1558
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,040
that solutions should not add any

1559
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,120
potential security issues

1560
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,040
thank you

1561
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,880
uh okay uh thank you uh

1562
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,000
gene uh

1563
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,560
for your first question uh actually uh

1564
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,280
for our network this is about only so

1565
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,520
our the purpose is to

1566
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,120
uh close ipv4 functionalities at the

1567
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,640
annual network

1568
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,719
so uh

1569
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,159
so the packet forwarding and uh

1570
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,520
routing will be advances based right

1571
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,400
of course we cannot uh

1572
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,880
we cannot suppose that all the service

1573
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,960
is ipv6 based

1574
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,239
because

1575
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,719
this is not under control operators so

1576
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,400
we hope that the network analyst should

1577
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,719
be activision-based so i think this will

1578
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,440
be helpful for uh ipv6 uh development

1579
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,360
uh as actually

1580
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,120
which has been done by some operators

1581
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,000
folks for example 4x4 athletes

1582
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,440
which have been done some operators

1583
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,600
which is closed the

1584
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,199
ipv4 after the uh networkly and ipv4

1585
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,280
services right so this is the first

1586
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,560
question and the second question about

1587
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,280
srv6 yeah i think this is the further

1588
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,719
discussion but

1589
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,600
from standpoint of our operators for

1590
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,159
example china telecom we think that uh

1591
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:46,320
srv6 is a very uh valuable and useful it

1592
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,159
simplifies the protocol architecture and

1593
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,480
it has been uh whether uh using many

1594
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,280
scenarios uh yes maybe a different

1595
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,800
operators have different understanding

1596
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,320
but we think this

1597
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,440
uh

1598
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,679
should be considered in this uh

1599
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,120
framework

1600
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,880
uh then the last

1601
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,560
next one is about the security right

1602
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,800
yeah uh in this module phase

1603
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,360
framework

1604
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,400
the key device mainly implements the

1605
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,280
microsoft management and the

1606
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,000
conversion between ipv4 and ipv6 package

1607
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,480
actually it's some kind of router right

1608
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,120
and under the convergence aesthetics

1609
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,679
there's no uh state maintained at the

1610
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,320
age of network so it

1611
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,400
does not introduce too much

1612
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,960
security issues

1613
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,400
to the whole network

1614
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,719
of course maybe the material exchange

1615
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,120
will be based on bgp net broker in the

1616
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,440
future but this is uh

1617
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,199
there's some maybe some issues which

1618
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,400
means based on

1619
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,280
bb4 uh protocol i think this can

1620
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,159
discussed in other future documents

1621
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,280
that's my answer thank you

1622
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,679
okay ron bonica juniper networks

1623
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,080
i have two questions uh i'm also

1624
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,679
confused by the requirements section

1625
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,679
the first question is

1626
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,040
for what networks are these requirements

1627
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,400
all ipv6 networks a few like china

1628
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400
mobile that you've just mentioned

1629
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,760
or

1630
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,480
maybe a class of them like

1631
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,239
provider networks

1632
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:32,480
the second question is about srv6

1633
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,320
i would like you to add text that

1634
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
explains

1635
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,840
why it is a requirement for srv6 to be

1636
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,040
available

1637
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,960
for networks that require neither

1638
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,159
traffic engineering nor vpn services

1639
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,199
uh

1640
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,560
thank you uh

1641
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,440
wrong

1642
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,199
uh

1643
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,800
actually uh

1644
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,280
the the first question is about

1645
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,800
uh

1646
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,719
what kind of network is talked about is

1647
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,080
this framework right

1648
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,920
yeah

1649
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,280
this is this uh this as the title shows

1650
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,199
that this many talks about

1651
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,559
um underlying network

1652
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,000
which of course would be based

1653
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
it should be ipv6 based and in the

1654
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,040
network

1655
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,800
uh maybe

1656
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,520
on an overlay layer some such as

1657
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,800
vpn and sd1 maybe some uh some overlay

1658
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,960
service which we can support do stack

1659
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,679
but

1660
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:36,080
uh from other network we should

1661
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,000
we think that it should be at dvd's only

1662
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,320
based

1663
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:45,520
yeah the second one is about srv6 uh

1664
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,320
uh

1665
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,199
as as i have mentioned that different

1666
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,719
people may have different

1667
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,040
uh understanding to these issues because

1668
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,880
as of this is a new thing right it is

1669
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,560
still in a stage of

1670
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,159
uh

1671
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,719
trail and maybe some

1672
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,120
deployment maybe some trail but i think

1673
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,360
this can be uh is a further discussion

1674
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,040
in the future i don't think this is a

1675
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,840
very cl uh srv6 um

1676
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,760
it's not closely related to the

1677
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,520
framework right now

1678
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,520
we can have discussed first discussion

1679
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,719
in the future do you think it is okay

1680
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,560
certainly uh there are other traffic

1681
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,840
engineering mechanisms srm pls

1682
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,640
um many networks don't require a traffic

1683
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,880
engineering mechanism at all

1684
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,960
so why why should they

1685
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,960
you know why should they be doing this

1686
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,400
um

1687
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,000
but in any event let's let's bring this

1688
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,320
to the list oh by the way no hats on for

1689
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,960
this comment

1690
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,120
okay yes i think

1691
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,040
yes this is a bigger topic

1692
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:49,960
about

1693
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,880
srv6rs and

1694
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,480
actually it's a

1695
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,480
separate talk topic

1696
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,000
uh

1697
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,320
we can discuss this uh offline if you

1698
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,880
think it is necessary

1699
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,640
folks we need to move on

1700
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,920
so please take the x-seal to the least

1701
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,520
and now in marie you are on

1702
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,920
marie can you hear us

1703
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,880
emery can you hear us

1704
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,600
so

1705
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,840
then we go to we move on to the next

1706
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,840
presentation

1707
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,840
okay

1708
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,120
i guess

1709
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,080
emery can you start

1710
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,360
you are muted

1711
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,159
can you hear me now

1712
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,480
okay perfect i can barely hear you

1713
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,960
so uh okay so thanks for the opportunity

1714
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,120
and sorry i can be with you all there

1715
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,000
in person enjoying that humid weather um

1716
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,719
so v6 domain transition i had the

1717
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,640
opportunity to lead since the transition

1718
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,159
for cisco.com uh next slide

1719
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,719
you are too loud so maybe a little bit

1720
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,360
away

1721
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,520
is it better

1722
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,199
i think so or so i think eric's going to

1723
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,679
go

1724
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,040
okay thank you

1725
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,640
thank you

1726
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,440
um so this is uh just an idea of the

1727
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,280
scale of the united

1728
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,880
so we had 33 top level teams

1729
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,920
we had 800 plus applications and by

1730
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,440
applications i mean

1731
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,920
uh external facing web apps these were

1732
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,640
not count this does not include the

1733
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,199
internal um applications

1734
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,360
and then the number that really stands

1735
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,880
out is the 69 authorizations we had to

1736
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
get the project was so large that we had

1737
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,000
to get 69 directors or senior managers

1738
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,120
to sign off on on the project and if

1739
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,880
they didn't then we none of us would

1740
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
have been able to move forward and i'll

1741
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,600
tell you why that was in a little bit

1742
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,760
the big win is that we enabled 40

1743
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,560
billion of cisco's annual run rate next

1744
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,880
slide

1745
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,040
excuse me so the the

1746
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,920
domain transition was very public it's

1747
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,159
obviously tracked it's very visible

1748
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,800
externally externally and internally and

1749
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,639
there was extremely high level of

1750
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,840
integrative efforts between

1751
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,000
applications and infrastructure teams

1752
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,520
and compute and network with the primary

1753
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,920
infrastructure teams the applications

1754
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,560
teams were again the business

1755
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,320
applications uh that had external facing

1756
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,599
web apps next slide

1757
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,920
so i picked a really sophisticated

1758
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,639
analogy for network infrastructure

1759
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,520
and how it integrates to ip enabled

1760
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,080
technologies

1761
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,719
next slide

1762
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,679
so the applications i want to check back

1763
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,560
into the applications ecosystem so

1764
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,760
again my focus is on um primarily going

1765
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,840
to be on the application side and how it

1766
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,560
integrated with network infrastructure

1767
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,800
so we have the systems management and

1768
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,040
that means that that you know the

1769
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,199
development test release

1770
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,120
and update

1771
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,520
system management applications

1772
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,000
the business applications themselves

1773
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,840
this could be

1774
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,000
the legacy

1775
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
on prime and of course web mobile and

1776
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,440
cloud

1777
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,520
and they all have

1778
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,440
and they're all split by

1779
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,679
different teams so multiple teams would

1780
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,639
have the same ecosystem for themselves

1781
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,440
they're not necessarily um

1782
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,799
centralized next slide

1783
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,920
and then we have the another layer is

1784
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,159
the application's life cycle

1785
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,120
so there's always a matter of legacy the

1786
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,719
ones that are live and the one the

1787
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,199
applications that are transitioning

1788
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,880
in the design process we have to worry

1789
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,120
about development and test environments

1790
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,480
and teams release

1791
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,920
systems and teams and management systems

1792
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,320
and teams

1793
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,799
next slide

1794
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,480
so the value so i'm really focusing on

1795
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,560
the business applications and because

1796
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,719
the value of the ip address can be

1797
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,440
direct or abstracted

1798
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,280
and we need to understand what the how

1799
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,440
how those business teams are

1800
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,000
are impacted by the value of an impa an

1801
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,679
ip address

1802
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:46,719
it also

1803
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,400
means that we have to really keep our

1804
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,360
evangelist hats on at all times because

1805
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,280
applications teams are not necessarily

1806
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,400
so

1807
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,239
immersed in the v6

1808
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,840
um world as as you all as we all are

1809
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,840
and they're constant we need to really

1810
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,520
reduce the creation of new legacy

1811
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,840
applications every day that we don't

1812
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,639
address these up the the

1813
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,520
applications then there's just new

1814
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,880
applications released and that just

1815
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,320
creates more legacy and more inertia

1816
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,080
and we obviously don't want to have dual

1817
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,360
stack maintenance it's just too

1818
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,440
expensive and complicated

1819
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,719
um

1820
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,080
and everything is just getting more and

1821
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,639
more complex as we you know as time

1822
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,760
moves on next slide

1823
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,280
so incremental so here's our

1824
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,400
sophisticated

1825
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,440
analogy and so i've circled every point

1826
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,840
where the network infrastructure would

1827
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,360
integrate with another ip enabled

1828
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,920
technology or application it could be

1829
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,880
another you know a harder soft so

1830
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,440
um every time we there's a red circle

1831
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,120
there then we have to figure out every

1832
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,280
time that water in this case network

1833
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,800
traffic flows

1834
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,920
then

1835
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,560
we need to just make a determination if

1836
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,440
we're going to

1837
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,159
enable the next chain the next section

1838
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,679
of pipe

1839
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,520
or are we going to

1840
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,080
find a way to to truncate it and not let

1841
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,760
the new traffic go

1842
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,239
so every time there's a new intersection

1843
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:19,040
there really needs to be a

1844
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,880
cross-functional determination of how

1845
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,800
you're going to handle that new traffic

1846
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,560
when it's entered when it's flowing out

1847
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,040
of the infrastructure and into its

1848
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,040
applications

1849
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,840
next slide

1850
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,120
the key challenges were um

1851
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,400
i'm going to stick with the shared

1852
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,000
infrastructure and organization

1853
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
evolution and global configurations if

1854
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,360
we have time i'll go into team best

1855
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,719
practices

1856
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,960
um but they're these that the three on

1857
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,600
the around the right the top and left

1858
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,760
sorry um are critical it's the next

1859
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,080
slide

1860
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,320
so the next couple of slides really

1861
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,280
shows how organizational evolution

1862
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,679
occurs as we all know it does but what

1863
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,360
does that do when we've got when they're

1864
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,360
all sitting on on the same network

1865
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,480
infrastructure the next slide

1866
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,280
so as businesses grow and evolve they're

1867
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,600
just adding more and more and those

1868
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,400
teams end up under new leadership new

1869
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,719
systems that they deploy but next slide

1870
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,800
but they all tend to still sit on the

1871
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,679
same

1872
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,719
um

1873
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,159
network infrastructure and so when we uh

1874
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,040
look think back to that 69

1875
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,600
authorizations that we needed to get

1876
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,159
um this is one of the primary reasons

1877
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,480
for that is because the more

1878
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,719
that more teams share the same

1879
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,960
infrastructure then you've either got

1880
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,159
you've got to make some deliberate

1881
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,120
decisions about

1882
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,639
do you take everyone do you try to

1883
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,960
convince everyone to go

1884
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,199
and if you've got shared uh i'm sorry

1885
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,280
global configurations anywhere in that

1886
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,480
infrastructure

1887
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,159
then you've either got to figure out are

1888
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,400
you going to bifurcate that by team or

1889
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,239
are you going to

1890
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,960
really try to eat that elephant hole and

1891
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,120
try to convince all of those teams to go

1892
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,639
at once because they're all going to be

1893
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,719
affected by whatever global configs you

1894
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,199
you've got and shared infrastructure so

1895
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,920
that's a very deliberate um

1896
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,800
decision that has an enormous impact on

1897
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,360
your ability to move forward at cisco

1898
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,239
you know i had the wind at my back i had

1899
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,080
cisco had a very

1900
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,800
strong inherent business reason

1901
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,840
for pursuing the way they did but you

1902
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,320
know finance retail

1903
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,840
health insurance

1904
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,520
marketing manufacturing they don't have

1905
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,199
that same driver

1906
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,600
so you know the ability to get all these

1907
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,320
teams to go once may not be as easy as

1908
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,719
it well wasn't it it wasn't easy but

1909
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,000
but um

1910
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,080
it may not have the same impetus that we

1911
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,840
had at cisco next slide

1912
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,080
um yeah let's just skip this because

1913
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,560
we're in in the interest of time so

1914
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,320
again just restating what i just told

1915
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,320
you

1916
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,159
um so the technology recommendations one

1917
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,920
of the few of the things that made us

1918
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,920
successful is that i got the all the

1919
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,120
teams together and that would be

1920
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,440
external and internal so i i was able to

1921
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,920
gather the our cloud providers

1922
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,679
and all the key architects on the

1923
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,560
applications and the infrastructure side

1924
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,120
and we we traced the ip address from

1925
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,520
this point of origination to the next

1926
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,840
hop where did it go what happened to it

1927
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,120
where did it go from there what happened

1928
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,840
to we walked and we walked that through

1929
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,280
all the way through the systems and we

1930
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,920
were able to really reduce our risk by

1931
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,080
following that process

1932
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,080
again global configurations are really

1933
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,679
going to be important

1934
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,000
um again do you bifurcate them and and

1935
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,560
meet and uh have your configurations

1936
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,120
like your traffic profiles meet uh uh

1937
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,199
be specific to a team or do you just

1938
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,800
take them all the teams at once and hope

1939
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,639
you can get them all to sign off

1940
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,520
um the method for flow transition again

1941
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,520
every single time there's a connect

1942
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,000
connection where the v6 traffic is going

1943
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,719
to bump up against another uh set of

1944
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,360
pipes that may or may not be enabled

1945
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,440
you have to come up with a transition

1946
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,440
mechanism to make that happen

1947
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,760
um and then we didn't go over the teams

1948
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,040
but another

1949
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,360
got you was security parity with the

1950
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,040
floor and those offshore offices you

1951
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,719
can't always control

1952
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,800
uh what they what happens in offices you

1953
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,960
don't control

1954
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,320
obviously um uh and so applications

1955
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,120
teams are constantly rolling on and off

1956
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,199
projects they're much more dynamic in my

1957
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,520
experience than infrastructure teams are

1958
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,400
so that makes it a lot busier and having

1959
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,639
to meet that the

1960
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,800
requirements for those teams

1961
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,239
um another thing i didn't put on the

1962
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,520
slide but

1963
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,400
um

1964
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,080
happy eyeballs

1965
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,199
is

1966
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,000
a fantastic tool

1967
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
but the applications teams aren't so

1968
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,560
familiar with it and so when it comes to

1969
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,280
your release window

1970
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,000
and you've got

1971
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,159
applications

1972
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,440
teams

1973
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,400
who are looking for consistent results

1974
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,080
before they sign off on something when

1975
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,080
they're doing their release window

1976
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,560
and the behavior expected behavior of

1977
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,320
happy eyeballs occurs

1978
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,880
that can take make them see

1979
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,280
a little nervous and so i

1980
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,639
these are not they may not get

1981
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,120
consistent results with v6 so

1982
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,719
um i had the good fortune of having

1983
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:29,440
andrew yurichenko on my release window

1984
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,440
but you know not everyone has that

1985
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,960
benefit so

1986
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,159
um

1987
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,320
he's still my personal hero so

1988
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,840
um that's something that you'll have to

1989
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,679
look out for with applications teams and

1990
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:40,880
getting them familiar when you're

1991
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
wearing your evangelist hat getting them

1992
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,639
familiar with the behavior of the

1993
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,040
expected behavior of happy eyeballs

1994
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,679
next slide

1995
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,159
um yeah so in terms of how the ops

1996
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,560
working group can can help this process

1997
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,320
is is developing a set of

1998
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,560
recommendations for

1999
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,159
handling that shared network

2000
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,400
infrastructure in the and the

2001
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,040
global configurations um we can't do

2002
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,639
everything but having some um high level

2003
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,560
recommendations on where those points of

2004
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,000
integration are and how do you go about

2005
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,520
managing the global configuration so

2006
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,000
that you can be more incremental in your

2007
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,440
transition

2008
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,239
um

2009
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,800
the key applications

2010
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,000
um i i anyone who's talked to me from

2011
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,239
any you know in 30 seconds on this knows

2012
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,400
that i i'm very strong about getting

2013
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,679
non-hight

2014
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,600
decision makers involved in this process

2015
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,679
because of budget i think we're at a

2016
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,360
point where we need them to partner with

2017
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,600
us in order to move this forward so it's

2018
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,400
really

2019
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,600
important to understand what those key

2020
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,600
applications are meaning which ones can

2021
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,040
we tie to revenue

2022
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,199
and uh and and how do you get those to

2023
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,080
move forward for the your transition

2024
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,320
um

2025
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,800
and the recommendations for those points

2026
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,199
of integration identifying the high

2027
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,199
level where those points might be and

2028
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,040
then developing some recommendations for

2029
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,920
how those are are handled

2030
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,800
i think that's it

2031
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,519
okay questions

2032
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,280
so i have a question

2033
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,800
from

2034
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,280
your leading of you know six codes from

2035
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,040
ipv4 auto ipv6 corporate network as the

2036
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,560
program manager what do you feel is the

2037
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,400
the most challenging thing um what

2038
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,040
you have some some kind of like lessons

2039
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,960
or you know insight

2040
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,080
that you want other enterprise to to do

2041
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,040
for example do you feel that you know

2042
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,679
the the difficulty is just get started

2043
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,520
once you get started you will always

2044
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,880
reach that or you know before you start

2045
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,800
you really should know these and know

2046
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,440
that and maybe do this preparation and

2047
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,000
do that otherwise you know

2048
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,159
you you can start but you may never get

2049
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,440
to the destination

2050
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,719
um

2051
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,120
at this point i i think that it's

2052
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,560
important to get

2053
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,159
those uh other teams that may not be so

2054
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,239
involved in your v6 transition i mean we

2055
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,639
really need to move this forward so in

2056
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,639
terms of enterprise

2057
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,800
um

2058
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,600
uh yeah i think one of the key reasons

2059
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,960
we were successful at cisco was

2060
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,920
um

2061
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,000
they had already have a

2062
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,679
process called primes and so they had

2063
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,120
already identified they already had

2064
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,960
working relationships with

2065
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,000
the prime contacts in those key business

2066
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,199
areas so that really helped in that

2067
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,719
you know when we built our communication

2068
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,080
strategies

2069
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,320
um when we had our

2070
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,120
our

2071
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,520
communications uh

2072
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,159
announcements it was really a lot easier

2073
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,000
knowing that we had the support of those

2074
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,800
key

2075
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,320
um uh

2076
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,639
contacts in those areas that would have

2077
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,239
been much more difficult to get and they

2078
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,040
were key in getting the 69 sign-offs it

2079
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,040
wasn't me getting all of them it was

2080
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,440
partnering with those those those other

2081
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,879
teams and getting that done

2082
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,800
they need more questions

2083
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,960
if not thank you emily

2084
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,360

alibaba

2096
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,879

tools like maps it's a more than one

2104
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,400
billion users in china and

2105
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,320
three

2106
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,119
305 million international users out of

2107
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,800
china

2108
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,119
in addition alibaba also served as a

2109
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,960
cloud infrastructure

2110
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,520
including idc covering 28 regions with

2111
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,480
85 available zones globally

2112
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,719
and provide city and services these

2113
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,119
services and cloud services

2114
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,119
large and small businesses develop their

2115
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,119
services and build its own application

2116
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,199
based on cloud platform

2117
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:14,519
next slides

2118
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,119
first i would like to briefly introduce

2119
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,679
the timeline the faces of ipv6 options

2120
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,119
in alibaba

2121
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,320
um the first phase i referred as to

2122
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,400
research and preparing faces during the

2123
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,960
2012 and

2124
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,960
2017 people do evaluation

2125
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,199
experiments and small iq six trial

2126
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,440
projects inside this company

2127
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,840
people think ip6 is good

2128
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
but not ready for commercial and

2129
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,159
production of network so

2130
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:48,239
during the period between 2018 and 2019

2131
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,119
alibaba started the ipv6 program to

2132
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,880
enable its co-application and

2133
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,960
infrastructure to support ipv6

2134
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,960
carefully for each step

2135
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,239
the ipv6 active users start growing

2136
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:05,920
i call this space as to small scale ipv6

2137
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,239
commercial adoption

2138
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:10,320
for the past two years after i joined

2139
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,639
this team people have confidence and

2140
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:15,600
started to enable a larger scope of

2141
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,480
um

2142
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,679
to enable

2143
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,159
large scope of apps regions

2144
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,480
and cloud platforms based on the

2145
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,440
experience gained in early phases the

2146
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,639
number of ipv6 users are sorry and if

2147
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:31,040
you seek traffic the ratio increases as

2148
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,840
well

2149
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,080
you may notice the figures in the

2150
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,159
in the slides

2151
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,239
i call this face at the ipv6 fully

2152
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,040
deployment and now we reach 1 billion

2153
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,080
ipv6 active users globally and have

2154
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,560
achieved over 90 percent active state

2155
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,119
traffic ratio in recent months we test

2156
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,800
it every week

2157
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,360
the next target in the coming years is

2158
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,280
to offer no no not next time

2159
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,440
uh

2160
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,679
oh yeah yeah the next target of the

2161
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,679
coming years to offer ipv6 online

2162
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:05,760
capability for the users

2163
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,560
who only has ipv6 network

2164
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,440
okay next slides

2165
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,520
when we're talking about the motivation

2166
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,840
um i think that there are three things

2167
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,280
are common and the price of ipv6 ipv4

2168
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,840
address are growing rapidly in

2169
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,960
the people

2170
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,080
doing ipv56 of most of our salute is

2171
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:26,960
that

2172
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,080
and

2173
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,199
uh the government mandates um i notice

2174
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,719
u.s has some mandates in china also has

2175
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:35,920
the mandate

2176
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,520
uh to

2177
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,880
uh to pop to to issue out the plans and

2178
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,119
policies to encourage enhance the

2179
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:46,159
widespread adoption of ipv6 for

2180
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:49,199
protection network and services and it

2181
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,440
also creates some

2182
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,920
market space for for the customer who

2183
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,800
also

2184
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,320
uh need to

2185
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,280
follow the plans and mandates and the

2186
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,520
customer uh

2187
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,480
requires the ipv6 capabilities during

2188
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,639
the process

2189
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,119
and the third one is ipv6 innovations

2190
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:12,000
and new capabilities uh there are a team

2191
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,600
of uh inside of uh our campaign i focus

2192
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,679
on that software defined network based

2193
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,520
on srv6

2194
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,520
towards a fine-grained network services

2195
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,960
for application

2196
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,600
uh as to the general challenges for

2197
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,560
online services uh the stability uh

2198
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,920
accessibility and risk issues

2199
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,159
is a matter of primary

2200
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,320
importance for large scale online

2201
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,400
services

2202
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,159
and the language infrastructure must

2203
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,960
support new services we cannot stop and

2204
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,159
wait for ipv6 adoption and should it

2205
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,880
introduce complexities risk and

2206
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,719
additional works for us

2207
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:53,440
when alibaba started its ipv6 commercial

2208
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,400
adoption in

2209
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:00,960
in 2000 uh in 2008 early year early 2008

2210
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,679
the end-to-end network is not ready for

2211
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,280
ipv6 commercial you use compared to ipv4

2212
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,760
so it also adds some challenges

2213
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,159
uh in addition it's not easy to

2214
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,400
coordinate to uh

2215
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,520
uh 10

2216
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,920
20 different business units and more

2217
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,960
than 500 engineers work for

2218
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,239
for uh one project so uh

2219
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,239
in the following slides i will focus on

2220
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,239
some technical considerations for

2221
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,719
engineers uh the first the first and the

2222
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,239
primary uh technic challenge is how to

2223
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,880
migrate online services smoothly uh

2224
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,400
without interference of users and opera

2225
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,880
applications the second second one um

2226
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,920
a sub sub challenge is how to measure

2227
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,719
the quality of ipv6 network and adobe

2228
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,520
adopting new stack environment

2229
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,360
and i will also talk about the small

2230
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,040
technical considerations regarding the

2231
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,920
ipv6 mtu

2232
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,400
next slides please

2233
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,360
to better understand how to enable ipv6

2234
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,199
for online services in this page there

2235
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:09,360
is a very high level online services

2236
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,719
architecture

2237
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,639
you can see there too there are three

2238
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,400
parts one is

2239
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,159
the user side

2240
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,040
application of browser es and isp

2241
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,520
network they are supposed to support

2242
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,840
ipv6 in the first place

2243
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,119
uh extensive airflow has been taken uh

2244
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:28,000
uh

2245
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,679
uh taken on uh taken in in in the

2246
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:35,199
alibaba team to enable apps to adapt to

2247
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,119
that new stack uh

2248
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,199
i will talk about it later the second

2249
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,760
part is the access point of application

2250
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,199
um which receive ipv6 uh connections

2251
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:48,400
from users go through security checks

2252
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,400
and deliver it to the best application

2253
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,679
servers which handle the connections

2254
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,040
it should be

2255
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,440
upgraded to provide public

2256
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,880
facing services

2257
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,280
and we also have third party is the

2258
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,239
cloud services for cloud vpc users there

2259
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,639
are inner facing services some people

2260
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:09,360
hope

2261
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,080
that ipv6 only induction in interface

2262
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,159
facing services will release the scratch

2263
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:15,440
of ipsec

2264
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,760
for private address use

2265
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,520
but it's not highly priority right now

2266
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,480
okay next slice

2267
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,320
from the cloud platform view platform

2268
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,239
view point of view there are three

2269
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,080
solutions for different user

2270
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,719
requirements

2271
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,679
the first one is the proxy solutions in

2272
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,320
alibaba cloud we adopt uh

2273
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,480
some solutions like the global

2274
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,960
accelerators which enable the ipv6

2275
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,840
capabilities for public efficient access

2276
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,760
no change are required for the legacy

2277
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,520
infrastructure

2278
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,440
for users who already deploy their

2279
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,119
services on the cloud uh they can choose

2280
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:57,840
the

2281
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,360
load balance of four to or six to four

2282
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,920
or dual stack or six to six

2283
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,040
uh load balance just as alibaba apps do

2284
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,440
now edible cloud has full

2285
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,600
capabilities of new stack

2286
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,320
uh generally the idea is to we we want

2287
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,679
to decouple the ipv6 adoption on public

2288
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,639
facing ipv6 services and the legacy

2289
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,560
application

2290
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,119
uh the ultimate goal

2291
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:29,040
uh in our plan is to enable ipv6 for all

2292
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,040
apis and system calls for each

2293
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,199
transactions

2294
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,520
including the cloud services

2295
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,080
next slide

2296
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:41,920
okay let's focus on the major technic

2297
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,320
challenge i proposed uh in previous

2298
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,520
slides how to migrate online services

2299
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,560
smoothly uh firstly we should uh

2300
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,679
understand the quality of ipv6 network

2301
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:56,639
now nowadays we have in alibaba we have

2302
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,080
application performance management

2303
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,040
platform looking to the status of ipv6

2304
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:04,480
network performance in this page uh

2305
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,600
there are some

2306
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,639
metrics like tcp success success rate

2307
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,040
rtt ipv6 carriage coverage and

2308
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,000
some broken wifi issues

2309
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,440
from the tcp

2310
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,000
success rate and rtt we can find that in

2311
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,440
the early phase

2312
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:24,960
of like the early 2018 the end to end

2313
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,360
network is not ready for commercial use

2314
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,880
uh we have uh we have 17 only 75 success

2315
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:31,760
rates

2316
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,280
uh and uh almost 215

2317
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,080
microseconds uh in the early 2018.

2318
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,960
so

2319
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,920
uh by the efforts of uh john air force

2320
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,639
with china chinese isps like china

2321
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:49,119
telecon and mobile alibaba optimize the

2322
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,600
end-to-end ipv6 performance and reach

2323
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,639
the requirements of commercial services

2324
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,159
today

2325
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:59,119
the coverage of ip6 is also a very

2326
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,199
important uh matrix

2327
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:04,080
in the early of in the early

2328
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,159
in the early months of this year it's

2329
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:11,119
around this 90 percent and almost uh

2330
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,520
widely deployed in the mobile lte

2331
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,280
network the coverage is very narrow in

2332
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,320
wi-fi access network we also notice that

2333
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,080
in the dual stack wi-fi network many

2334
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,239
users may experience phoenix due to the

2335
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:25,520
broken wi-fi routers or routing settings

2336
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,840
there are many

2337
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,000
failure cases we connect next slides

2338
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,080
okay

2339
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,159
um

2340
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,199
okay generally we do uh stream errors on

2341
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:44,080
on the apps when we uh when we find it's

2342
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,960
okay to open the ipv6 for each users for

2343
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,840
each group of users

2344
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,000
uh firstly we we do measurement to pre

2345
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,679
detect the quality of fp6 network as i

2346
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,040
introduced uh previously and the second

2347
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,360
one is the push configurations and

2348
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,159
content to specific use groups based on

2349
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:09,040
different factors like geolocation

2350
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,639
uh the the annual ios platform or isp

2351
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:13,840
networks

2352
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,600
the third

2353
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,840
and improved i happy eyeballs

2354
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,000
implementation adopted using

2355
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,880
uh we combine the dns response with a

2356
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,639
quarter a and a

2357
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,159
we also push

2358
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,719
the priority priority

2359
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,880
address list by the server and we

2360
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,679
maintain the state of each ip port

2361
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,360
protocol

2362
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,360
tuples other than just the ip

2363
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,840
next

2364
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,080
slides uh to increase ipv6 uh ratio uh

2365
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:50,239
for for the apps for example the table

2366
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,639
app for example we make a list of domain

2367
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,119
to be ipv6 enabled

2368
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:58,000
there are more than 500 domains in

2369
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,440
taobao for example are priorities set

2370
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,760
to first to enable the cdn domains and

2371
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,760
domains related to resource on the first

2372
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,560
page for example the apps also

2373
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,440
pre-pool ipv6 address of domains if they

2374
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,480
can use ipv6 it works well to mention

2375
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,480
the behavior of apps in the dstack

2376
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,960
environment when the ipv6 is allowed to

2377
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:19,920
use

2378
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,400
in the early phase of ipv6 adoption 30

2379
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,600
minutes penalty was set for each ipv6

2380
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,600
phoenix because at that time the early

2381
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,080
phase the the net that the quality of

2382
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,480
ipv6 network is poor

2383
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
in order to increase the

2384
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:38,159
the traffic ratio of ip6 we uh we tried

2385
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:41,280
the uh the app tried the ipv6 first and

2386
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,000
fore back to ipv4 you finished it works

2387
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,840
good for mobile network

2388
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,880
but for back recently in broken wi-fi

2389
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,800
situations now we release ipv4 and v6 in

2390
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,159
a connection attempt to delay uh

2391
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,800
300 microseconds and

2392
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,920
as a happy elbows suggested so with

2393
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,719
these approaches uh many alibaba's

2394
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,600
applications including taobao are

2395
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,960
reached on more than 90 percent of

2396
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,480
basic traffic ratio in mobile tier lte

2397
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:18,000
network next slides please

2398
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,360
okay there is one issue that we are

2399
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,560
talking recently regards to the ipv6

2400
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,119
mtu we all know that um ipv6 parkit is

2401
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,920
prone to be dropped due to the meter box

2402
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,960
like fireworks and nets etc to avoid

2403
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,159
finish caused by pv6 package job years

2404
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,719
ago my colleagues choose a very product

2405
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,000
value for the ipv6 mtu

2406
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,880
and tcpmss as we show in the slides

2407
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,719
which decrease the transmission

2408
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,280
efficiency compared with ipv4

2409
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,639
and now we are going to test and

2410
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:57,280
implement larger ipv6 mtu and tcp mss

2411
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,159
in cydia environment

2412
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,799
next slides

2413
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,040
okay uh

2414
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,239
five years ago in 2017

2415
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:11,119
i was invited by the epic to post

2416
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,400
to write a post on ipv6 in china in that

2417
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,199
post i summarized the state quotes and

2418
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,800
they identified

2419
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,679
uh speed bumps of ipv6 at that time five

2420
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,320
years later where are we now i just

2421
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,360
compare uh what i post

2422
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,880
uh in the in the in that post and we

2423
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,600
found that we have good news and aspects

2424
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,639
good expect that a fully connected ipv6

2425
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,639
production network has been built

2426
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,360
because at that time five years ago um

2427
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,560
the ip6 network is fragmented and some

2428
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,920
trials and isil and an island

2429
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,920
and ipv6 uh penetration is over 90

2430
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,880
percent

2431
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,639
from the view of alibaba's apps where

2432
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:57,920
lte network but it's poor in the wi-fi

2433
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,679
network

2434
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,639
v6 traffic increase uh

2435
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:06,400
uh from the authority data are more than

2436
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,520
uh

2437
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,560
14

2438
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,520
in lte network and 10 percent in

2439
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,960
uh the main

2440
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,639
network the ipv6 performance is almost

2441
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,440
close to ipv6 uh before and better than

2442
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,800
ipv4 in some cases we do we did some

2443
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,080
tests on inside alibaba

2444
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,320
and we found that this stack is proved

2445
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,840
to be the best approach of adopting ipv6

2446
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,800
uh adopting fpv6 yes

2447
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,280
uh there are also some better aspects

2448
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,679
the last mail issue still exists we

2449
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:41,920
still have long tail user side network

2450
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,239
to be upgraded

2451
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:47,679
and ipv4 address price the hertz more

2452
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,040
and more

2453
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,719
and your stack may

2454
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,520
last for a long time due to legacy

2455
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,719
network and assistance so it's very hard

2456
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:59,840
in short time to relieve the ipv

2457
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,400
for address price burden

2458
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,159
uh currently i have

2459
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:07,440
i i didn't notice any plans or pass

2460
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,599
in the community to some third ip4 maybe

2461
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:12,800
i missed something uh important next

2462
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,199
slides

2463
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:19,199
next slide yeah okay uh as a conclusion

2464
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:22,960
uh i think ip6 is fully mature and

2465
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,480
alibaba's in upgraded in infrastructure

2466
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,960
and application in less than five years

2467
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,599
and now enable 1 billion and 96 users

2468
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:32,719
globally

2469
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:33,599
um

2470
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:35,520
we notice that stability and risk

2471
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,480
control are crucial considerations for

2472
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,920
online scale

2473
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,239
large-scale online services however i

2474
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,800
put a lot of effort to ensure the smooth

2475
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,719
transition and the farmer paths to

2476
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:50,560
deploy at v6 in last year

2477
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,920
k5p6 in considerations in the first

2478
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,159
place because upgrading language

2479
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,480
infrastructure is

2480
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,760
very

2481
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,280
hard and

2482
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,239
uh hurts a lot it's much more

2483
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,880
complicated than a new one so

2484
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,679
uh

2485
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,080
in alberta cloud new products and new

2486
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,199
version products are now required to

2487
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:18,159
support ipv6 capability as a waiter

2488
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:20,000
um

2489
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,800
so the next uh conclusion is that the

2490
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,360
two stack is the only approach we proved

2491
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,760
that however

2492
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,800
i think from pleasant view uh the ipv6

2493
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,800
community should consider a calm down

2494
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,560
timer uh for ipv4 because

2495
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,880
they're obvious obvious that ipv4 and v6

2496
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,480
are competing in some use in some cases

2497
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,040
the users

2498
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,040
have the

2499
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:53,280
presentations to adopt ipv6 if ipv4 is

2500
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,760
still available so that's the my

2501
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,040
observations

2502
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,280
uh that's all for my presentation thank

2503
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,280
you

2504
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:03,520
thank you

2505
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,560
for your own

2506
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,040
yeah

2507
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,679
any questions

2508
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:18,080
um yeah

2509
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,440
you

2510
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,159
mentioned that there is no sunset plan

2511
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:24,080
for ipv4

2512
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:27,040
and that the ipv6 community should

2513
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,119
consider a countdown timer

2514
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,440
for ipv4

2515
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,678
um

2516
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,920
now lee howard

2517
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,199
has spoken a couple of times trying

2518
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:43,360
targeting a sunset sunset plan for ipv4

2519
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,040
and people have kind of said we're not

2520
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,280
ready for that yet are you saying that

2521
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,239
alibaba is

2522
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,320
uh i'm not saying that

2523
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,639
alibaba will will count down the time uh

2524
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,639
from from my

2525
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,520
observations and this uh some experience

2526
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,159
from the new stack adoption

2527
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:09,360
uh it's very key for the client

2528
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,440
client side i mean

2529
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,800
the users

2530
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,320
most of users

2531
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,760
migrate to the to the ipv6 or do stack

2532
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,840
then the service provider or content

2533
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,320
provider

2534
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,520
should

2535
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,480
make most likely to follow the step that

2536
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,920
that's this uh

2537
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,119
successful

2538
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:35,199
uh pass for the dual stack deployment i

2539
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,760
i think a personal thing that it's also

2540
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,960
a good path

2541
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,040
uh firstly to sunset ipv4 in the

2542
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,440
in the end in the user side you will

2543
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,920
decide access network for example the

2544
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,320
lte network

2545
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,199
and then uh

2546
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:57,598
maybe the time for the icps yeah

2547
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,080
i don't see the users uh in any hurry to

2548
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:05,360
uh sunset ipv4

2549
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,239
yeah yes that that's the question i just

2550
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,960
proposed how weird this chance

2551
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,000
if we maintain the new stack

2552
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,239
there

2553
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:20,679
their new set is always there

2554
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,760
okay robbie

2555
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,040
hello linda

2556
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,960
please go ahead

2557
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:01,480
well if not mike you can go ahead

2558
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,480
hi mike ackerman first off thanks for

2559
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,159
doing a great presentation and we need

2560
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:10,879
more like this

2561
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,800
early on in your presentation you

2562
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,800
mentioned that the motivation

2563
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,159
for going to ipv6 included v4 pricing

2564
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:21,840
can you elaborate on what that means a

2565
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,760
little bit

2566
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,760
oh

2567
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,280
and the big

2568
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,440
the big and

2569
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:32,080
the campaigns big companies and

2570
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:35,119
platforms like cloud platforms companies

2571
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:37,679
they need ipv4 address

2572
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:38,400
to

2573
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,920
to to scale

2574
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,639
the network to provide services for

2575
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:43,599
their

2576
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:45,199
customers

2577
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:47,280
they continued to buy ipv6 from the

2578
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:50,239
market that the price saw

2579
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:54,000
uh maybe you noticed that uh or not that

2580
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,320
the the one one

2581
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,840
one uh that they're they're full 15 15

2582
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,599
dollars for for each ipv4 address

2583
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:06,320
as far as i know it's reached that high

2584
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,599
yeah

2585
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,560
did you have to buy more blocks of ipv4

2586
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,840
addresses

2587
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,880
to support legacy users or

2588
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,119
any special situations

2589
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:19,520
so i'm really asking if there's hard

2590
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,040
dollar costs there for you

2591
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,159
uh their address uh

2592
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,520
provide

2593
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,040
for new services

2594
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,000
and

2595
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,440
your network

2596
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,679
will increase the size right you you

2597
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,280
need to open more

2598
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,840
uh public services for for for your

2599
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:40,840
accounts a customer

2600
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,520
uh there are there are many situations

2601
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,199
that you need

2602
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:46,480
public typing

2603
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:48,000
address i think

2604
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,080
i mean

2605
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,320
okay that makes sense and one of your

2606
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:56,639
other driver factors was v6 capabilities

2607
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,480
other than the number of addresses can

2608
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,800
you elaborate on what the additional

2609
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,360
capabilities that attracted you to v6

2610
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,598
were

2611
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,599
uh

2612
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,800
yeah actually i'm not a very uh

2613
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,760
ex has expertise on the on the on the

2614
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,520
extensions of the six um

2615
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,639
uh

2616
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,800
but another group of

2617
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,440
of our team uh they are focused on how

2618
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:26,639
to leverage the uh the option extension

2619
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:30,880
options of ip6 uh the segment routing to

2620
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,920
to to build a software defined

2621
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,040
uh

2622
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:39,760
a way approach to better choose the past

2623
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,040
that's how

2624
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,760
how we we're looking forward that the

2625
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,040
more traffic can migrate to ipv6 then we

2626
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,360
can do the scheduling uh for each

2627
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,679
applications uh

2628
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,719
yeah that's why we that that the current

2629
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,920
talking right now is to increase traffic

2630
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,000
if that if though if there is no

2631
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,520
trafficking in the network how you

2632
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,880
there's no requirement no urgent

2633
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:11,599
requirement to use that capability

2634
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,599
okay that's fine then that makes sense

2635
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:16,719
thank you for that info again

2636
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:22,320
robbing are you still want to speak

2637
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,839
shanghai

2638
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:34,280
even though the chongqing will go to you

2639
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:47,280
can you hear me

2640
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,639
yes

2641
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:51,520
okay i have one question about uh

2642
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,320
activities only for cloud data centers

2643
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,920
you have mentioned that activities only

2644
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,840
will be the ultimate stage

2645
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,280
of uh

2646
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:02,239
cloud platform and cloud service right

2647
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,000
you know that uh

2648
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,239
graphic center hosts a vm or vpcs for

2649
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:09,679
customers right

2650
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:11,760
so

2651
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,920
my question is

2652
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,480
your definition activation only is based

2653
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,119
on the assumption that the vpc will be

2654
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:21,599
applicable only or do stack

2655
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:25,520
if if the vpc can reduce that how to uh

2656
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,599
support the dual stack of vpc in

2657
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:30,960
applications only a cloud uh

2658
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,880
large softbox

2659
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,400
okay

2660
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,280
okay uh

2661
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,119
the

2662
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:42,480
the vps is runs on the overlay right

2663
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,199
it's not required it's not a

2664
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:47,599
must to require that we

2665
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,679
with full capability to support that

2666
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:53,199
overlay uh so

2667
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:58,320
in in is it's just to provide a tunnel

2668
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,159
technologies

2669
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:05,199
uh so that the vpc can run your stack

2670
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:08,880
and the idc can run ip6 only

2671
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,800
but right now it's not achieved that

2672
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,960
that basis

2673
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,800
right now the all traffic are run on the

2674
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,360
ipv4 as a turtle

2675
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,880
so

2676
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,679
that's the that's the field that we need

2677
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,320
to face field

2678
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,840
okay thank you

2679
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,400
hello uh i have a little bit similar

2680
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,719
question to the previous one but um if

2681
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:36,639
in the future you will have ipv6 only

2682
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:39,119
application then uh probably you will

2683
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:41,280
still have some somewhere small number

2684
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,360
of users which are ipd4 uh users and in

2685
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,800
this case you will need some network

2686
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,800
address translation here on your slides

2687
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,840
i have seen netflix translation from six

2688
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,560
to four but i i have not six

2689
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,760
have not seen the plan in opposite

2690
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,560
direction from four to six uh because in

2691
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,480
the future definitely you will have a

2692
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,320
small number of users which would be

2693
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:05,679
ipv4 only and you will have ipv6 only

2694
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:07,920
applications do you have a plan for load

2695
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,840
balancer or network translation or

2696
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:14,159
something to translate from four to six

2697
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:18,880
well

2698
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,159
it seems like

2699
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:23,520
time is up so

2700
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,320
our session

2701
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,119
actually just one quick note

2702
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:30,000
um

2703
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,080
even though fred isn't leaving us now i

2704
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,920
wanted to quickly take a second to thank

2705
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,440
him for you know

2706
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:38,239
17 years of service and having served as

2707
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:40,800
a really great basic soft chair

2708
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,840
um as fred said this isn't goodbye yet

2709
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,599
but he does indicate that he's you know

2710
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:48,080
potentially interested in leaving

2711
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,239
whether or not we'll let him actually

2712
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:52,639
leave it's a separate question

2713
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:53,520
um

2714
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,440
but you know i'd like friends to say

2715
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,440
thanks to fred um drop him an email

2716
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,330
thanking him

2717
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:04,800
[Applause]

2718
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,280
