1
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
actually

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
all right welcome everybody this is the

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,400
secure asset transfer protocol uh we may

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
have a short discussion we may have a

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
long one so i'm going to get started

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,760
assuming we might have a long one

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
i'm wes hartaker for those that don't

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
know me and uh there's a mailing list

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
for this there is a little bit of

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
discrepancy in terms of what this group

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
is called it was originally called sat

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,079
and the mailing list is called sap but

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
the both is called sat p with the p for

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,680
protocol so

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,440
uh don't let that confuse you some of

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
the slides might say one thing and other

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
slides might say another thing it's

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
still the same thing

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
and this is romantic one of the seconds

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
to explain why we had to do that there

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
there were some data tracker things that

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
we wanted to have slightly longer names

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
than three-letter acronyms

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,119
so

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,640
it's all good

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
uh this is the agenda for today we'll

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
start off i'll rant for a little bit

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
about stuff um

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
then we're gonna have the brunt of the

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
material which will be both uh problem

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
statements and assumptions um some use

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
cases on how this is expected to be used

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
as well as a protocol overview for where

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
the work might start from uh with an

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
initial uh draft that

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
need to be later adopted by the working

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
group should it go forward

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
uh we'll have an open discussion after

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,119
that and where people can bring other

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,040
stuff note that the

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,079
uh

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
the three sections of questions

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,520
following those other presentations are

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,040
really just clarifying questions we're

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,320
not going to get into the brunt of is

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,159
this a good idea or does this belong in

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
the ietf until later we need to get

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
through those three presentations and

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
understand the background first

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,880
and the chartered discussion should

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
shake say 20 minutes i thought i'd

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
change that apparently i didn't uh we do

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
have a draft charter it's on the mailing

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
list and there's some on the slides

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,280
and then of course we'll have the

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
standard ending of above

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
is this a good idea and should the work

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
proceed in the ietf

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
i'm sure most of you have at least seen

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
the note well i don't know how many of

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
you have read the note well but

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
basically there's some legal

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,840
ramifications of participating in the

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
ietf specifically around patents i'm not

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
a lawyer so i won't dive into it too

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
much

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
we have

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
a bunch of documents that talk about

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
this that and that talk about everything

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
from how the standards process works to

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
how working groups work to

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,879
anti-harassment procedures and code of

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
conduct and copyright and patents and

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
stuff everybody needs to be aware of

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
that especially if you're representing

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
your your company

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
our code of conduct guidelines um

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
especially this you know really holds

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
true for boss things can get heated and

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
above if differing opinions you know

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
kind of come around so remember to treat

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
everybody with respect

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
speak slowly like i am not doing

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
uh limit the use of slang you know use

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
use english that most people will

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,640
understand um dispute ideas using region

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
reasoned argument in other words don't

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
say that that's a horrible idea explain

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,640
why you think it's a horrible idea

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
uh use your best engineering judgment

91
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,159
and then find the best solution that

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
works for the whole internet the the

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
ietf is designed to work for the whole

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
internet not just a segment of the

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
internet

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,959
and contribute to the ongoing work note

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
that the ietf has a masking policy for

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
for this ietf everybody should be

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
wearing a mask unless you are taking a

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,319
sip uh no taking one hour long drinks

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,640
that does not count

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
i've seen people do that

103
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
um so you know they're the the cases

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
really have been rising uh some of the

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
iuts staff are sick uh it's actually not

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
good so please everybody keep your masks

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
up uh russ you're actually gonna stay in

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,480
the policy there's no exception for

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
eating and drinking in these rooms

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,280
thank you and dan that means you

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
i'm serious

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
put your mask on

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
you're doing this all week

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,560
all right so if you're in question go

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
read the policy on the website that's

116
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
actually the authoritative source

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,920
not me or echo for that matter the

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
wording on the website's correct and

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
eckerd's probably quoting it correctly

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
because he always does

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
um

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
the uh ietf tool so if you want to speak

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,238
in the room please do use the qr code

124
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
over there to log in you need to log in

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
with the data tracker and we will be

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
using only people at the queue so lining

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
for the mic won't do do well you need to

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,479
make sure you use the queue by clicking

129
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
on the little button in the agenda or

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
you can scan the qr code either one of

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
those will work

132
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
we will be doing q order because we have

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560
a lot of remote people too

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
uh

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
in general

136
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
boss have a particular goal right

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
we need to decide

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
does this problem need solving is the

139
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
ietf the right place for it are there

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
enough people interested in doing the

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
work is the scope well designed is it

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
too big is it too small

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
are the deliverables right do we think

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
that this is you know this is what

145
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,759
should come out of the working group you

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
know for it to succeed and if we do put

147
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
all those other things together will it

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
actually succeed we think that there's a

149
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
good chance of success and this is all

150
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,759
documented in rfc 5434 which is a great

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
document for

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
bots in general

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
but really about getting work started

154
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
so back to the agenda uh this is the

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
agenda and we are going to go on to

156
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
thomas with the problem statements and

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
assumptions

158
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
can everybody hear me okay do i need to

159
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
you need to get pretty close hello okay

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
and it should be it said a new one was

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
openings

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
it takes a second okay

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,440
maybe i need to unshare first

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
okay just give us a second folks

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,520
okay i'm just gonna wait until that

166
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,160
thing yeah i'm granting it but it's not

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
otherwise you could just move the slides

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
forward

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,400
let me try it

170
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,919
let's actually revoke you now try it

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
that it shouldn't take that long

172
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
let me try it from my side instead yeah

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
maybe just yeah it's probably easy if

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
you drive it

175
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,000
yeah that worked

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you can still request access if you want

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
sure uh so i'm going to talk about um

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
that's the problem definition and the

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,919
assumptions that we're going into this

180
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
um

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
okay so so

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
this slide and the next slide next slide

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
is diagram is terminology so

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,039
this is particularly important because

185
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
we want to keep the discussion sort of

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
generic so i'm using the word network

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,400
as a group of nodes that share state

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
about a digital asset and you're going

189
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
to turn around and say what's the

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
digital asset that's the second one

191
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,280
and why is it important because there's

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
this notion of

193
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
validity

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
just take the mic out

195
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,360
okay

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
okay that's better so okay

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
is this is this sounding better for

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
focus yeah okay

199
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,479
okay i won't sing so but i'll just speak

200
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,440
i promise um so validity means that the

201
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,240
data object is legally recognized and

202
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
the word legal is you can talk about

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
that later

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,080
which means it has some economic value

205
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,199
that's been

206
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
you know legally recognized with inside

207
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
jurisdiction to have them

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
gateway is a computer

209
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
that's authorized to act on behalf of

210
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
network and asset transfer is the

211
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
protocol to move the

212
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
asset from one network to the other so

213
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
this is the general picture

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
that refers

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
that you know we talked about in the

216
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,920
previous slide

217
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
okay so moving forward so problem

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
statement what we want is an interrupt

219
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,519
protocol that permits the movements of a

220
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
digital asset from one network to the

221
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
other

222
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
and we have some conditions and that is

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,959
that we have to do this while retaining

224
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
the validity of the digital asset

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,000
and it has to be done in such a way that

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
when the there's a third party

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
independent

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
that is asked to verify post transfer of

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,959
course that they can do that there's

230
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
sufficient evidence for somebody to come

231
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
in to say yes this is true this is not

232
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
true because

233
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
there's always you know system failures

234
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
and so there's always um cases where

235
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,120
disputes occur so that's that's kind of

236
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
uh the condition

237
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
at least one condition

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
so assumptions so we assume that both

239
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,399
networks please share common semantics

240
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
about what the data object is and the

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
notion of validity

242
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
so

243
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
and this notion of ability is going to

244
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
come come up again

245
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
it really depends on the legal legal

246
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,560
jurisdiction of where that you know

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
network operates

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
we assume one or both networks are

249
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
opaque meaning that

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
we assume that you can't see into the

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
resources into the constructs in the

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
network so i'm i'm using the analogy of

253
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,959
routing where you have an isp

254
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
network and you know nicely is not going

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,959
to let you look into all the subnets

256
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
within the asp network it's the same

257
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
same concept this is the autonomous

258
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
systems principle concept

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
the gateways are trusted so we can we

260
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
can talk about that later but it's

261
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
trusted to do this one thing

262
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
and and only that thing

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,839
information subsets are what we call

264
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,680
views maybe share so views are not asset

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
transfer views it's just an extract of

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
information that's queried to a gateway

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
so you could say hey gateway i know

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,279
you've got

269
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
you know behind you there's this type of

270
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,839
network

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,240
i want to ask you about this particular

272
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
state of an object in that network and

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
the gateway is going to respond you know

274
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
digitally signed and so on and so on

275
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
right so so it's not an it's not a

276
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,360
transfer the key thing is that it's just

277
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
information

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
so what we want to do this is use the

279
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
gateway model because you know we've got

280
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,440
a lot a lot of lessons learned from the

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,959
history of the internet

282
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
um you know many many people don't

283
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
realize the the internet is not one long

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
contiguous network there's lots of

285
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
networks in between there's backbone

286
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
networks

287
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,839
and in in many cases you know the the

288
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
interconnection point between two

289
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,320
networks

290
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
are in fact implemented by some gateway

291
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
you know gateway function so we assume

292
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
there's one or more gateways

293
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
in front of each network of course

294
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
a gateway need to needs to peer with

295
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
another gateway to actually run the

296
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
secure asset transfer protocol

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
and we assume the gateway hides the

298
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
complexity or the

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
uniqueness of the network

300
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
behind it and that's consistent with the

301
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,519
opiq

302
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,640
networks principle

303
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,160
and so

304
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
our proposed area of work in the itf is

305
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,519
the

306
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
yellow it looks green on the screen here

307
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
but it's it's the yellow bit the in the

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,320
middle right so

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
uh it's between gateway and g1 and g2

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
uh we don't care or we it's out of scope

311
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,720
for us you know to uh

312
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,959
how the network is is defined what is

313
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
the network and so on and so on and if

314
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
we do the gateway protocol correctly

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
it's possible that one of the networks

316
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
or both of them could in fact be

317
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,360
monolithic systems right so think about

318
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
you know existing you know

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,279
i don't say

320
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
banking systems rtgs you know clearing

321
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
systems that some of you might be

322
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,320
aware of

323
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
it could be one of them could be both of

324
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,160
them right so so we almost like don't

325
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
care it's just you know our focus is

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
between g1 and g2

327
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
and how g1 deals with network and w1

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
how g2 deals with network 2 is autoscope

329
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
so it's if you are implementing a

330
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,200
gateway

331
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
it's your job to figure out how it's

332
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
going to you know you need an adapter a

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
connector whatever with the network

334
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,359
behind you

335
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
and

336
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
why why why is this because this is too

337
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
many networks there's too many network

338
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,440
types

339
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,959
so it's it's just you know it's just too

340
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,200
much work

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
um so we want to look at um three

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,800
particular modes we just followed modes

343
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,360
first one is you know asset transfer

344
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
the second one is this data sharing so

345
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
you know there's a gateway there's an

346
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,680
api

347
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
if you're authorized to ask a question

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,839
you go to that api

349
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,360
and it's not an asset transfer you're

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
just extracting information

351
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
the third one which is down the road

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
somewhere sometimes it's going to be

353
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,399
what we call asset exchange or asset

354
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,920
swap which is a coordinated swap that's

355
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
you know occurring through the two

356
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,519
gateways

357
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
the scope of work api endpoint

358
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,199
definitions resource identifiers

359
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
the message payloads uh the message

360
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
format the message flows so for the

361
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
floats we are looking at a the classic

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
three pc three phase commit this is

363
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
classic database textbook if you're in

364
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
college this is database one or database

365
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
two

366
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
of course um you know

367
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,720
for those for those people who don't

368
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
know what the 2pcsvpc is

369
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
and there's there's acid properties

370
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
there's also classic properties just

371
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
google it you you'll find what acid

372
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
stands for and of course we we care very

373
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,120
much about the security and the

374
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,440
liveliness protocol of properties

375
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639
of the of the product

376
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
okay so

377
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
current main technical graphs we have an

378
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
architecture drive we have a we have a

379
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
protocol draft and we actually have a

380
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,760
use cases draft that's not yet uploaded

381
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,240
but you know it's it's uh we have

382
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
material for use cases and in fact we

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
are looking for people to provide us

384
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,079
with use cases that

385
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,440
you know that would be you know be

386
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
useful for the uh for the discussion

387
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
is that my last slide i think that's my

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,079
last slide

389
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
okay so with that i will take a clear

390
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,600
clarifying questions as i mentioned

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,120
coming up next

392
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,839
is uh some discussion about use cases on

393
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,199
where this is envisioned and then

394
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,199
followed by that as an early protocol

395
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,800
description so if your questions about

396
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,880
those do table them until later dave

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
please dave taylor and uh i could have

398
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,040
saved my question for the next

399
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
presentation but i looked at the slides

400
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
and the question is actually more

401
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
appropriate on the slides on this one so

402
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,160
if you don't mind if you can go back to

403
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
the terminology slide so i can ask my

404
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
clarifying question

405
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
um

406
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
while you're doing that um let me prefix

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
it with a question i think is answered

408
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
so you can see where i'm coming from on

409
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,800
my clarifying question um it has to do

410
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
with which types of assets are in scope

411
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
here right there's three types of assets

412
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,959
you might think pure pure digital

413
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
things that have no reality in the real

414
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
world there are things that are pure

415
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
physical and there are things that are

416
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,519
hybrid and hybrid i mean things like the

417
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
keys to the physical device right the

418
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
digital keys for there and i'm

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
interpreting digital asset as being

420
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,839
those two categories but not the pure

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
physical one but it could be the digital

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
asset that is the proof of possession or

423
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
proof of ownership of something okay so

424
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,079
that would then lead to my actual

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
terrifying question okay

426
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
because if i look at asset transfer here

427
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,959
there are two types of asset transfer

428
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
uh voluntary and involuntary elliott

429
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,040
leader gave a great presentation i think

430
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
it was

431
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
in one of the iot meetings i think at

432
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
last ietf about involuntary ownership

433
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
transfer which more typically shows up

434
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
in the hybrid case but can show up in

435
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,959
the pure digital as well and we're

436
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
talking about lawful repossession lawful

437
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
confiscation lawful foreclosure things

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
like that okay

439
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,199
so my question is are those in scope

440
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,320
because according to this slide the

441
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
answer would be yes if you go forward a

442
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,120
slide

443
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
the answer is uh where you talk about

444
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
you know the the notion of a gateway or

445
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
whatever um tends to imply that the

446
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,880
answer is no but maybe that's because

447
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,320
you're jumping into solution here but

448
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
this is the problem statement thing so

449
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,120
my question is is involuntary

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,480
asset transfer of digital assets is that

451
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
part of the architecture or not part of

452
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,839
the architecture this is the problem

453
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,959
statement i'm asking which problem

454
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,720
you're trying to solve so to because the

455
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
first question is the type of asset yes

456
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
the the digital or hybrid

457
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,839
it's out of scope for us right now

458
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,240
because we assume that the applications

459
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
the the two sides

460
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
know what they talk they talk about the

461
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
same asset and so we've had discussions

462
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,919
about how do you identify an asset there

463
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
is in fact industry efforts to provide

464
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,039
numbers there's an itin number

465
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
for digital assets is being developed so

466
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
gateway g1 needs to tell gateway d2 it's

467
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,039
this one

468
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
it's this asset g2 will then look up

469
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
okay this is yes it's valid it's legally

470
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
recognized in the uk great but yeah

471
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,679
guess what my network can't accept yeah

472
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,280
i liked your statement about legally

473
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
recognized and that's exactly what

474
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,559
that's my question right legal

475
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,039
recognition entails involuntary as well

476
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
so the second question voluntary

477
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
involuntary that's to me right now it's

478
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
out of scope the gateway is responding

479
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
to a call to do something and it's and

480
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
the caller has authorization so it's

481
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
gonna do it

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
okay this is the problem statement

483
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
presentation gateways are part of the

484
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
solution if the problem you're trying to

485
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
solve is also to do involuntary then

486
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
that dictates whether and how you use

487
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
gateways right i'm trying to not use the

488
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
word gateway in my question because i

489
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
don't consider that to be a problem

490
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
statement i consider that to be a

491
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
solution to a problem right the problem

492
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,280
is do you want to do involuntary digital

493
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,400
asset transfer

494
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
or not and it sounds like your answer is

495
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
you do not okay all of that may be a

496
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
question for the scope of the bathroom

497
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
to get started it's a scope because we i

498
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,240
mean right now we haven't actually

499
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
talked about that right we just said

500
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
okay is this going to happen between g1

501
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
and g2 it is a good scope question folks

502
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,480
so please

503
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
thank you dude

504
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
yeah so i'm trying to also understand

505
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,120
apparently abstract so

506
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
should i be thinking nfts in this

507
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
conversation

508
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
is that an asset is that is that a

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
legally does the sec recognize that as

510
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
an asset who knows who knows this is why

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,799
should i visiting bitcoins so is it is

512
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
it is it an asset so i'm getting i'm

513
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,760
getting somewhere but i'm trying to have

514
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
a reference point so use cases is coming

515
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
up next i'll remind you

516
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
but okay i do understand that

517
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
okay so

518
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
use the word verified means or trusted

519
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
and understand is interact

520
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,000
so what i mean by that is that

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,799
um

522
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
in many networks and many networks of

523
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,760
heights will use bitcoins or nfts

524
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
they're constructed in a way that

525
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
they're they're not supposed to be

526
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
non-trusted which is to say that

527
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,840
there's no entity which can

528
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
involuntarily transfer your asset from

529
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
one dollar right

530
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
and so my question is

531
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
when

532
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,799
is the gateway in this case

533
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,240
able to

534
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
is is the gateway's transfer of this

535
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
asset

536
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,440
verifiable in the way that the ordinary

537
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
asset transfers are verifiable inside

538
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
the network or not

539
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
so so

540
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
so the gateway

541
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
uh is trusted and the gateway just obeys

542
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
the command so i don't know what trusted

543
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
means trust is not like well it's his

544
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,240
assumption

545
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
is it universally interested

546
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
it's it's trusted by the participants in

547
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
the network okay so let me just let me

548
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
understand this correctly that forget

549
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
about forget about like uh destination

550
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,559
network two

551
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
i have an asset a network one

552
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,159
you're saying that the gateway can

553
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
transfer my assets to dave

554
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,679
without my cooperation that is that is a

555
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
recession i am not saying that this is

556
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
we're pushing that no i mean this is a

557
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
very core there's a very core

558
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
requirement so like either

559
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,679
either plays by the rules of these

560
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
networks we should not allow those

561
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,799
things or does not play by the reals

562
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,000
these networks which doesn't do a lot of

563
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,159
those things which one is it so so it's

564
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,880
not which one it depends on the network

565
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
is it is it a private

566
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,840
closed network belonging to banks

567
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
is it is it let's assume is the bitcoin

568
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,480
blockchain ethereum blockchain

569
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
i don't know

570
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
this is like a core consumer question so

571
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
so let me propose

572
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,520
yes

573
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
let me propose something for for this

574
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
box today right that that because the

575
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
involuntary voluntary scope is going to

576
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,760
become a problem

577
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
and so i think that today we should we

578
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
should concentrate on a voluntary

579
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,200
transfer

580
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,679
where two networks that trust each other

581
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,280
and i know

582
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,000
right

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
but networks don't trust networks

584
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
have that without property so that's not

585
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,039
a property two

586
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,840
two different um banks using swift right

587
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
have some level of trust when they're

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
talking to each other from what i

589
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,159
understand this is very similar right

590
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
one gateway has trust that another one

591
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
is going to act in a um

592
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
they have an agreement in place maybe

593
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,039
it's backed by legal that's out of scope

594
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
how to define that trust is out of scope

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
so

596
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,280
my you know and i'm not a proponent but

597
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
my vision of when they started this is

598
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
that we start with a small building

599
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
block and the expansion into how do you

600
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
define what each network looks like and

601
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,039
how do you define what all that is you

602
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,799
get the protocol between the gateways

603
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,120
first but that that doesn't work because

604
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
because because the structure of these

605
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
systems requires that the protocol

606
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,919
embody those those other transition

607
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,520
requirements is part of it that's what

608
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
i'm saying it's like if you have systems

609
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
systems which are like zero trust

610
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
systems which the system with some

611
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
systems in the large list are not then

612
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,080
the asset transfers have to embody

613
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,960
the as

614
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
this protocol is asset transfer the

615
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
whole thing falls apart if you look at

616
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
like side chains on like you know

617
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
side chains and bitcoin right they

618
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,159
embody them by the president's

619
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
and so so we're not doing bitcoin just

620
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
just let our audience understand okay so

621
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
we're not doing bitcoin okay this is our

622
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,480
scope you can go oh bitcoins okay right

623
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,559
so our blockchains and javascript yes

624
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,520
and then

625
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
volunteer that's why we're calling it

626
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
network

627
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,000
so the definition of what is

628
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
what is a digital asset or what is

629
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,919
transferable is that a scope right so

630
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,559
we're not talking about any particular

631
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,760
form

632
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,280
it doesn't say that it couldn't be used

633
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
for bitcoin or it couldn't be used to

634
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,799
transfer my the thing that came up in

635
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
iab open just a bit ago right was i have

636
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,520
a movie that i bought with with one

637
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
vendor i want to digitally transfer my

638
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,120
movie to a friend right give it to them

639
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,200
sell it maybe to a completely different

640
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
vendor but now you know those two

641
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,799
parties say amazon and google need to

642
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
make positive assurance that when i

643
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
transfer it i no longer have access to

644
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,600
it

645
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
oh okay well i guess i'll sit down until

646
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
some discussion but like this is like so

647
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
this is so exact i can't understand it

648
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,520
fair enough so i think at the open mic

649
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,240
is when we'll come back to

650
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,159
the bigger question of is this tractable

651
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,200
or not

652
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
colin

653
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,000
okay so

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,520
my question is slightly related to these

655
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,640
ones but i don't think it quite got

656
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
answer i think it might be easier and

657
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,159
fitting to think can you can you just

658
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
define a little bit more when you say

659
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
trusted what you mean by trusted and i

660
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
don't care about the gateways trusting

661
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
each other i don't care about the other

662
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,000
gateway the the other network what does

663
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
it mean on this diagram that network one

664
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,960
trusts gateway one like what what do you

665
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
mean by that part of word trust in that

666
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
context so the participants in network

667
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,559
one

668
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,000
agree that they authorized u1 to do some

669
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,159
that really helps me resolve the problem

670
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,240
statement is g1 is trusted by network by

671
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
every member of network one to do any

672
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,360
transfer of any asset in network one

673
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,559
right that's sort of what we mean by

674
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,640
trusted here okay

675
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,640
voluntary

676
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
so

677
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
um what would voluntary even mean i mean

678
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
it seems that the definition you

679
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
provided trusted which i think is fine

680
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
for the context of this it

681
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
removes all possibility of even knowing

682
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
whether it's voluntary or involuntary

683
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
like g1 just does it and that's pretty

684
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
much what you said before right it takes

685
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,039
the command

686
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,760
so the originator in network one has to

687
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,120
authorize g1 to do the transfer

688
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,039
if something has to trigger it gmail is

689
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,960
not going to just randomly pick up

690
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
somebody's ass at it and move it across

691
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,799
somebody has to you know tell you what

692
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,400
i mean but that's that's different than

693
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
what you just told me you said that g1

694
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
yeah so g1 probably wouldn't do

695
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,080
something unless somebody triggered it

696
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,559
but if g1 wanted to just do something

697
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,320
with no trigger like it's trusted to do

698
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,279
it it is trusted to make any transition

699
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
by the definition of trusted you know

700
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,559
later on because this is not a

701
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,559
discussion of trust or trustlessness or

702
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
so on

703
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
maybe but i think your whole problem

704
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
statement is about trust and what trust

705
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,600
means of who's allowed to make these

706
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
transactions to move something from

707
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
point a to point b it's about trust

708
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
uh reverend wilton alicia you're not in

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,840
actually you didn't click the button to

710
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,279
get my phone i'll let you can you go

711
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,000
after philip and i'll let you in

712
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
uh wilson cisco so i just want to

713
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,039
question and clarify about what allowed

714
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
failure modes are here so is it

715
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,240
acceptable for this transaction to fail

716
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,320
and require like human intervention

717
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
sorted out

718
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,799
so the question is about the failure

719
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
yeah so we anticipate

720
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
there's several points in the in the

721
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
three pc that could fail

722
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
and fail that means say that one of the

723
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,400
gateways dies

724
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
okay or somebody actually something goes

725
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
wrong and and one of them either dies or

726
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
refuses to move forward on the flow

727
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,520
and the supports okay and when you say

728
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,240
bought does it mean do you expect the

729
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,200
asset to to remain in the first network

730
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,039
or is it that it could end up being

731
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
assets in night the network so that's

732
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,640
what they're trying to avoid that

733
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,120
that the acid properties if we follow it

734
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,400
properly

735
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,320
it guarantees that it's in one of the

736
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
networks not both or it's not lost

737
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
because we don't want lost it guarantees

738
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,039
under some circumstances like unbounded

739
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,559
network delay and things like that okay

740
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,400
so that's kind of that's why we put acid

741
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
dislike that's classic database you know

742
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
transactions

743
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,000
you know that you have to have the state

744
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
in when you move a copy of the data it

745
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,960
has to arrive on in all nodes or not no

746
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
anyway because we can bring the whole

747
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
asset thing offline yeah and it's like

748
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
when you transfer money between

749
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,720
countries and things it's possible the

750
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,360
money goes from a to b or just gets lost

751
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,799
and you have to then phone people up and

752
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,960
say where's my money so it's not like

753
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
it's guaranteed to either be in your

754
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,679
source account or the destination

755
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,200
account you can end up failing we're

756
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
trying to minimize the window of that

757
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
occurring so my question is can it fail

758
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,880
at all so is it like that's not allowed

759
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
you're never allowed to fail although

760
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,320
some successes where it might fail

761
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
and it's a problem you know

762
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
circumstances that you can fail i'd just

763
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
be quite honest there's no 100

764
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
bulletproof

765
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,279
you know okay so let's escape

766
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,039
roman

767
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,640
hi roman de niro carnegie mellon

768
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,559
university uh just to clarify what i

769
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,919
think is a simple question from a

770
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,880
perspective of sat when we say asset

771
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
it's just a blob it's just a block it's

772
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
just what we call data object okay so

773
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
opaque

774
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
okay thanks

775
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
dave

776
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,279
dave flavor

777
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,480
you use the term legally recognized

778
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
my clear my clarifying question is do

779
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,640
you assume that everything in this

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
diagram you know both sides of the

781
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
transaction

782
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,279
have the same definition of legally

783
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,520
recognized absolutely not

784
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,559
absolutely

785
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,279
this is the problem that that in phase

786
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,720
okay because it's just another way of

787
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
phrasing the tone of questions that

788
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
ecker and i were both asking right

789
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,679
because trusted by one side doesn't mean

790
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
trusted by the other side if you say

791
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
that they have different definitions of

792
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,039
legally recognized trusted to behave you

793
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,440
know probably per our product

794
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
so if you explicitly say make sure the

795
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,360
answer is you explicitly want to cover

796
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,039
cases where there are different

797
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,760
definitions of legal so in that case

798
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
they may not have agreement of course

799
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
and who owns it so so i think that's a

800
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,919
very hard problem and you might want to

801
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,120
uh back off on that and and say legally

802
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
recognized across the entire set of

803
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,559
things where i think that one might be

804
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,159
tractable

805
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,240
phillip phil

806
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,440
yeah

807
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
going back to the involuntary transfers

808
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
thing

809
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,360
the ability to support an involuntary

810
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
transfer

811
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,600
is a property of networks

812
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
so if you've got an origin network this

813
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
is tracking an asset

814
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
that isn't capable of doing an

815
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
involuntary transfer

816
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
then bolting this stuff on isn't going

817
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,200
to give you that capability and there's

818
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
no way that our spec here

819
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
can

820
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
provide a way to do that involuntary

821
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,760
transfer

822
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
so

823
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
i don't think that that's a problem

824
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
for us

825
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,399
regulatory wise i think that anything

826
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,919
that doesn't support involuntary

827
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,159
transport is probably going to get

828
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,559
banned

829
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,679
and should be

830
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
alicia did you want to say something i

831
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,960
told you

832
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,120
there

833
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,840
she's still around oh yep okay

834
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,039
my apology i didn't follow the product

835
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,080
of my

836
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,159
my phone doesn't work but uh

837
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,240
i think

838
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,559
i agree the definition like uh

839
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
rigorousness but i think we should let

840
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
them uh present their case rather than

841
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,039
beating them down

842
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,799
my understanding good stuff this is good

843
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,399
stuff but i appreciate it very much my

844
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
understanding is that the two gateways

845
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,120
actually authenticated each other let's

846
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
not use the bigger words if the smaller

847
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,000
one can work they authenticate it and

848
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,320
they agreed to transfer this block

849
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,440
that's it and let's not dive deeper than

850
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
that

851
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,159
thank you

852
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,000
sorry big words okay okay

853
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
can you return control of the

854
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,440
i'm sure there we go

855
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,439
can everybody hear me

856
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
right

857
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,640
uh

858
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,240
so yeah let me make a presentation i

859
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,519
imagine we'll have some questions

860
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,440
from the same lines that uh thomas face

861
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
so i'll try to address them later okay

862
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
next ip

863
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
yeah can you hear me now yeah all right

864
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
very good

865
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
okay so uh

866
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,799
i work for ibm research and uh

867
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,159
i'm going to try and motivate some use

868
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,240
cases for you which are the kinds of

869
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
cases we have been encountering for the

870
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
past few years so

871
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
in ibm research and ibm in general we've

872
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
been building uh over the past few years

873
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,399
a lot of solutions around the

874
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,760
business networks especially in the

875
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,919
supply chain area so

876
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,480
uh what you see here is again uh the

877
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
first bullet point promise of open

878
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
network monitoring them all just

879
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,159
it's just an allusion to

880
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
ethereum you can you can think of one

881
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,960
big system that aim to

882
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,720
manage all possible digital assets and

883
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
all possible workflows in the world we

884
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
think that's not going to be possible

885
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,600
you have different kinds of technologies

886
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,360
built on different kinds of principles

887
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
either centralized decentralized you can

888
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,360
build networks on the uh

889
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,760
in different ways and those networks can

890
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,480
do

891
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,799
uh can solve different purposes

892
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,880
like for example you see here there are

893
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,799
networks that we have built that handle

894
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
trade logistics for example so one

895
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,399
example i give you is a trade length

896
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
it's a system that ibm built with uh

897
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,399
mask and involved other uh exporters and

898
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,120
shipping carriers uh and connected all

899
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
of them to manage mainly uh shipping

900
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,760
uh logistics that is all the

901
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,679
documentation involving the export of

902
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,760
goods from one country to another

903
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
passing through a carrier and making

904
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
sure that all regulations are followed

905
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
there's uh uh there are networks we

906
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,640
built for

907
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
trade finance that is uh if you all know

908
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
about the

909
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,120
counterparty risk in the export import

910
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
problem uh

911
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,159
refinance is the way to uh

912
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,120
to mitigate that problem that is uh

913
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,039
does the exporters transfer the goods

914
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,200
first or the does the importer pay for

915
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,720
the goods first because

916
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
whichever side links first i mean uh the

917
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,120
other side stands at risk right so uh

918
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,880
trade finance uh

919
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
has uh

920
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
over the past few centuries people have

921
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,880
come up with solutions such as the

922
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
letters of credit to make sure that

923
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
exporters importers

924
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,080
are can safely conduct trades uh without

925
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
losing out in the process and that

926
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,519
involves banks so we have built some

927
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,880
networks from that

928
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
we build networks uh we built

929
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,480
demonstrations on uh how to

930
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,799
uh share kyc information across

931
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,399
different banks who are part of a single

932
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,559
network and then you can also have a

933
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
networks built to

934
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,240
track the provenance of food like

935
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
there's a network alive in food trust so

936
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
uh all of these uh networks they

937
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,519
were built according to philosophy which

938
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,120
involved the

939
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
minimum scope so

940
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,039
the various enterprises that already had

941
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,440
processes to run these different things

942
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
like trade finance or logistics or

943
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,399
provenance they did not want to rush

944
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,200
headlong into building big networks

945
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,559
solving all of their

946
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,840
all of the activities that their

947
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,679
organizations did so you ended up

948
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,120
building networks just for trade

949
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,520
logistics just to trade finance just to

950
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,000
track uh provenance of uh supply chain

951
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
of goods and supply chain and so on uh

952
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
so that's what called minimum ecosystems

953
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
so

954
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,918
that's the reality uh you have these

955
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,280
different kinds of networks that are

956
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,918
that are there and they might also be

957
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,079
built on different kinds of platforms

958
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
underneath uh

959
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,440
built on either and they can be either

960
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,040
centralized decentralized or what have

961
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,639
you so

962
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,520
uh

963
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,839
the what we end up with are a lot of

964
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,159
these different networks and by the way

965
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
these networks many of them can be

966
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,800
either open access or they can also be

967
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
permissioned that is they have a

968
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,000
gatekeeper

969
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
usually it's a consortium which guards

970
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,679
who can join the network and who's privy

971
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,079
to the information within it so

972
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
you have these processes and you have

973
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,199
the assets that we possibly manage

974
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,040
within these respective networks

975
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
what uh kind of fragmentation are we

976
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
talking about here so there's

977
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
a

978
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,320
horizontal fragmentation for example you

979
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,480
can have a trade finance networks i'll

980
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
give you two examples there's a network

981
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,839
called bitrate there's a network called

982
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,960
marco polo beat it was built on a

983
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
platform called hyperledger fabric

984
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,480
markov is built on platform for corda

985
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,560
and they both are trying to solve the

986
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
same problem that they're bringing

987
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,359
together banks and

988
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,200
exporters and importers and managing

989
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,160
trade finance but they have uh different

990
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
types of banks different frontal now

991
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,640
what happens if you have uh you want to

992
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,520
let's say

993
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
move from one network to the other you

994
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,680
have to make sure that uh the letter

995
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
credit rate in one network is

996
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,920
understandable or it can be moved to a

997
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
different network

998
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
it's not only possible in this

999
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,240
fragmented world so the horizontal

1000
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
fragmentation is different network

1001
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,800
solving similar purposes but handling a

1002
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
different clientele so because people

1003
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
want to have flexibility in terms of

1004
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
what networks the affiliate affiliate

1005
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
with you need to be able to bridge that

1006
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,920
gap vertical fragmentation is about a

1007
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,599
network like trade lens managing trade

1008
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,320
logistics and your network like bitrate

1009
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,040
managing uh trade finance

1010
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,680
these both of these processes are not

1011
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
independent in the real world you have

1012
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,839
read finance drive straight logistics

1013
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,760
trade logistics right right finance and

1014
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
i'll come to that in a second uh but but

1015
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,400
uh you have these networks built on they

1016
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
can be built on this same kind of

1017
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,119
platform the trade lengths and meat

1018
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,240
trade are both built on hypoglycemic so

1019
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,000
these networks need to connect with each

1020
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
other in order to be able to securely

1021
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,079
transfer assets or communicate asset

1022
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,160
states between each other

1023
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,119
that's that's another kind of

1024
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,800
fragmentation so let me come to a

1025
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,839
concrete example to the next

1026
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,560
slide

1027
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
okay just uh compartmentalize your

1028
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,200
vision to the middle part

1029
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
i call these seller and buyer but you

1030
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
can think of them as the exporter and

1031
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
importer as well so let's say an export

1032
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,400
and importer agree on a trade

1033
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
and they come up with a purchase order

1034
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,280
let's say they have a

1035
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
common reference uh referring to that

1036
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
particular trade instance

1037
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
and if you look at the network on the

1038
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,440
left that's managing trade finance okay

1039
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,880
so it's bringing together

1040
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
uh your seller your buyer and their

1041
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
respective banks and it is running a

1042
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,760
process of a letter of credit what

1043
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,520
happens there a buyer requests for

1044
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
letter credit from its bank

1045
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,440
its bank proposes one the seller's bank

1046
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,920
then approves it and the seller is then

1047
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
later supposed to provide evidence that

1048
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
it should be good and that creates an

1049
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,920
obligation in the network in the network

1050
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
system of record and the buyer is

1051
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
supposed to pay it back so that's really

1052
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
the workflow that is being

1053
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,960
run by these different parties in a

1054
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,040
typically in a decentralized manner uh

1055
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,839
and the answers is managing our letters

1056
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,680
of credit that's that's really what you

1057
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,960
have on the books uh and uh we will need

1058
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,640
that letter credit to be somewhat

1059
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,119
removable we cannot afford to have it

1060
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,040
just be siloed in this network as we've

1061
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
seen the next slide uh the network on

1062
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,920
the right is managing trade logistics

1063
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
what that uh again these are very

1064
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,520
simplified forms of what such networks

1065
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
do in the real world okay uh so the

1066
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
network on the right it's bringing

1067
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,440
together sellers and carriers seller is

1068
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,599
trying to uh

1069
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,839
booking consignment on the network

1070
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
dispatching via carrier and the carrier

1071
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
is then uploading uh this document

1072
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,839
called bill of plating which is proof

1073
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,520
that the seller shipped the goods and

1074
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,760
usually in the state financing world

1075
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,800
bills of lading are provided as evidence

1076
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
that let us credit that the seller's

1077
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,320
part is fulfilled that is the exporter

1078
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
exported the goods so now the importer

1079
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,280
is supposed to make a payment so you

1080
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,119
have bills of rating being maintained in

1081
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,040
the record on the state logistics

1082
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
network on the right so where does the

1083
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,800
secure asset transfer come in you move

1084
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
to the next slide

1085
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
a lot of slides left so you might want

1086
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
to you have a lot of slides left so you

1087
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
might want to start yeah

1088
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
okay so what you see here

1089
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,760
is sort of a join of the two networks

1090
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
you saw on the previous slide state

1091
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,640
finance network on the left trade

1092
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,800
logistics on the right and

1093
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
there is a

1094
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,440
there's an inherent interdependency

1095
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,599
between these two processes you can see

1096
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
let me go first go to the

1097
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
uh extra step that was added at the top

1098
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
optimal plating so there's a bill of

1099
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
lading in the trade logistics network on

1100
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,320
the right

1101
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
that is needed in the trade finance

1102
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,920
network in order for the seller to prove

1103
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,760
that they actually exported the goods

1104
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,800
so

1105
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,040
how do you do that that is really what

1106
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,320
we want to enable by allowing a cross

1107
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,079
network protocol between the date

1108
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,520
finance network and the trade logistics

1109
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,119
network that will allow the tape finance

1110
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,200
network to obtain a view of the bill of

1111
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,760
lading from the data six network and

1112
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,640
then

1113
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
that is what allows the business to

1114
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,118
uh uh to

1115
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,839
force an obligation the buyer to pay the

1116
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,720
setup uh

1117
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
step six you can think of another uh the

1118
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,839
dependency on the other side where the

1119
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,960
trade logistics network uh may want to

1120
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,320
use uh

1121
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,040
to

1122
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,280
find out whether a valid letter exists

1123
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
before it allows the seller to create a

1124
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
confinement so these are real world use

1125
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
cases and

1126
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,000
the state finance network as i give

1127
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
examples you can i can think of

1128
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
bitrate or marco polo and trade

1129
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,800
logistics network uh prime example is

1130
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,040
the trade lens network that's uh run

1131
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
media maersk and

1132
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,960
uh ibm builder has built a technology

1133
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,720
for that so

1134
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,800
you can see what's happening here is in

1135
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,240
effect the

1136
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,119
asset transfer protocol or satp is

1137
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
allowing two different networks to

1138
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
interoperate with each other without

1139
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,160
forcing those two networks to join

1140
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,280
together

1141
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
in one because that's much harder thing

1142
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
to do the the two networks exist

1143
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,040
independently for a reason and they do

1144
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,560
not want to necessarily merge their

1145
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
processes together for a lot of

1146
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
different reasons uh

1147
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
this this these kind of protocols enable

1148
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
this to happen and uh

1149
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
just in case you're wondering uh

1150
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,599
this is just an example don't don't uh

1151
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,720
just

1152
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,079
fix it on the letter of credit or the

1153
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,160
bill of trading this can be really

1154
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,079
anything any kind of asset

1155
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,079
the asset semantics are restricted to

1156
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,319
their respective networks the protocol

1157
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,480
itself is communicating information does

1158
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,640
not care about what do the assets are it

1159
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,200
just cares about the fact that

1160
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
information or answers are communicated

1161
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
securely between the two networks and in

1162
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,880
this case uh between the two gateways

1163
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
that acting as spokespersons for the two

1164
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,960
networks

1165
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,440
okay i'm not going to go into this in

1166
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,599
detail just showing that we can

1167
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,359
extrapolate the example i gave in the

1168
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,040
previous slide to

1169
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
encompass the entire supply chain

1170
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,560
lifecycle uh you we added two networks

1171
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,079
food tracking network and payments

1172
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
network and you can build a much bigger

1173
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,359
uh workflow spanning all of these

1174
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
different networks you can even add a

1175
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
regulatory compliance network which

1176
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
manages kyc documents uh next slide

1177
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
okay moving to a different kind of

1178
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,480
example so the past

1179
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
few years maybe past couple of years

1180
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,079
there's been a lot of interest in cbtc

1181
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,440
right so

1182
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,359
i'm not a finance expert but what i

1183
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,040
understand from the whole cbd about the

1184
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,280
whole cbdc landscape is that you have

1185
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
you can have two different kinds of

1186
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
central bank digital currency the

1187
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,119
wholesale central bank digital currency

1188
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,920
and the retail cpc wholesale cbdc

1189
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
involves the central or the

1190
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,599
reserve bank of a country

1191
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
allowing banks to maintain

1192
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,119
reserve currency accounts

1193
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,440
with it so and you can

1194
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,599
you can transfer reserve currency

1195
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,800
the central bank can issue reserve

1196
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
currency to the commercial banks or it

1197
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,359
can

1198
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,400
redeem it at some point as well

1199
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,920
you have retail cbdc networks on the

1200
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
other hand which involves uh various

1201
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,400
commercial banks uh and their and their

1202
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,200
clients and may also involve a reserve

1203
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,880
bank just acting as sort of a regulator

1204
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,160
or an auditor

1205
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
so what can you uh

1206
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
how is this a use case for uh for that

1207
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,839
you

1208
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,760
you have a commercial banks that

1209
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,599
maintain reserve accounts in jose cbdc

1210
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,480
network at some point they may want to

1211
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,680
transfer

1212
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,599
that cbdc to the

1213
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,520
retail cptc network in which they are

1214
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,839
participating so how do you do that in a

1215
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,480
manner that is secure and which ensures

1216
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
that asset integrity is not messed up

1217
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,119
what does it mean as thomas uh talked

1218
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,880
about in the previous presentation you

1219
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,599
want to make sure that if the an asset

1220
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,720
if if some cptc gets burned in jose cbdc

1221
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,680
network uh it has to get recreated in

1222
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,520
the retail cbdc network otherwise the

1223
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
protocol ought to fail the atomicity is

1224
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,240
paramount here similarly you if a

1225
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,599
commercial bank is part of two different

1226
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
radio cbdc networks you should be able

1227
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,640
to transfer cbtc across its accounts in

1228
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,800
between from one network to the other so

1229
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,960
this provides an example of asset

1230
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,560
transfer the previous example that i

1231
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,359
showed

1232
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,440
was more along the lines of

1233
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,640
communicating

1234
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,119
asset state information in order to link

1235
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,540
workflows across two different networks

1236
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,690
[Music]

1237
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,880
okay i think i kind of covered the

1238
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,839
this is what i was talking about in the

1239
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,640
previous slide we have uh currency

1240
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,400
getting transferred from the wholesale

1241
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
to a retail cpc network or across two

1242
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
different retail cbd so i'll stop here

1243
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,880
and

1244
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,440
hi

1245
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,119
roman de niro carnegie mellon university

1246
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
could you quickly just flip back to

1247
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
maybe slide six in each one of those use

1248
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,359
cases can you state the obvious where

1249
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,000
you expect sat p to be used like where's

1250
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,440
like where's sap and this one in the

1251
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,079
previous ones thanks

1252
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,040
okay so here look at the uh

1253
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
the steps highlighted in green step 6

1254
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
and step 11 okay those are the steps

1255
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,640
that were not there in the previous

1256
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,319
diagram where i had the two networks

1257
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
disconnected from each other so here

1258
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,920
what is happening you have a trade

1259
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,839
finance network running a gateway you

1260
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,319
have a logistics network running gateway

1261
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,280
trade in step 6 state logistics network

1262
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,480
asks for

1263
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,839
uh

1264
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,920
the state of

1265
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,760
the state of a letter of credit

1266
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,520
referencing a particular purchase order

1267
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,720
which

1268
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,599
is sort of refers to the that particular

1269
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,880
trade instance

1270
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,960
the train finance network is supposed to

1271
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
then uh provide information for that

1272
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,000
along with uh some proof of authenticity

1273
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,720
so that's really it's it's a how what

1274
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,319
the information is and what the proof is

1275
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,839
that's kind of beyond the scope of the

1276
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,440
gateway between the gateways you're

1277
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,319
communicating this information the query

1278
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,000
according you supply what's called a

1279
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,240
view address and then you get a view of

1280
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
the letter predicting response and other

1281
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,000
stuff is happening behind behind the

1282
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,319
gateways uh similarly for the bill of

1283
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,920
reading this uh something similar is

1284
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,200
happening but in the

1285
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
opposite direction

1286
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,359
so in in the parlance of the t up in

1287
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,319
terms of the problem statement sat p is

1288
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,760
6 and 11 in data sharing mode

1289
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,920
right

1290
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,240
phil hanbaker have you

1291
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,839
looked at the bolero

1292
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,440
system they've been doing electronic

1293
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,119
bill of ladings for 20 years sure

1294
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,119
yeah no that's fine i mean what we are

1295
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
concerned about here is

1296
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,119
not how one particular system is

1297
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,960
processing these transactions in a

1298
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,319
secure and atomic manner but

1299
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,480
see the thing is we uh we have seen a

1300
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,400
lot of these different systems coming up

1301
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,920
a lot of different networks emerging the

1302
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,440
past few years and we don't think that

1303
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,920
there suddenly mh1 killer network on

1304
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,839
which everybody will just move their

1305
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,040
asses and

1306
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,359
run their workflows so we recognize that

1307
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,960
there are institute institutions paying

1308
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,800
power to a lot of these networks and

1309
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
assets that they maintain and we want to

1310
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,839
ensure interoperability between them

1311
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,400
that's really our primary goal

1312
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
michael

1313
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,800
yeah thanks so much uh definitely

1314
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,960
recognize the complexity of the problem

1315
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
uh and yeah sorry michael prorock

1316
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,880
speaking

1317
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,599
you know i work pretty deeply in supply

1318
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,440
chain and especially analyzing data

1319
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,359
crossing supply chain financial networks

1320
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,640
et cetera so

1321
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,560
like i said very aware of the problem

1322
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
but how would you differ this from say

1323
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,359
epcis or existing protocols

1324
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,119
for exchange of this information kind of

1325
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,960
cross different parties using

1326
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,960
standardized rest or other network

1327
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,000
channels and protocols

1328
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,400
uh

1329
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
i think the main thing we're concerned

1330
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,040
about here is that

1331
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,359
the two networks they need to

1332
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,839
conclusively communicate an asset with

1333
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,760
all security and automatic properties

1334
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
guaranteed between the between the two

1335
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,319
networks

1336
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,559
so if the

1337
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,960
the

1338
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,160
the yeah so the security properties are

1339
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,079
are paramount so i'm not uh familiar

1340
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,680
with the full details of the protocol

1341
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,359
that you mentioned but uh what we are

1342
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,119
trying to ensure is that

1343
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,839
the

1344
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,800
when

1345
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
an asset is backed by a network

1346
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,520
there is network buy-in to

1347
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,359
whatever the gators are doing

1348
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,200
that's actually quite important

1349
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,920
i i understand that but like gs1 epcis

1350
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,520
and other similar protocols in the trade

1351
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,359
networks right i mean i mean this has

1352
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,960
been done for years it's not to say

1353
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,480
there aren't improvements to be made

1354
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
there right but

1355
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,480
you know um you could still pass all of

1356
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,880
that metadata along with it so that's

1357
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,240
why i'm just trying to get some clarity

1358
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,680
about what's being added because it

1359
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,640
feels extremely complex to be discussing

1360
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,079
what it inherently is just saying

1361
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,760
network a has a piece of information

1362
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
they want to share with network b right

1363
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,079
yeah yeah look i agree so the protocols

1364
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,240
like gs1 are sort of orthogonal to what

1365
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,160
we're talking about here we do need a

1366
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,680
way for the asset uh information to be

1367
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,480
uh

1368
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,920
interoperable across different systems

1369
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,760
and this is something that uh say both

1370
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,599
like uh script are also trying to do

1371
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,079
we're trying to uh have uh standardized

1372
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,240
message formats for different kinds of

1373
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,839
assets but that's really beyond the

1374
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,359
scope of what we are trying to do here

1375
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,520
we are concerned about the semantics of

1376
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,400
asset transfer the semantics of

1377
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,079
data getting shared between two

1378
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,000
different ledgers in a way that

1379
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
convinces both the networks at the

1380
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
behind the gateways that the transaction

1381
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,079
happens securely and in

1382
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,079
in in particular cases like for asset

1383
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,440
transfer and asset exchange and an

1384
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,160
atomic panel

1385
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,319
so

1386
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,599
oh

1387
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,880
having that slide that could be helpful

1388
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
or any of those slides would be helpful

1389
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,280
uh yeah i didn't turn it off no no i

1390
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
know

1391
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,240
so

1392
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,599
i guess the question i'm trying to get

1393
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,880
at is what does this look like for the

1394
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,319
network's perspective and what i mean by

1395
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,520
this is this

1396
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,200
so we have like

1397
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,920
um we have like an existing network

1398
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
and

1399
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,040
gateway one is attached to the existing

1400
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,040
networking gear which is actually

1401
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,240
now attached to that has never been

1402
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,160
gateways in between right

1403
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,240
and so the asset left the network one

1404
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,079
and move the network too yes what does

1405
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,119
that look like for network one's

1406
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,720
perspective does it look like it moved

1407
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
to the gateway and then just sits there

1408
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,400
like what does it look like is it like

1409
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,920
attach the gateway

1410
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,119
okay there are two different ways i can

1411
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,359
answer this one short way

1412
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,599
this is how what the networks are doing

1413
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,599
behind the gateways is out of scope for

1414
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,960
our current uh uh working group but if

1415
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,640
you want the longer answer like how we

1416
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,480
can do this uh

1417
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,400
across two different networks we have we

1418
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
have built pocs and we have built uh

1419
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,079
written papers on this topic so the

1420
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,720
networks are supposed to be able to uh

1421
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,800
confirm the transactions that the

1422
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,040
gateway carrying out you cannot have the

1423
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,200
two networks just uh

1424
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,880
uh yeah

1425
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,839
but

1426
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,040
yeah i guess i mentioned i understand

1427
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,359
the answer yeah i guess but my point is

1428
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,200
like like the asset was floating around

1429
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,960
network one and it had like ledger

1430
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,200
things for network one and now it has

1431
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,640
moved to network two

1432
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,079
does that look like

1433
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,040
a

1434
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,200
does that look like a transfer with no

1435
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,520
counter like like what does it look like

1436
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,880
it's owned by the gateway and then the

1437
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,760
gateway has the property

1438
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,200
okay

1439
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,160
but once again so but once again this

1440
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,720
has enhanced the protocol we need wait

1441
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,880
wait wait wait hold up we microphone

1442
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,599
only okay

1443
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,720
but my queen is like

1444
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:03,920
okay

1445
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,960
your job

1446
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,559
that what i'm persuaded by and perhaps

1447
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,800
pursuing later is that

1448
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,720
you can take those semantic questions

1449
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,440
and push them and push them away and say

1450
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,359
it is only being hit only these areas

1451
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,640
matter and then everything else is

1452
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,640
relevant and having like worked in

1453
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,760
systems like i'm not perceived that's

1454
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,440
the case so that would be that'll be the

1455
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,400
question i'm going to have it in this

1456
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
conversation

1457
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,960
okay so let's do uh

1458
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,559
yeah

1459
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,319
i think yeah

1460
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,720
yeah we are time for this presentation

1461
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,200
um if if you feel like you're explaining

1462
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,000
enough use cases then we can go on

1463
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,440
yeah we can always come back okay

1464
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,480
great so alex you will have to

1465
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,119
you can actually just turn on your your

1466
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,359
microphone and video it'll just work yep

1467
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,720
can can everybody hear me okay

1468
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,400
you're a little quiet if you could speak

1469
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,960
a little louder that would be good

1470
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,640
okay how how is now

1471
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,839
i think i think we can make it work

1472
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,119
we'll let you know if it's too quiet go

1473
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,000
ahead

1474
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,559
okay um let me just figure out um how to

1475
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,680
uh share the slides or could i ask you

1476
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,319
to uh

1477
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,520
okay that's good all right um okay so

1478
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
i'll just start uh by saying uh

1479
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,359
apologies that martin couldn't be here

1480
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,680
uh so he was the my colleague that

1481
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,280
worked on this

1482
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,440
but okay let's move on so the secure

1483
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
asset transfer protocol defines a number

1484
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,000
of uh api endpoints identifiers and

1485
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
message flows corresponding to the asset

1486
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,559
transfer between two gateways

1487
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,800
you can move on to the next slide

1488
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
please

1489
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,880
uh so we'll start talking about uh

1490
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,839
resource descriptors resources can be

1491
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,640
uh asset identifiers uh public keys

1492
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,599
block identifiers or other items which

1493
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,599
are specific to the network

1494
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,079
you can move on please

1495
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,160
and and here we have an example of what

1496
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,839
the draft proposes

1497
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,680
a new media type will be used and the

1498
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,920
protocol is sat

1499
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,079
the organization identifier may be a

1500
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,720
legal entity identifier or another type

1501
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,119
of identifier that can link resource

1502
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,800
ownership to a real world nc

1503
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,720
so the developer or application may

1504
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,520
validate this entity with the issuing

1505
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,960
authority

1506
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
and you can see in this example we have

1507
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,960
quant

1508
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,760
the

1509
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,160
gateway id is the fully qualified domain

1510
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,720
name of the sat compliant gateway this

1511
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,440
must resolve to a valid ip address so

1512
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,559
here we say

1513
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,599
api.gateway1.com it could be it could be

1514
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,440
anything as long as it's a fully

1515
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,760
qualified domain name

1516
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,640
uh the next section is the network or

1517
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,480
system identifier

1518
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,640
oh sorry not not there's still still the

1519
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,920
greatest one yeah

1520
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,319
uh so the network or system identifier

1521
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,680
is specific to the gateway which

1522
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,760
corresponds to the target network it is

1523
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,400
used to direct sat interactions to the

1524
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
correct network

1525
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,480
for example uh we have trade lands or

1526
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,880
the eu supply chain or marco polo et

1527
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,920
cetera

1528
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
and finally the resource

1529
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,960
as mentioned specifies uh i think i lost

1530
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,240
the slides um yeah uh it it cut me off

1531
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,400
again i don't know why it's doing that

1532
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,040
it's not me

1533
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,839
uh yeah we were here

1534
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,880
so as i was saying finally the resource

1535
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,040
specifies an item held on the underlying

1536
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,839
network the string must be meaningful to

1537
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,000
the underlying network

1538
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
so some examples can be a network

1539
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,359
address a data block a transaction id

1540
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,040
an alias or a future object type not yet

1541
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,079
defined in the draft

1542
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,319
and now we can move on to the next slide

1543
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,559
so we move to the core components of the

1544
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,440
message format so sat

1545
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,960
messages are exchanged between

1546
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,720
applications and gateways they consist

1547
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,640
of protocol negotiations and functional

1548
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,079
messages

1549
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,480
the draft proposes that messages are in

1550
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,400
json format with protocol specific

1551
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,200
mandatory fields support for several

1552
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,280
authentication authorization schemes and

1553
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,400
support for a free format field for

1554
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,520
plain text or encrypted payloads

1555
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,359
on this slide we can see the proposed

1556
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,240
mandatory fields which are you know the

1557
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,119
sat protocol version a unique identifier

1558
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,359
representing a session an incrementing

1559
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,240
sequence number the sat phase

1560
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,280
a resource url a developer urn

1561
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,960
for the assertion of the developer

1562
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,559
application identity

1563
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,119
we have an action or a response which is

1564
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,240
a get or post and arguments

1565
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,400
we have a credential profile which

1566
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,359
specifies the type of authors

1567
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,599
a credential block which can have a

1568
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,119
token a certificate or a string

1569
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,960
a payload profile which defines the

1570
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,440
asset profiling capabilities

1571
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,920
an application profile and this is a

1572
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,559
vendor or application specific

1573
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,280
a payload which is specific for the sat

1574
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
phase for this message and the hash of

1575
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,760
the payload

1576
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,599
and uh finally we have a message

1577
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,839
signature which is the gateways ecdsa

1578
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,599
signature over the message

1579
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,400
and

1580
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,960
other relevant attributes may exist that

1581
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,400
need to be captured for blogging

1582
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,599
purposes

1583
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,920
but the draft goes over these in more

1584
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,160
detail we can move on to the next guys

1585
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,079
thanks

1586
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,520
next we would like to summarize the

1587
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,880
flows proposed by the sat draft

1588
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,960
so these are the transfer initiation

1589
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,599
flow so after the identity and asset

1590
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,920
verification flow with our scope a

1591
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,240
sender gateway proposes a session to a

1592
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,480
receiver gateway we have the lock

1593
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,720
evidence verification flow a conveyance

1594
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,799
of claims regarding the lock status of a

1595
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,480
digital asset by one gateway and

1596
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,160
verificat the verification of the

1597
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
evidence by the other gateway

1598
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,160
and finally we have the commitment

1599
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,240
establishment flow

1600
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,599
which is the asset transfer and

1601
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,520
commitment establishment between two

1602
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,240
gateways on behalf of their respective

1603
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,400
networks

1604
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,040
we can move on

1605
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,680
so

1606
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,079
these following slides will uh outline

1607
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,240
the flows uh but we're mostly going to

1608
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,480
cover the purpose of the messages so

1609
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,559
for the first flow we have two messages

1610
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,400
being exchanged the

1611
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,720
initialization request message and and

1612
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,200
the corresponding response

1613
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,000
um the first one the initialization

1614
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,359
request message

1615
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,839
uh is sent from the sender gateway to

1616
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,760
the recipient gateway and the purpose of

1617
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,920
it is for the clients to initiate an

1618
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,000
asset transfer

1619
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,880
after receiving the smart message the uh

1620
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
recipient gateway needs to validate the

1621
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,200
profiles if everything is approved the

1622
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,480
recipient gateway constructs the

1623
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,280
response message and uh the purpose of

1624
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,799
this is for the shipping gateway to

1625
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,200
indicate agreement to actually proceed

1626
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,280
with the operations

1627
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,880
we can move on to next slide please

1628
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,280
next we have this lock evidence

1629
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,160
verification flow um so this is

1630
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,880
comprised of four message exchanges so

1631
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,960
two messages and acknowledgements for

1632
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,160
each of them

1633
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,400
the transfer commence message is sent

1634
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,160
from the sender gateway to the recipient

1635
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,160
gateway and it signals that the sender

1636
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,040
is ready for to start the transfer

1637
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,880
so it must contain

1638
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,799
claims related to the information from

1639
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,240
the previous flow

1640
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,079
and the response to this is to indicate

1641
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,680
agreements to proceed with asset

1642
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,960
transfer

1643
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,440
next we have the

1644
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,240
uh

1645
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,240
lock evidence message and this is sent

1646
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,240
by the sender gateway to the recipient

1647
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,119
and it conveys claims of the locking or

1648
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,960
escrow of the asset on the respective

1649
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,359
network

1650
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,280
and the receipting gateway must validate

1651
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,440
these claims and then proceed to respond

1652
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,000
with the lock evidence response message

1653
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,920
in this message the recipient gateway

1654
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,000
indicates that it accepts the claims of

1655
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,079
the escrow of the assets from the

1656
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,799
previous message

1657
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,880
we can move on to the

1658
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,720
next slide

1659
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,960
finally we have the commit establishment

1660
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,839
flow

1661
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,720
um so the commit preparation message has

1662
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,359
the purpose of indicating its readiness

1663
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,400
to begin the commitment of the transfer

1664
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,920
the response to this message is an

1665
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,680
indication from the recipient gateway

1666
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,760
that it is also ready to proceed with

1667
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,960
the commitment of the

1668
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,799
sorry with the commitment finalization

1669
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,880
step

1670
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,920
um

1671
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,760
and then we have the commit final

1672
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,680
message message and this is for the

1673
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
sender gateway to signify that it has

1674
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,680
completed the local extinguishment of

1675
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,680
the asset on its network and the

1676
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,440
receiving gateway can proceed to

1677
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,880
regenerate the asset on its

1678
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,400
corresponding network or system

1679
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,640
and the response to this must contain

1680
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,119
claims that the asset was regenerated on

1681
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,359
on that respective network uh in this

1682
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,920
case for gateway 2 on the picture

1683
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,280
and finally we have the transfer

1684
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,359
complete message which is uh for the

1685
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,880
sender gateway to indicate that the

1686
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
transfer has been completed and no

1687
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,640
further messages are to be expected

1688
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,520
um so that's about it uh for this brief

1689
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,839
overview of course uh the draft covers

1690
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,880
all of these topics in much more detail

1691
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,839
yeah thank you for listening

1692
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,040
okay so that was the protocol flow if

1693
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,640
anybody has clarifying questions about

1694
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,240
the protocol really just you know how

1695
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,400
does it work or or questions not whether

1696
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,119
it's

1697
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,200
you know appropriate or not

1698
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,720
please come now and then after that we

1699
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,400
will do open mic where we can discuss

1700
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,880
heavily the

1701
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,839
issues with the entire set of proposals

1702
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,558
any clarifying questions

1703
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,680
all right

1704
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,599
hearing none

1705
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,160
um then we will go on to

1706
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,720
the uh

1707
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,200
the real brunt of the day and and we

1708
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,839
will go back to

1709
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,720
let's remind ourselves of the purpose of

1710
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,040
a buff right so

1711
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,720
there's there's a number of things that

1712
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,839
um

1713
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,280
we've already sort of brought up and i'm

1714
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,160
going to reiterate those in a minute but

1715
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,920
is the ietf the right place is it a

1716
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,599
tractable problem all those types of

1717
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,480
things i'll note that so far you know

1718
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,920
we've certainly talked about a number of

1719
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,599
i think critical issues

1720
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,240
one being you know is voluntary or

1721
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,079
involuntary transfers which of those two

1722
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,359
are in scope

1723
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,760
um is it tractable to only do voluntary

1724
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,839
i think was brought up at one point

1725
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,599
when it is voluntary who's actually

1726
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,119
doing the request there seemed to be

1727
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,040
some confusion about that does the asset

1728
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,040
owner you know actually initiate request

1729
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,359
does the network of the asset owner

1730
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,839
initiate it does the gateway initiate it

1731
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,200
uh how is that you know locking

1732
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
mechanism to some extent that is in the

1733
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,359
out of scope section for

1734
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,920
uh how the uh the proponents have

1735
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,160
structured their their initial stab at a

1736
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,599
working group charter

1737
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,039
uh the other big one that was brought up

1738
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,880
was trust really there's sort of two

1739
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,599
types of trust that i i heard described

1740
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,920
one was you know internet work client to

1741
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,760
gateway again that sort of declared out

1742
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,359
of scope and then there's trust between

1743
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,480
gateway to gateway um and you know

1744
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,839
it sounded like there was some sort of

1745
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,280
legal frameworks that might be needed to

1746
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,559
actually back up you know trade

1747
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,319
memberships and things like that

1748
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,880
but the key question is can a protocol

1749
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,960
actually be trusted if we don't define

1750
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,200
complete end-to-end example now

1751
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,480
so that was sort of brought up that if

1752
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,920
you only define the gateway to gateway

1753
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,440
now then you don't get the binding that

1754
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,520
you get with you know trying to deal

1755
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,599
with how does that work inside of a

1756
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,200
particular network

1757
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,440
uh so with that i'll open the floor to

1758
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,119
you know general discussion at this

1759
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,599
point um ideally we'll have time later

1760
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,880
for a charter but i think the general

1761
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,559
discussion will decide whether uh we

1762
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,720
should do a charter or not so who wants

1763
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,598
to start the discussion

1764
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,559
there we go ben

1765
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,640
so i think there's a few topics that

1766
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,920
have come up that seem to me to indicate

1767
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,000
that we're maybe implicitly making some

1768
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,440
assumptions about the nature of the

1769
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,240
networks uh at the source and recipient

1770
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,039
ends

1771
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,200
in terms of like there's some concept of

1772
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,359
being able to lock an asset or to be

1773
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,359
able to support an asset disappearing

1774
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,680
from the network or something like that

1775
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,799
uh and so it might be useful to explore

1776
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,559
which of these aspects are actually

1777
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,160
requirements in order to be able to do

1778
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,480
this at all or just and which are just

1779
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,119
sort of things that are convenient for

1780
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,680
the current proposed solutions but not

1781
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,160
necessarily core aspects of the problem

1782
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,039
itself

1783
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,160
and i don't have an answer to that

1784
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,839
offhand so i will drop out of the queue

1785
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,680
and let's finals go i can try answer

1786
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,200
that then so so

1787
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,640
so in the protocol itself there's a

1788
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,880
thing called a blob called a lock we

1789
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,520
just is called lock evidence right and

1790
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,079
what that conveys is evidence that that

1791
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,200
the gateway one has somehow disabled

1792
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,640
temporarily

1793
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,799
this asset in network one and this

1794
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,960
evidence has to be delivered to

1795
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,680
gateway two and gateway two has to read

1796
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,280
this and assess whether there's an

1797
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,359
acceptable level of locking or

1798
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,720
disablement

1799
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,480
and

1800
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,240
we too has to know about the network

1801
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,880
protocol used yes so so

1802
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,559
in phase zero

1803
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,720
uh gateway one has to tell gateway to

1804
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,200
this is my type of network this is the

1805
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,280
blob the locking blob structure that i

1806
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,480
will use

1807
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,640
do you understand my blob if you don't

1808
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
then forget about the transaction

1809
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,000
if you do then proceed and so the

1810
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,680
question for us right now is do we

1811
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,160
define that locking block

1812
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,400
we haven't decided yet maybe it's in

1813
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,319
scope right now i kind of feel it's out

1814
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,160
of scope because it's just too much work

1815
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,039
to do

1816
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,440
but but absolutely great question

1817
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,599
because that is one of the core sort of

1818
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,599
features of that we need to address what

1819
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,240
is this evidence blob look like

1820
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,680
sure thanks for the clarification

1821
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
dave

1822
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,799
okay uh dave faber uh the bottom

1823
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,319
question on this slide is is the working

1824
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,480
group likely to succeed

1825
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,880
and i'm gonna answer this from the 5218

1826
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,319
what makes for a successful protocol

1827
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,359
right because you can argue that a

1828
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,799
working group would be successful if it

1829
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,799
publishes an rfc that's not my

1830
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,039
definition uh my definition is a working

1831
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,240
group is successful if it makes a

1832
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,839
standard that actually gets deployed and

1833
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,400
used okay and so uh that's how i'm

1834
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,920
interpreting that question

1835
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,720
and so i'm gonna give uh my thoughts as

1836
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,680
to how to make it not fail i mean by by

1837
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,039
changing the scope but i can't prove

1838
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,079
that it will succeed because that

1839
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,760
requires information i don't have

1840
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,440
um about whether people would actually

1841
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,319
use it

1842
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,319
um where presumably you guys know that

1843
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,599
better than i do in terms of the use

1844
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,880
cases

1845
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,319
yeah yeah yeah right in his presentation

1846
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,760
he actually covered that right alex

1847
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,240
didn't tell about that

1848
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,760
so i'm going to trust you that yes as

1849
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,799
long as you do certain things that

1850
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,000
people will deploy it but yeah i'm

1851
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,280
looking to yeah yeah um but i would say

1852
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,640
that um

1853
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,480
as long as you scoop things down i think

1854
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,760
it's tractable

1855
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,359
as long as you scoop things down by

1856
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,799
changing some terminology or maybe

1857
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,119
changing the scope or whatever wording

1858
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,200
to still tailor it specifically to the

1859
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,280
use cases that you walk us through

1860
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,559
so for example

1861
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,720
if you uh don't mention

1862
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,240
you either don't mention legal

1863
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,839
recognition

1864
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,680
the option a or b

1865
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,200
scope it to where

1866
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,520
there's a common agreement within the

1867
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,799
system of what that legal framework is

1868
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,319
and that could be a treaty it could be a

1869
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,920
single jurisdiction whatever it is as

1870
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,119
long as there's general agreement on

1871
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,200
what that means then you've removed the

1872
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,559
part that makes it not one of the parts

1873
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,400
that makes it not detractable okay i

1874
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,599
think within the examples that you

1875
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,359
showed in the use cases document i think

1876
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,559
that assumption holds but you know

1877
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,400
better than i do okay so as long as you

1878
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,680
scope it down it says okay there's a

1879
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,920
common agreement on what legal

1880
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,240
ownership means okay

1881
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,000
and then you scope it down to say

1882
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,240
voluntary only

1883
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,920
okay because you could probably do that

1884
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,880
in the context of a particular

1885
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,720
definition of what the legal

1886
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,240
jurisdiction is all the entities are

1887
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,920
equal in the same

1888
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,520
jurisdiction whatever then you then i

1889
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,640
think that the architecture and the

1890
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,200
protocol can probably apply okay what i

1891
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,559
don't know that it was kind of a

1892
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,240
question that uh phil kind of begged

1893
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,359
right was

1894
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,280
should something where a legal thing

1895
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,400
come along and say if i can't do

1896
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,079
involuntary i'll just ban it right i

1897
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,200
can't comment on whether that will

1898
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,799
happen because i don't know enough

1899
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,240
but as far as taking the architecture

1900
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,680
make it be tractable from an engineering

1901
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,280
point of view right because often

1902
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,720
engineering principles and legal

1903
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,319
infrastructures

1904
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,720
may not be consistent with each other

1905
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,400
and we're engineers here

1906
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,000
so i would scoop it down to say okay

1907
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,640
voluntary only but there is a common

1908
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,000
understanding of what the legal

1909
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,480
framework is okay and within that narrow

1910
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,680
scope

1911
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,280
then i think it's tractable whether it's

1912
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,880
going to be deployed i leave that to you

1913
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,319
and to others to comment down so thanks

1914
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,240
closer to the mic please um

1915
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,760
and certainly you know one thing that i

1916
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,359
would love to hear would be are there

1917
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,559
other people besides the three

1918
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,240
proponents that have given presentations

1919
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,680
that you know would want to deploy

1920
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,039
something like this so that we actually

1921
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,400
get you know

1922
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,720
one hand over here but uh oh two

1923
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,000
excellent

1924
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,319
uh colin

1925
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,839
actually those two hands go exactly to

1926
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,319
my i i'm actually on the problem means

1927
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,440
solving so i'm trying to get my head

1928
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,640
around this one a little bit more i'm

1929
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,719
thinking about that aspect of of the

1930
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,679
buff

1931
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,640
and um i i get how this would connect

1932
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,198
the networks i i i got your example with

1933
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,799
the finance network

1934
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,560
um

1935
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,158
but you know the next thing we heard at

1936
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:29,839
the mic is yeah but that's already a

1937
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,839
well-solved problem so i'm trying to get

1938
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,158
i think it would help you

1939
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,839
develop energy and get things here if

1940
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:37,839
you could say more about

1941
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,920
specific use cases that are fairly

1942
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
concrete where where this type of

1943
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,759
technology could help

1944
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,479
and uh particularly ones that weren't

1945
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,560
already solved today and would be people

1946
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,479
who really wanted to deploy that so i

1947
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:51,679
don't know if you can comment anymore on

1948
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,960
that now or whether that something

1949
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,640
happens later but that's that's

1950
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,479
something where i feel like i

1951
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,479
i i could learn more and it would be

1952
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,000
really compelling to help me understand

1953
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,279
like yeah this problem needs to be

1954
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,238
solved thanks

1955
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,880
i can comment on what we have done so

1956
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,759
there are

1957
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,120
things in the pipeline that i can't

1958
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,799
comment about but what i can comment

1959
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,399
about uh is

1960
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,560
uh if you check you'll find a couple of

1961
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,158
press releases from last december where

1962
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:16,880
we

1963
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,600
uh conducted an experimental poc

1964
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,198
involving the

1965
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,238
bank of france and hsbc where we they

1966
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,319
both have networks built on different

1967
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,399
technologies one of them has network

1968
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,040
managing cptc and a coupon payment

1969
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,719
workflow and securities and stuff like

1970
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,319
that on a

1971
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,759
network based on hyperledger fabric

1972
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,000
another one had something similar uh

1973
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,198
slightly different workflow but still

1974
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:41,600
managing cpdc and security's assets on

1975
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,640
the corda on the corder platform and we

1976
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,960
built several different use cases uh

1977
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,799
connecting the two different networks be

1978
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,359
able to uh atomically exchange assets

1979
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,158
across each other to be able to transfer

1980
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,159
asset from one network to the other to

1981
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,960
be able to communicate views of uh let's

1982
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,719
say a

1983
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,320
coupon state from one network to other

1984
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,480
things like this so we did this and it

1985
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,719
was uh perceived to be a pretty success

1986
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,920
as an experiment so in the cbdc world

1987
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,440
we're going to see more and more such

1988
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,960
cases emerging and

1989
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,120
if cbdc is going to be a reality as most

1990
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,960
governments seem to want to make it so

1991
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,960
then this is going to be a necessity

1992
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,719
like very very soon so certainly

1993
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,400
bringing running code to the table is an

1994
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,320
excellent thing can you describe to the

1995
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,840
other half of this question though which

1996
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,159
was that why couldn't an existing

1997
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:31,839
protocol be used in that situation

1998
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,800
so uh the thing that we are we

1999
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,640
specifically tried to solve again giving

2000
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,800
an example of the system that i finally

2001
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,560
maintained wrong it's called vivo and

2002
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,640
it's it's about enabling two different

2003
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,560
decentralized ledger networks to be able

2004
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,280
to uh interoperate with each other so

2005
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,719
part of that and really what we're

2006
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,760
focusing on with satp is uh how do you

2007
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,040
enable the

2008
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,880
uh the two the the proxy the

2009
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,520
spokespersons of the of two networks to

2010
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,840
be able to securely communicate their

2011
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,719
assets or asset state views across each

2012
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,239
other that's a part of

2013
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,679
the bigger scheme now of course when we

2014
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,040
we're building something for for a

2015
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,120
client we're going to be uh doing the

2016
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,640
whole entering process so that's really

2017
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,640
not part of the scope here but

2018
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,320
definitely a key part of that is the

2019
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,679
ability for

2020
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,159
uh two gateways of two networks to be

2021
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,360
able to communicate with each other and

2022
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,719
gateway is really i think somebody

2023
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,560
released the question earlier uh what's

2024
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,719
the gateway

2025
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,800
yeah how how do what how the network

2026
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,560
structure involves we don't have to go

2027
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,120
into that but to be able to communicate

2028
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,800
something institutionally between two

2029
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,560
networks you don't need it you cannot

2030
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,679
discuss with that whatever kind of

2031
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,679
protocol uh we are talking about

2032
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,960
whatever use case you're talking about

2033
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,960
this is

2034
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,280
uh not really a solved problem in the in

2035
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,719
the decentralized network space you have

2036
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,640
two different decentralized networks how

2037
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,960
exactly are they supposed to trust uh

2038
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,239
what's happening in other networks

2039
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,760
because in effect what we're trying to

2040
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,000
do is enable a cross-country transaction

2041
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,199
that's flying to different networks if

2042
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,440
you think of it absolutely that way

2043
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,520
you need something like this and it's a

2044
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,199
problem that you've been trying to solve

2045
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,239
the past few years and you made uh take

2046
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,840
a lot of steps towards it but it's not

2047
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,280
really the same problem as the classical

2048
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,199
problem of let's say we're using like

2049
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,280
two pcs vp it's not the same problem

2050
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,800
that uh we encounter 30 years ago

2051
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,400
uh bernie i don't know if you're

2052
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,600
talking you're way too quiet

2053
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,280
okay

2054
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
oh i don't see this mic line on though

2055
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,000
oh there he is okay try again bernie

2056
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,600
okay is it all better

2057
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,400
yes that's better thank you okay sorry

2058
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,400
so my question is in the area of like

2059
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,280
end-to-end and gateway to gateway uh as

2060
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,440
i understood the problem protocol will

2061
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,320
be developed gateway to gateway only

2062
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,159
is that uh

2063
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,719
does that mean

2064
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,719
yeah can you type the question into the

2065
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,320
chat bernie you're still very quiet you

2066
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,480
could try yelling if you want but

2067
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,239
okay i'll type you to the check there

2068
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,239
okay thank you in the meanwhile um i'll

2069
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,400
read that off in a minute roman

2070
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,880
uh hi roman union carnegie mellon uh

2071
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,159
just kind of thinking that you presented

2072
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,280
both with the use cases and the

2073
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,800
protocols the protocol in particular

2074
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,880
flow was super helpful uh if we think

2075
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,320
about this as just as a distributed

2076
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,159
systems problem and we made the

2077
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,440
assumption that i think we talked about

2078
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,679
before which is the asset is opaque

2079
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,360
we're assuming nothing about what's

2080
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,679
behind the gateway and we said we need a

2081
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,560
three pc and some security

2082
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,000
what are the other properties we need to

2083
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,440
make sure that are baked into the

2084
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
protocol

2085
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,719
i mean i heard a little bit about the

2086
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,719
locking

2087
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,880
acid that's a property so cross network

2088
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,800
atomicity so acid transfer and acid

2089
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,640
exchange you need to make sure that if

2090
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,239
an acid gets burnt in one network it has

2091
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,600
to get recreated in the other or it

2092
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,400
doesn't get burnt and acid swap is

2093
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,120
either it changes hands in both ways or

2094
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,320
in either direction that's the problem

2095
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,280
to me and actually we're asking you guys

2096
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,719
any other properties we've missed

2097
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,880
because we say security and liveliness

2098
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,199
like as a hand sweep but it might be

2099
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,080
more

2100
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,000
we've been focusing on the asset

2101
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,480
properties that ended up choosing 3 pc

2102
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,679
instead of 2pc even bpc is safer

2103
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:36,159
okay thanks okay uh bernie did you want

2104
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,760
to try again i think you came back you

2105
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,159
left and came back

2106
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,640
well is my audio better now

2107
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,480
no you're still too quiet

2108
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,480
okay

2109
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,840
if you can type it into the chat i'll

2110
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,080
read it

2111
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:58,880
so

2112
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,320
i'm concerned we are following your trap

2113
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,480
here which we often see at itf which is

2114
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,760
a few people interested in something

2115
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,280
come to us for something which is

2116
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,360
embedded in a much larger context and

2117
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,480
which can't be understood without that

2118
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,320
context and we don't have that context

2119
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,600
and we're asked to define this like very

2120
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,199
narrow piece so it's like we're building

2121
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,800
a rocket and could you please design the

2122
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,480
upholstery and that's concerns me um so

2123
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,840
maybe they're like i like around this

2124
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,440
room and i see a lot of people i already

2125
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,679
know and i know did not work in this

2126
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,000
field um and so

2127
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,880
like

2128
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,719
my question is like who are the relevant

2129
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:29,920
people i have in this room for us to

2130
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,760
actually solve this problem in a

2131
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,199
reasonable way and i'm not going to

2132
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,480
listen to you when you tell me that i

2133
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,760
don't have to worry about the embedding

2134
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,960
because i don't believe that this

2135
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,320
that's not what i mean like you can't

2136
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,239
work when you're the only pipeline in

2137
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,560
this community so the people who are the

2138
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,159
consumers of the technology have to be

2139
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:49,760
here in this room

2140
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,600
through it with us hold on sorry that's

2141
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,159
it can i ask a a

2142
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,280
a clarifying question yes question

2143
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,960
totally get it right and the other thing

2144
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,159
that people do all the time is they come

2145
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,520
to the ietf and they bring such a

2146
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,280
monstrosity that we curve it down into a

2147
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,880
very minimum so you know finding that

2148
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,400
middle line is hard so

2149
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,560
do you have a notion in your head of

2150
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,560
what you think the bare minimum pieces

2151
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,000
would be

2152
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,080
in order to you know is it includes like

2153
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,600
you know do we need to define inner

2154
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,280
network transfers and locking and things

2155
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,560
like that i mean

2156
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,400
you don't know because i have no idea

2157
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,280
because i was completely unable to

2158
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,880
understand the context

2159
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,719
um so like and it's precisely what i'm

2160
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,560
saying is that like what is necessary

2161
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,400
here is the people who are

2162
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,320
okay consumers of technology have to

2163
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,440
come here

2164
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,640
and have to work with us to develop it

2165
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,679
if we're gonna develop it because

2166
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,280
otherwise we're developing according to

2167
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,880
requirements which thought they don't

2168
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,159
like you not they don't trust you but

2169
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,360
they came from you and did not come from

2170
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,000
that community as well

2171
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,040
so

2172
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,159
i invite those people to come to

2173
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,159
microphone

2174
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,719
so um

2175
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,560
i'm not i'm not sure what the problem's

2176
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,480
tractable from the way i look at it and

2177
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,159
it may be it means that i just think

2178
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,719
that it needs to have more constraints

2179
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,040
as to under what scenarios this might

2180
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,239
fail

2181
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,040
and

2182
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,280
um and exactly i think those listed out

2183
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,239
and what happens because that's the

2184
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,040
thing that i'm most worried about is

2185
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,440
what's the trust relationship between

2186
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,080
the two gateways effectively and if one

2187
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,280
of them says

2188
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,320
actually

2189
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,239
i've failed to commit this can you roll

2190
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,080
back for example

2191
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,760
what stops that gateway from actually

2192
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,000
committing that asset to that new

2193
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,960
network and asking another gateway to

2194
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,920
uh to effectively keep it alive or vice

2195
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,000
versa those sorts of questions these are

2196
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,239
the exact questions

2197
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,760
these are good questions

2198
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,679
and because i think that again back

2199
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:40,480
earlier

2200
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,280
earlier

2201
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,840
i think three-phase commit guarantees

2202
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,840
the acid properties under

2203
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,159
certain boundary conditions and in the

2204
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,719
real world those sometimes fail and i

2205
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,239
think in the real world when those fail

2206
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,760
you have a human come and has to come

2207
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,400
sort things out so i think if you scope

2208
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,960
those things down and say it works in

2209
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,560
the mainline cases here these are the

2210
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,199
cases where things can go wrong and

2211
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,040
you'll need some outer bound way of

2212
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,880
resolving this then i think it is

2213
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,320
tractable but you know can you get a

2214
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,800
network or protocol to solve this and

2215
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,920
guarantee

2216
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,840
you make a transactional change between

2217
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,080
two discrete points in the world at the

2218
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,600
same time i think that's happens no

2219
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,400
this is great input i do honestly yeah

2220
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,760
there's some point in time in the

2221
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,080
transaction where a human has to come in

2222
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,480
you know some i.t guys okay we gotta

2223
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,239
we're gonna you know do something yeah

2224
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,000
it's that's a perfectly reasonable you

2225
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,320
know scenario okay let's put it another

2226
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,159
way you're sort of asking where does

2227
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,760
like the legal framework have to take

2228
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,400
over

2229
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,600
you know to cover the cases where the

2230
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,360
protocol can't solve right that would be

2231
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,360
another way of looking at it yeah uh

2232
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,960
bernie wrote his question so let me read

2233
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,080
it um

2234
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,159
the first presenter mentioned the scope

2235
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,560
to be only gateway to gateway is it

2236
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,719
meant that the protocol will be designed

2237
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,440
to only work you know gateway to gateway

2238
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,360
or will there be room for a possible

2239
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,280
later extension to make this work end to

2240
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,520
end this is relevant example for cases

2241
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,080
where gateways are hacked

2242
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,000
right now it's just gateway the gateway

2243
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,920
and when we sort of finish that you know

2244
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,920
it it's it's up to the itf if you know

2245
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,440
later on you're gonna extend that to end

2246
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,800
to end you know originate at the

2247
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,440
beneficiary

2248
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,320
so hi phil handbaker

2249
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,000
uh

2250
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,880
i'm not sure that us

2251
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,159
the way that you're scoping it at the

2252
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,679
moment taking the networks out

2253
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,840
completely

2254
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,000
depending upon the properties of that

2255
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,080
network

2256
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,320
i think i can simplify the protocol

2257
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,320
substantially

2258
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,560
in that if you have structured

2259
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,320
cryptography

2260
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,159
going that gives you the ability and

2261
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,480
access to some proofs that otherwise you

2262
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,000
wouldn't have

2263
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,719
so you might not want to do that

2264
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,400
but

2265
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:03,440
from the point of view of the planet

2266
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,360
i am very very concerned of any action

2267
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,000
of the itf

2268
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,760
that will be seen as endorsing

2269
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,199
bitcoin

2270
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:16,880
proof of work

2271
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,000
the destruction of our planet

2272
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,520
you know those people are using one

2273
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,719
percent

2274
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:23,760
of the

2275
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,080
global energy

2276
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,480
they've constructed a ponzi scheme that

2277
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,719
has destroyed

2278
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,960
at least a hundred billion dollars of

2279
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,560
wealth

2280
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,760
and is in the pr

2281
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,159
and those are relevant when it comes to

2282
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,840
if the itf starts a working group

2283
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,400
that may be take that is going to be

2284
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,440
used

2285
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,239
as a way of endorsing that whole field

2286
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,320
and i think that the itf has to be very

2287
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,360
careful

2288
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,520
before it takes any step

2289
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,800
that would be interpreted in that way

2290
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,480
certainly interpretation brings an

2291
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,920
interesting question but i'll note that

2292
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,520
we already have invented something that

2293
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,159
has helped bitcoin and other you know

2294
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,000
realms work right it's called tcp

2295
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,679
they're communicating their transactions

2296
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:08,560
over it

2297
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,679
so

2298
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,440
the you know the point of this group was

2299
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,080
to transfer digital assets and yes it

2300
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,159
could be misused for something that we

2301
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,000
don't like

2302
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,560
in your camp otherwise but

2303
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,239
michael

2304
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,800
sorry just to add to philip's question

2305
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,159
just for an answer

2306
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,920
um i think during our conversations for

2307
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,480
uh the drafts and everything uh we knew

2308
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,719
there were networks like bitcoin or

2309
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,199
ethereum which um have this sort of

2310
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,800
negative impact on the world at the

2311
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,280
moment but you'll notice that in our use

2312
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,840
cases and mostly in our conversation as

2313
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,520
well we focus on

2314
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,239
networks based on technologies such as

2315
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,120
hyperledger fabric or corda or even

2316
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,760
other things which are more on the

2317
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,080
permission side of networks rather than

2318
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,480
permission less but let's not go into

2319
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,080
that direction necessarily but it's just

2320
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,760
that i think this is you know something

2321
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,480
that we should keep in mind indeed

2322
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,599
when it comes to this protocol

2323
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,199
the whole problem of fragmentation and

2324
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,679
the need to communicate assets

2325
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,440
arises because of we have so many

2326
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,639
permission networks that are actually

2327
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:17,840
doing things

2328
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,920
which uh we already did in the real

2329
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,679
world we're just trying to digitize

2330
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,960
policies that were sort

2331
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,159
yeah my uh michael perak here again um i

2332
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,760
just wanted to get some clarity because

2333
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,320
i think you know for sure i look at the

2334
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,560
general both goals c for sure yes

2335
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,920
problem needs solving right it's

2336
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,639
something i encounter constantly right

2337
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,400
um but

2338
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,239
you know one of the clarity things for

2339
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,560
me is every example you've given has

2340
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,040
been either hyper ledger or some you

2341
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,600
know dlt type approach etc

2342
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
is this intended to work across the

2343
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,600
board regardless of that is that kind of

2344
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,440
what you're saying like that's why the

2345
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,320
networks are out of scope for us

2346
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,719
but like no i don't get hyperledger

2347
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,159
fabric or anything

2348
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,600
but well i mean what about just like a

2349
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,600
traditional database right like

2350
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,239
or something else right a flat file

2351
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,000
and that's why yeah no that's a good

2352
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,560
question so we want to make it uh so

2353
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,560
that in fact instead of a network it

2354
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,480
could be a monolithic database on one

2355
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,040
side okay because g2 doesn't know that

2356
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,800
it's actually a database as opposed to

2357
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
just a network that might be helpful to

2358
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
bring into the examples because if it

2359
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,280
and and if we are talking because so

2360
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,159
much has come back to like dlt type you

2361
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,159
know or ledger type examples and things

2362
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,280
like that

2363
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,080
and

2364
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,080
obviously there has to be some bridge

2365
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,840
between that kind of stuff because that

2366
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,760
stuff is out there right it's not gonna

2367
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,679
it may not go away overnight it may

2368
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,080
never go away you know we don't know

2369
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,360
actually actually

2370
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,159
alex i know um martin has explained in

2371
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,120
some of the

2372
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,880
meetings in the part of this that in

2373
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,440
fact these guys and you can have

2374
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,679
have a deployed solution one side is in

2375
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,320
fact a monolithic sort of banking

2376
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,480
computer it's not even a okay that that

2377
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,320
that's helpful have you thought through

2378
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,760
things like these centralized

2379
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,600
identifiers which are now a spec and

2380
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,840
things like that right because there are

2381
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,440
aspects touching on this and other

2382
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,239
standards orgs also aspects i mean you

2383
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,520
know i'm looking at this and going well

2384
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,199
why wouldn't i just make a bunch of jobs

2385
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,040
or cwts right

2386
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,440
exchanging these claims so come and join

2387
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,880
us and oh

2388
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,159
excellent

2389
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,960
no no yeah seriously you know these are

2390
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,880
the sequence of questions the corollary

2391
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,800
questions that are adding up and we're

2392
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,320
like okay this is a this is a lot of

2393
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,559
work

2394
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,280
again the the reason why the examples

2395
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,440
focus on decentralized ledger networks

2396
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,840
is because it's strictly taking a newer

2397
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,960
and harder problem to solve

2398
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,960
so mun thompson uh i'm looking at these

2399
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,920
questions here and these are good

2400
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,159
questions these are the usual questions

2401
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,360
unsurprising

2402
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,719
um

2403
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,719
bernie asked a question about end to end

2404
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:01,600
and

2405
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,320
that was very quickly waved out of scope

2406
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,840
um

2407
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,960
the

2408
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,480
discussion here we talked about locking

2409
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,880
and various other things

2410
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,440
and being able to assert to the your

2411
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,280
counterparty that you have a lock on the

2412
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,120
thing that's being transferred that to

2413
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,080
me suggests that the the scope is a lie

2414
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,639
i i have a very hard time believing that

2415
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,199
you can implement something like this by

2416
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,440
putting that stuff out of scope

2417
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,239
um

2418
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,560
when it is so fundamental to the

2419
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,320
protocol here that we're talking about

2420
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,840
delivering

2421
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,560
but

2422
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,400
i don't want you to answer that question

2423
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,880
i think that until we've um

2424
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,520
dealt with the question of constituency

2425
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,480
none of this matters very much so i see

2426
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,880
a few people here who are interested in

2427
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,320
pushing this forward

2428
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,840
but i'm not

2429
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,719
seeing

2430
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,320
evidence that the people who would be

2431
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,560
deploying it here in the room and that

2432
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,159
that concerns me so

2433
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:56,960
um

2434
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,800
the point i can made earlier

2435
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,239
until that is answered i think that uh

2436
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,199
the

2437
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,480
third question

2438
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,960
and the sixth question

2439
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,280
have answers of no right now

2440
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,840
uh so if any of the people that are

2441
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,280
interested in deploying this want to

2442
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,880
speak to their particular environment

2443
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,719
that would certainly be helpful at this

2444
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,560
point and i invite them to come to the

2445
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,560
microphone

2446
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,840
yeah uh what do you call it my phone

2447
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,480
isn't working with the authorization

2448
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,080
thing so i think your name and

2449
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,639
affiliation uh i'm rebecca i'm with 14

2450
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:35,760
bis

2451
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,840
we deal with supply tracking and we

2452
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,239
mostly deal with at the moment hybrid

2453
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,280
assets so basically like actual parts

2454
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,639
that have like

2455
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,760
you know uh ids associated with them and

2456
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,600
ownership is like digitally recorded

2457
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,960
and

2458
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,880
like a lot of times um currently that

2459
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,679
with the clients we manage like it's uh

2460
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,000
everything is on like a hyper ledger

2461
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
like fabric network

2462
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,120
and everything is internal but we can

2463
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,880
see like in the future

2464
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,960
if like for example our clients are

2465
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,199
transferring assets that we did not

2466
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:14,239
create for them for example like uh off

2467
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:15,520
another

2468
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,000
client of theirs like network this could

2469
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,920
be something that's like interesting to

2470
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,320
us and we would want to establish a

2471
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,800
protocol obviously we would have to work

2472
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,400
with however

2473
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,280
their clients like you know

2474
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,280
are dealing with how they handle like

2475
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,120
their own assets and data and we would

2476
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,400
have to build a specific

2477
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,040
set of rules for our gateways but

2478
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,320
this is definitely something we're

2479
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,159
interested in great thank you very much

2480
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:48,800
hi i'm john robotham i'm with ernst

2481
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,840
young

2482
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,960
and

2483
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,880
we deal with these problems of

2484
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,960
either permissioned

2485
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,159
blockchains talking to other permission

2486
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,000
blockchains or

2487
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,920
permissionless ones talking to

2488
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,440
permissionless

2489
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,840
or you know you name the the

2490
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,600
combinatorics

2491
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,480
um

2492
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,280
it's

2493
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,280
the these are our

2494
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,320
you know critical problems i would also

2495
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,840
point out that

2496
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,040
a fair amount of the threat the theft

2497
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,040
going on right now

2498
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,320
in um in permissionless blockchains

2499
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,400
happens at the gateways

2500
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,360
um that's that's usually the the vector

2501
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,800
of attack

2502
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,600
so

2503
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,760
these things you know what we're talking

2504
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,920
about here i'm actively participating in

2505
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,520
this working group

2506
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,679
and i think it's it's very important

2507
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,199
for us in both financial and supply

2508
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,679
chain kinds of applications

2509
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,360
okay thank you do you have a deployment

2510
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
case

2511
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,239
all right

2512
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,400
go ahead

2513
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,400
please do use the q button on the phone

2514
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,480
so i apologize i also have an

2515
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,560
authentication challenge ori steele with

2516
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,199
the transmute i work um

2517
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:08,400
in the

2518
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
digital identifier uh cryptographic

2519
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,280
assertion space in involved both in

2520
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,280
permission lists and permission

2521
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,040
blockchain technology

2522
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,600
um agree with the comments john made

2523
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,239
regarding where we see fraud and attacks

2524
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,080
in the space you know on the end points

2525
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,880
um certainly a concern certainly

2526
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,840
the the industry will solve for atomic

2527
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,560
swap blockchain interoperability between

2528
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,520
networks awkwardly by itself

2529
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,000
in absence of guidance from a group of

2530
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,760
folks who've organized to create you

2531
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,840
know clarity

2532
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,280
i don't know how much representation in

2533
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,199
my first time at ietf i'm not sure how

2534
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,679
much how many financial institutions

2535
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,520
come to these kinds of meetings to

2536
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,679
provide input but they are

2537
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:54,560
uh

2538
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,400
relevant to the questions you know on

2539
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,880
the screen um

2540
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,520
i i think my main interest in in this

2541
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,600
work is sort of seeing cyber physical

2542
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,080
supply chain cases so you mentioned some

2543
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,040
of the hybrid physical digital cases

2544
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,000
seeing

2545
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,760
folks coming together thinking more

2546
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,560
about those use cases is important to my

2547
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,560
business and you know we intend to

2548
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,639
deploy technologies that support

2549
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,639
providing physical supply chain

2550
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,400
traceability but also

2551
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,239
non-physical digital supply chain

2552
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,080
software supply chain use cases i think

2553
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:26,880
there's

2554
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,960
it's a good amount of overlap

2555
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,199
in some of the pieces that you've

2556
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,040
proposed i also think it is a

2557
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,760
challenging space and that scoping is

2558
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,080
even is very hard in this space um so

2559
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,400
i'm not sure how useful any of that is

2560
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,560
but i support the the attempt to create

2561
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,880
some order in the space

2562
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,840
thank you michael

2563
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,560
uh yes uh so michael prorock uh measure

2564
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,440
i o um definitely willing to participate

2565
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,440
in such a working group if it comes to

2566
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,480
play um you know once again though noted

2567
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,880
like here be dragons right and i think

2568
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,440
towards ori's note

2569
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,360
this stuff is going on like we see this

2570
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,600
actively i do a lot of work in you know

2571
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,679
everything from human trafficking to

2572
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:13,440
looking at forced labor and stuff like

2573
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,159
that and we see illicit transactions

2574
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:18,080
over these networks as well as

2575
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,080
occasionally legitimate transactions

2576
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,239
outside of the you know

2577
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,000
uh permission type stuff right in

2578
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,679
private network so it is something where

2579
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,920
we have to get some kind of structure

2580
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,400
and order on it if for no other reason

2581
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,480
than to understand what's going on and

2582
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,639
to enable some kind of regulation around

2583
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,560
this stuff so it's definitely something

2584
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,400
willing to participate in willing to

2585
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,080
make sure we're coding in accordance

2586
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,840
with standards should they emerge out of

2587
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,159
this stuff so it's uh so definite

2588
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,239
support understand the problem set but

2589
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,560
it's a dangerous area for sure for a lot

2590
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,159
of reasons so

2591
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:53,320
thank you

2592
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:58,400
[Laughter]

2593
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,840
sorry the last thing you said was the

2594
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,679
most important one i think so i guess

2595
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,520
i'd love to hear from ori and you and

2596
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,480
other people

2597
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,239
if the ietf produces a standardness in

2598
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:07,679
this space

2599
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,520
will that bring order or that could be

2600
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,520
actually xkcd-927

2601
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,880
and i don't know but i want to hear

2602
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,719
about it yeah well and more importantly

2603
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,719
do recognize for the proponents that

2604
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,400
when you bring stuff to the aetf it can

2605
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,920
change right you don't you know

2606
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,880
yeah and i'll follow up on that and eric

2607
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,880
and i think that's an excellent question

2608
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
and is part of my concern like i think

2609
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,560
the change actually is a good thing

2610
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,480
because i think bringing strong

2611
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,080
technical merit that's internet

2612
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,080
interested cross boundary that's

2613
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,639
important what i'm not sure on is how we

2614
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:40,159
actually defined the scope well enough

2615
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:41,679
to actually sit down and write about

2616
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,040
this

2617
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,920
i am

2618
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,000
not a hundred percent convinced that

2619
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,239
ietf putting a standard on this will be

2620
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,400
very helpful unless everyone actually

2621
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,159
follows the standard right or we see a

2622
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,719
large degree of adoption and this is one

2623
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,320
of the things that we see supply chain

2624
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320
wise and you know it's come up in other

2625
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,120
conversations at ietf uh just thinking

2626
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,440
about things like faa right an exchange

2627
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,600
of information around drones and other

2628
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,040
types of things

2629
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,320
when you start getting into these

2630
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,800
international boundary type questions

2631
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,840
sure it's great if everyone's respecting

2632
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,600
you know some north american model or

2633
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,920
north america plus europe etc but the

2634
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,760
world is much much bigger than that

2635
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,600
right and so if we're only seeing a

2636
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,760
partial buy-in from this

2637
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,719
that's concerning this goes a bit to is

2638
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,960
the ietf the right place to solve it and

2639
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,360
i am personally not 100 sure of that

2640
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,199
right there i think from the technical

2641
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,520
side and defining these protocols maybe

2642
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,960
but these network protocols for

2643
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,960
exchanging information in an asset type

2644
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,679
way they kind of exist right so

2645
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:43,199
that's a little bit of the concern i

2646
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,800
have is maybe this is more of a

2647
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,719
regulatory and a policy question maybe

2648
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:49,679
this is an iso thing etc and i'm not 100

2649
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,280
sure yet but i'm highly interested in

2650
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,960
the area the reason why it's itf it's

2651
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,840
it's kind of the home of

2652
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,679
interoperability and it's an open forum

2653
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,520
right so i don't have to pay so many

2654
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,639
million dollars to get some emails

2655
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,480
right and it's the specs are going to be

2656
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,800
you know open well and the paid aspect

2657
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,280
right is a highly concerning thing right

2658
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,880
so many of these things masquerade as

2659
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,480
standards or interop things and then in

2660
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,800
reality it's just pay to play

2661
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,639
uh we see that in agriculture all the

2662
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,560
time like oh yeah we've got such and

2663
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,800
such going on but in reality all you're

2664
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,719
doing is charging the farmer a bunch of

2665
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,280
money for very little value so if we can

2666
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,719
break that with a totally open

2667
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,560
non-proprietary standard cool but if

2668
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,159
that just defines something so people

2669
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,400
can masquerade and say they're doing

2670
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,080
interop that concerns me as well right

2671
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,760
just want to comment on where this is

2672
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,239
being used or applied so at least under

2673
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,040
the hyperledger umbrella the flagship uh

2674
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,560
there's a interoperability project

2675
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,239
called cactus and then we have our

2676
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,080
project under hyperlogic labs for weaver

2677
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,840
these are two most mature

2678
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,040
interoperability projects for

2679
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,080
permissioned

2680
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,520
uh blockchains really because that's the

2681
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,679
point of view we were coming from and uh

2682
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,280
within cactus you already have an

2683
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,960
implementation of the

2684
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,040
protocol that was talked about here

2685
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,159
and we were we have uh

2686
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,440
we've been building this concept of

2687
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,480
using gateways to communicate views as

2688
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,199
well as exchange assets or transfer

2689
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,199
assets and we intend to comply with

2690
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:12,800
whatever protocol is agreed upon for the

2691
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,360
workings so and in the recent past we've

2692
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,280
had basically every week

2693
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,840
we have a lot of meetings with uh

2694
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,280
cactus weaver

2695
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,440
with the eea with other various big

2696
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,199
players in the blockchain world

2697
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,480
and everybody is interested in that

2698
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,800
everybody wants to see it

2699
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,080
okay let's go on to the last couple of

2700
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,840
comments and then i'm going to bug roman

2701
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,560
and paul heads up so it's or still from

2702
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,719
transmute i'm queued to respond to eric

2703
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,040
uh i think you'd know better than i

2704
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,800
would er

2705
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,600
how the ietf might handle a situation

2706
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,080
like like this this proposal

2707
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,560
um the only thing i can say is that

2708
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,280
given the nature of the problem i think

2709
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,840
engagement international engagement from

2710
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,600
regulators you know banks financial

2711
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,400
institutions and technology developers

2712
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,560
would all be critical and it should be

2713
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,560
observable that they're there to

2714
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,199
participate in the work and that

2715
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,800
if those constituents are there and

2716
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,480
they're engaged they're contributing to

2717
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,840
the work and their contributions are

2718
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,800
visible

2719
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,639
i believe the ietf can produce

2720
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:16,560
interoperable standards that address the

2721
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,679
financial

2722
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,520
industry's needs for

2723
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,000
transport protocols

2724
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,480
however i'm not i'm not sure we're fully

2725
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,000
seeing them

2726
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,080
you know enough of them them here today

2727
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,159
i don't know what the criteria for

2728
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,400
observing the presence of

2729
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,280
those kinds of entities but i think

2730
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,199
right seeing regulators stepping up to

2731
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,960
the mic you know saying things like you

2732
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,000
know we'd like to we'd like to

2733
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,679
participate we'd like to comment we'd

2734
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,199
like to see

2735
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,280
you know my naive perspective on it as i

2736
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,960
would like to see their their comments

2737
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,440
on the proposal

2738
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,960
hi it's ducard i've got lots of

2739
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,360
different affiliations but for this time

2740
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,719
i'm going to wear the one that will

2741
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,400
paint a target on my back in this

2742
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,080
audience

2743
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,080
a little start-up called quotidian

2744
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,679
engineering and development which is

2745
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,440
explicitly a distributed ledger

2746
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,920
technology startup

2747
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,960
um

2748
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,040
i've been involved since the days of the

2749
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,920
cypherpunks in 1993.

2750
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,880
um

2751
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,400
i think before

2752
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,119
this work can um

2753
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,280
effectively be addressed oh okay use

2754
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,600
case um the first use case that i was

2755
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,320
involved in is i have the the sad honor

2756
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,159
of consuming the most expensive bag of

2757
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,400
popcorn in history which i bought with

2758
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,000
bitcoin from a vending machine that was

2759
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,679
prototyped by one of my co-inventors

2760
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,639
my use case here is

2761
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,080
in publicly in a non-repudiatable way

2762
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,080
recording at the stations of properties

2763
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,239
of software distributions

2764
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,639
so i think that's a valid use case for

2765
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,960
blockchains but anyway to see this

2766
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,040
address

2767
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,040
to see this to see this addressed in the

2768
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,159
itf

2769
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,000
we have to first off take on the

2770
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,920
visceral response that it generates

2771
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,639
amongst ietfers if you say blockchain

2772
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,480
you just painted a big honking target on

2773
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,639
yourself and part of that is legitimate

2774
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,119
because proof of work is evil okay

2775
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,199
but um proof of scope i'm not sure is

2776
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,880
the answer uh proof of stake i'm not

2777
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,199
sure is is uh you know the answer either

2778
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,239
right

2779
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,159
we need to think about why is it that

2780
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,320
blockchain technology arrives you know

2781
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,000
causes such a visceral response in

2782
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,400
ietfers and unless we

2783
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,679
address that right this community is not

2784
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,760
going to be very welcoming to to this

2785
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,960
kind of work

2786
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,239
so so let me claim this famous coinage

2787
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,800
bitcoin turns very good engineers into

2788
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,000
very light lousy speculators

2789
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,960
that's tm tm thomas all right so so no

2790
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,400
absolutely agree

2791
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,719
this technology is here to stay in

2792
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,480
some form another it's going to evolve

2793
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,480
and i believe the itf needs to step to

2794
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,480
the plate and say yeah we can address

2795
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,719
some parts of this intro problem

2796
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,800
at the very minimum and it's almost like

2797
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,800
well if if the itf is not going to do it

2798
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,719
who else is going to do it because each

2799
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,719
of these you know communities

2800
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,560
you know they're still stuck on like

2801
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,480
designing their own internal networks

2802
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,119
and basically promoting their own tokens

2803
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:16,800
okay and this is you know this is back

2804
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,880
with the you know expected engineers the

2805
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,480
speculators right

2806
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,639
so so that's why we came to the itf

2807
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:23,840
because i think this is the home of

2808
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,920
interop i've been telling now just to

2809
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,199
give you a picture there's a whole

2810
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:28,800
generation of

2811
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,679
under

2812
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,159
i don't know 25s who don't know

2813
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,239
the itf produced tcp ip tls ipsec x509

2814
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,679
they've like never heard of the itf

2815
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:38,719
before

2816
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:41,600
and this is a problem not not for me

2817
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,280
it's like everybody and i think this is

2818
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,600
a good this this other kind of work is a

2819
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,760
good entryway but people say well yeah

2820
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,199
we've got the engineering know-how we

2821
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,040
can do it too and we'll do it better

2822
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,239
with good design engineering principles

2823
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,920
all right thank you all i will say that

2824
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,679
the right magic words are merkle trees

2825
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,400
etf has used merkel trees a lot

2826
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,880
you have to couch it properly

2827
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,080
uh

2828
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,080
roman and paul so i have 20 minutes left

2829
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,239
we have some i think options about where

2830
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,000
where what would be most useful to you

2831
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,400
two to make a decision in the long run

2832
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,880
we can start doing polling now or you

2833
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,560
know next up technically on the agenda

2834
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,800
was a charter discussion but it feels

2835
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,760
like we might want to preempt that with

2836
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,360
usability and other stuff so we'll let

2837
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,520
them confer and they're developed to

2838
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,320
markle tree's head

2839
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,159
so give us one minute while we pause for

2840
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,000
a moment i will note that i did pull up

2841
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,880
some of the um

2842
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,360
actually let me while they're thinking

2843
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,679
i will put up some of the proposed

2844
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,440
charter so you can read a couple of

2845
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,119
sentences while we're waiting

2846
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:47,679
david any chance i could make a comment

2847
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,719
while we're waiting go ahead thanks uh

2848
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,560
davidskenazi internet architecture

2849
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,920
enthusiast

2850
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,280
um

2851
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,080
so just to respond to some of the points

2852
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,080
here before um

2853
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,960
the the main question that i'm noodling

2854
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,679
on is whether the itf is the right place

2855
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:06,960
for this

2856
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,199
um because the itf has some advantages

2857
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,920
uh in that yeah it's free but you know

2858
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,280
so is github

2859
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,480
and it has some you know ipr policies

2860
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,719
which are great um

2861
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:21,440
and

2862
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,679
it has some credibility

2863
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:28,000
um but then the question is

2864
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,960
are we

2865
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,080
is

2866
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,679
like like we were saying there seems to

2867
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,360
be some use cases that make sense but at

2868
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,199
the same time the optics of us enabling

2869
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,480
technologies that

2870
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,719
folks have concerns about

2871
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:46,400
uh could damage

2872
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,600
the credibility of the ietf and that is

2873
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,440
somewhat of a concern that is worth

2874
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,760
taking into consideration so

2875
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,560
i i don't really have a question for you

2876
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,719
it's just i think that should be part of

2877
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,719
our decision on whether we want to adopt

2878
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:01,920
this work

2879
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,800
on what the consequences would be

2880
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,880
uh long term

2881
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,080
you know the interesting thing there's

2882
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,600
also an enhancement to the credibility

2883
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,040
in some people's eyes too and how do you

2884
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,840
weigh those two things but

2885
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,840
yes point

2886
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,360
thank you dave

2887
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,920
uh if i can add to that comment um so

2888
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,639
i've been working with um blockchains

2889
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,080
for the past like

2890
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,480
five to six years and i've started with

2891
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,320
ethereum and bitcoin but then moved on

2892
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,679
to more refined you could say networks

2893
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,040
um and each of them is evolving on top

2894
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,360
of the past one so what if bitcoin was

2895
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,199
very you know

2896
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,920
disruptive but also destructive you have

2897
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,880
a theorem which you can take into a

2898
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,000
private consortium and build something

2899
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,840
amazing with it without any of the

2900
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,520
environmental concerns just because of

2901
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,760
how

2902
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,520
you know how capable the technology is

2903
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,119
to adapt but

2904
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,719
the problem with these networks

2905
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,880
developing on them i had to learn like

2906
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,960
you know 10 different apis to be able to

2907
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,560
interact with all of these

2908
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,600
and

2909
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,679
none of them have any like standards

2910
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,840
between each other it's very hard to

2911
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,719
take

2912
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,480
what you learn from one network and sort

2913
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,719
of say okay this is similar to to this

2914
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,000
other one

2915
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,280
and the problem that all of these

2916
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,400
networks face is that they sort of

2917
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,400
especially the permissionless ones they

2918
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,840
sort of like

2919
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,360
have this

2920
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,520
ego that it should be decentralized

2921
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,280
there's no governing

2922
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,239
authority in this um blockchain space

2923
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,719
especially and also in networks so i

2924
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,840
think a group like ietf which is you

2925
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,360
know worldwide and um has this sort of

2926
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,800
um

2927
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,119
it's not you know a single a single

2928
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,360
entity it's multiple companies coming

2929
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,440
together this would be like a perfect

2930
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,320
use case i think um for an institution

2931
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,840
like this an organization like this

2932
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,280
yeah thank you all right uh

2933
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,040
roman are you records let me let me

2934
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,800
table you for one second see if you guys

2935
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:01,440
are

2936
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,880
done okay

2937
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,840
i'm gonna let them jump

2938
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,960
first answer their questions yeah

2939
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,040
fallout city

2940
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,679
so the questions can we talk a bit like

2941
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:12,960
like a couple of minutes about the

2942
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,840
charter and and see if if that gives us

2943
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,080
more clarity about i'm answering one of

2944
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,159
the first two questions of the if the

2945
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,000
buff about whether this is the right

2946
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,199
place and whether there's a problem we

2947
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,719
could solve yep as i said that was

2948
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,400
actually my next plan so colin did you

2949
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,559
have

2950
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,280
i'll make this really brief i i think

2951
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,840
the itf should be very hesitant about

2952
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,520
not doing work because of a value

2953
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,119
judgment about how it'll be used a ton

2954
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,960
of the use cases i heard were permission

2955
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,480
block change which probably have very

2956
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,159
low energy impact on the world obviously

2957
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,440
there's some use cases that very high

2958
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,520
energy impact but if we start going down

2959
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,920
that path there is no into it and you

2960
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,639
know

2961
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,239
it sure is a good thing we didn't invent

2962
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,760
the shaw hash i mean you know think

2963
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:55,520
about that for a second right um so i i

2964
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,040
just i really think that that's a

2965
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,199
slippery slope that we have no way as an

2966
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,360
organization of picking the right place

2967
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,760
to be down that slippery slope so i

2968
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,639
i

2969
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,719
i i expect individuals to decide whether

2970
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,320
they contribute and work in the area or

2971
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
not based on their own decision point

2972
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,320
about that but i don't think that that

2973
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,000
is one of our criteria for choosing

2974
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,080
working groups particularly and yeah we

2975
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,440
should agree with david completely we

2976
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,480
should think about that maybe i'm

2977
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,679
totally wrong

2978
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,440
but my point of view is that's probably

2979
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,440
not that's a very dangerous criteria for

2980
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,960
us to go down because tons of our stuff

2981
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,960
is used for all kinds of off military

2982
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,480
operations and everything else right

2983
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,320
like you look at what our stuff is used

2984
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,360
for

2985
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,000
you get a much more dicey than you think

2986
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,080
i agree all right so in order to dive

2987
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,840
down the scope thing a little bit i have

2988
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,360
i do have a couple of slides on the

2989
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
draft scope that was floated around by

2990
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,880
proponents and on the mailing list and

2991
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,840
um so i'm going to let you read those

2992
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,920
but basically you know

2993
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,000
one of the things is that it is supposed

2994
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
to you know make use of existing ihf

2995
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,280
technologies that you know we are

2996
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,679
familiar with like tls and json and

2997
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,600
object containers and things like that

2998
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,040
as well as encryption protocols and

2999
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,880
digital certificates and other stuff

3000
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,360
um echo one sec

3001
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,040
although the immediate focus is on

3002
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,280
unidirectional they have scoped it down

3003
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,719
to be unidirectional but i think even

3004
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,239
some of their examples sort of pointed

3005
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,560
toward the bi-directional needs again

3006
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,719
that was scoping it to get it down to a

3007
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,719
single place

3008
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,480
with respect to

3009
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,040
what is the scope right so api endpoint

3010
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,239
definitions

3011
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:23,679
they didn't define that super well in

3012
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,280
the in the presentations but it is in

3013
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,199
the documents in terms of

3014
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,280
uh the gateways have an api to interact

3015
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,400
between the gateways and there's a

3016
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,360
gateway api inside that is sort of at

3017
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,360
the outer scope side uh the resource

3018
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,520
identifiers you know as people noted

3019
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,719
that may

3020
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,239
people may want to change how the

3021
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,080
identifier actually looks that's for the

3022
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,360
working group to do

3023
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,880
the message flows and payloads again

3024
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,560
those are very high level presentations

3025
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,080
that the documentation is actually quite

3026
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,280
a bit longer

3027
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,560
and then of course you know there's some

3028
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,199
terminology work and

3029
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,920
uh the milestones that were listed were

3030
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,679
you know a use cases document sounds

3031
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,199
like six months because they already

3032
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:01,360
have done a lot of work in that space

3033
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,920
um for anybody that is going to do

3034
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,080
deployments or would consider it i think

3035
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,800
you know the proponents would love your

3036
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
particular use cases spelled out too so

3037
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
that we can make that stronger

3038
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,320
uh there's an architecture document and

3039
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,320
a protocol document

3040
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,400
that is the

3041
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,080
sort of the charter and in a nutshell

3042
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,280
there's some background stuff that i

3043
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,080
skipped over here

3044
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,639
and so one of my questions is

3045
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,960
is this too small right because i think

3046
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,760
you in particular very much hinted that

3047
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,080
the the the scope is so small that you

3048
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,360
can't wrap your head around it because

3049
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,800
you need the bigger picture i was hoping

3050
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,119
to go back to the first line

3051
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:43,380
uh

3052
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:45,760
[Music]

3053
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,719
that one

3054
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,719
no the ones the ones that said

3055
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,840
verifiable asset transfer i believe

3056
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,000
uh

3057
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,440
blah blah blah

3058
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,840
okay like can you start me get to start

3059
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,880
and just go forward and then i'll tell

3060
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,280
you when to stop

3061
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,679
no

3062
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,440
no you can't because there's definitely

3063
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,400
some thoughts in this test dude

3064
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,040
i didn't see anything that said

3065
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,480
verifiable asset transfer

3066
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:24,880
by third parties

3067
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,440
could be um

3068
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,639
but as well i just want to look at that

3069
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,080
slide for a minute first of all these

3070
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,520
numbers are fantasy can we just pretend

3071
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,080
like 12 months is like like banana pants

3072
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,760
like we all know that right

3073
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,360
um

3074
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,719
um

3075
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,719
well slide one baby

3076
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,880
this is like eight

3077
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,600
that's like one yeah two

3078
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,199
three

3079
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,520
hundred three

3080
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,199
um

3081
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,360
four

3082
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,199
fantastic four pages this is why i watch

3083
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,000
okay

3084
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,320
um

3085
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,480
i don't know what this means

3086
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,679
and this is actually really important i

3087
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:02,880
i just think i'm nitpicking but it's

3088
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,600
really important because one of the key

3089
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,840
um descriptions uh this goes to the

3090
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,000
scope of the question is one of the key

3091
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,800
to not descriptions of the dlts is by

3092
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,480
double spending protection

3093
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,960
and so is double spending protection in

3094
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,119
scope or out of scope for this problem

3095
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,480
so so

3096
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:21,840
if if

3097
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,560
if the asset properties are fulfilled

3098
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,239
then you should not have double spending

3099
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:30,159
that's the way we talk about acidity

3100
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:32,159
acid versus double i don't think that's

3101
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,000
correct because you have three networks

3102
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,760
a b and c

3103
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:36,880
and

3104
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,119
what stops what stops a

3105
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,119
from allegedly transferring to b and

3106
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,400
then to c

3107
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,080
so so this is why you have gateways and

3108
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,599
the gateways of the commitment and you

3109
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,280
have the legal behind okay but then

3110
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,400
that's not third party very far but

3111
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,239
that's my point

3112
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:51,840
so third party means that if there's any

3113
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,040
disputes

3114
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,639
a lawyer can come in and say show me

3115
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,000
evidence on your network showing

3116
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,320
evidence on network two and we'll we'll

3117
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,679
resolve this

3118
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,520
this this is why it has to be verifiable

3119
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,480
by by a human being if there's a dispute

3120
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,760
okay this is gonna require some more

3121
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,440
fleshing out here because

3122
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,040
um

3123
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:12,239
okay um well yes so um i i do think this

3124
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:15,199
is too small um uh but i think i've said

3125
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,719
much that i can say about that

3126
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,159
um

3127
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,159
one of the interesting things to me is

3128
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:20,880
that

3129
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,119
you know we've

3130
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:24,880
yeah i'll let you go ahead and i'll

3131
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,480
rephrase

3132
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,719
or steal from transmute my understanding

3133
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,000
is it's sort of

3134
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,480
attempting to solve for the double spend

3135
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,800
problem through a legal enforcement

3136
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,239
mechanism

3137
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,440
as i read it today fair enough so maybe

3138
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,280
the clutter fight that's why it's a

3139
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,800
proposed data that's fine this is good

3140
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,599
input by the way yeah

3141
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,239
okay so

3142
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,360
right now

3143
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,280
the scope of work and the sort of the

3144
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,040
charter these are the two important

3145
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,639
things right this is what will be done

3146
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,000
and then there's the three deliverables

3147
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,679
i think the initial question before we

3148
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,599
ask you know the standard buff questions

3149
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:10,400
is

3150
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,080
is there anything that should be added

3151
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,080
or removed

3152
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,920
you know from these two of the most

3153
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,400
important lists and and you know text

3154
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,080
about is the background description

3155
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,679
right and things like that is certainly

3156
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,440
subject to debate i'll note that you

3157
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,599
know the one oddity for me in this whole

3158
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:26,960
endeavor

3159
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,639
is that we do have a case of a

3160
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:33,040
a potential ietf protocol that has some

3161
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,639
integrated legal frameworks that are

3162
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,159
sort of necessary for the protocol to

3163
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,840
work well i actually don't think this is

3164
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,920
the only case where that might be but i

3165
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,360
was struggling to find the other ones i

3166
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,199
think the

3167
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:44,159
um

3168
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,480
i can give you another example so x509

3169
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,560
certs issued by a ca there's a there's a

3170
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,800
long csp that's it's a legal document

3171
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,520
it's got warranties and if the ca

3172
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,760
screws up you sue the ca that's illegal

3173
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,280
if you send in the lawyers i mean that's

3174
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,280
what they do in the real world

3175
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,560
and that was that was the one that i

3176
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,840
think was most tangential to me

3177
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,920
especially with um

3178
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,520
proof of

3179
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,239
ca's issuing so go ahead michael

3180
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:11,280
yeah quick clarifying question you know

3181
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,520
should some existing thing already

3182
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,599
exists for one of these items i mean is

3183
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:17,360
it a potential outcome to just say nope

3184
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,560
we're gonna go point at that other

3185
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,080
standard and you hinted that with the

3186
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,960
terminology and if i didn't see mr and

3187
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,360
iso on there for those things i'd be

3188
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,199
really worried about yeah we actually

3189
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,400
want more

3190
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,040
please yes

3191
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,840
yeah i think the proponents are very

3192
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,320
open to help

3193
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,320
all right so i don't see any more uh

3194
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,400
questions which brings us to

3195
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,159
uh given our understanding of the

3196
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,000
problem space today and giving our

3197
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,239
understanding of the proposed scope and

3198
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,920
deliverables

3199
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,920
uh we should go back to ask sort of the

3200
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,159
more standard you know buff questions

3201
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,480
i think the first is

3202
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,719
what is the sense of the room

3203
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:07,599
and i guess i should use the hands tool

3204
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:10,239
in order to

3205
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:13,520
show of hands tool so

3206
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,840
uh let me live right you guys won't be

3207
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,840
able to see it but i'll read it as i'm

3208
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,960
typing

3209
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,000
is the

3210
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,360
problem

3211
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,800
space

3212
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,280
well understood

3213
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,239
is that a sufficient one any objections

3214
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:30,400
to that wording we're good at objections

3215
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,199
all right

3216
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,119
so i'm going to start the session please

3217
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,880
raise your hand if the problem space is

3218
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,599
well understood do not raise your hand

3219
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:41,119
if the problem space is not

3220
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:42,080
um

3221
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,280
if you're not going to use the tool

3222
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,880
you're welcome to raise your hand in the

3223
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,119
room if you think the problem space is

3224
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,119
well understood

3225
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:51,199
questions

3226
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,840
well understood by this room or well

3227
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,920
understood in the world

3228
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,320
this room

3229
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,950
okay the world

3230
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:05,679
[Laughter]

3231
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,159
we're still seeing a few more votes

3232
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:11,920
creep in but uh it's looking pretty

3233
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,159
clear at this point

3234
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,239
i only just had a computer on my machine

3235
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,560
so it might be

3236
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,840
all right so uh for the note taker we

3237
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,239
have 11 hands raised and 34 not raised

3238
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:28,400
which indicates that the problem space

3239
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,480
35 not raised

3240
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,480
the problem space is not super well

3241
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,960
understood

3242
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,320
which does not mean that the work

3243
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,920
couldn't happen but it does make it more

3244
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,000
challenging if we don't uh come to

3245
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,480
agreement on what the problem space

3246
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,920
actually is

3247
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,960
um

3248
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,800
i think that the other big one that came

3249
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,960
out of this discussion is

3250
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,719
is the ietf

3251
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:52,560
the right

3252
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,080
standards

3253
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,760
body to take on this work

3254
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,320
so i will start that queue

3255
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,440
um i recognize i would have a hard time

3256
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:09,239
answering this question myself

3257
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,199
i said

3258
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,050
i like watching people change your mind

3259
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:36,639
[Laughter]

3260
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,159
there's people that have switched back

3261
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,760
and forth

3262
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,920
well i keep clicking on the output for

3263
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,080
the result of the poll instead of the

3264
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,880
input

3265
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,060
phil i can't help you

3266
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:52,080
[Laughter]

3267
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,000
all right uh i think we'll call that

3268
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,159
good so for the note taker that was 24

3269
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:58,480
hands raised and 20 knot rays with a

3270
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,239
slight leaning toward actually the ietf

3271
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,920
might be the right place to actually

3272
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,920
conduct this work

3273
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:06,239
um

3274
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:08,400
25 to 19

3275
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,440
last minute change okay

3276
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:13,119
the queue has been cut

3277
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:14,800
so the next

3278
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:19,040
uh question i think would be

3279
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,320
recognizing that we don't agree

3280
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,000
necessarily the problem space is well

3281
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,360
defined this next question is going to

3282
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,520
be hard to answer but it is still sort

3283
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,760
of the right next question which is

3284
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,679
is the scope

3285
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,080
of the proposed

3286
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,080
charter

3287
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:48,040
[Laughter]

3288
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:52,159
questions live it's good fun

3289
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,639
is the scope of the proposed charter i

3290
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:55,840
don't want to say sufficient i don't

3291
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,199
want to say too small or too you know it

3292
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:58,480
really means two questions but i didn't

3293
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:01,759
want to do that correct um

3294
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,119
viable sufficient to start a working

3295
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:08,119
group

3296
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,719
yeah

3297
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,080
the submission started working group

3298
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,119
oh they're in the meat echo room so you

3299
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:26,639
have to you have to go in

3300
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:28,960
either you can do it on your phone you

3301
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,800
can you can go enter the medical room on

3302
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,400
your phone using the qr code that was up

3303
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,400
for there's a link

3304
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,920
you can also do it on a computer and it

3305
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:39,320
gives you the full

3306
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,760
all right that's looking pretty stable

3307
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:55,199
so that is 13 raised their hands and 32

3308
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:58,559
did not raise their hands

3309
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:04,800
so that to me sees that there is

3310
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,320
probably a scope question that would

3311
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,840
require some uh work with the

3312
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,840
the ads in order to

3313
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,840
come up with a scope that was actually

3314
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,400
better or possibly another buff

3315
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,000
roman and paul what other questions

3316
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,840
would you like to have answered

3317
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,239
so it seems like we need some more

3318
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:36,080
discussion uh

3319
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,560
and maybe another above or

3320
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,639
maybe some more communication between

3321
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:42,000
the parties

3322
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,760
before we move on um

3323
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,520
does that seem

3324
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,520
it does so i mean the one thing to to

3325
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,920
recognize is um i had the mailing list

3326
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,920
up there earlier it's standard ietf

3327
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,560
mailing list mailman sat if you want to

3328
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,760
get involved and be part of the

3329
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,920
discussions i suspect that the authors

3330
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,599
have gotten a lot of good feedback today

3331
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:03,599
regardless of the outcome of the boss

3332
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:06,080
and whether a working group is formed

3333
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,760
you can see where some of the holes in

3334
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,119
terms of

3335
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,199
knowledge that that people need in order

3336
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:14,560
to find it a tractable problem but

3337
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,320
the interesting thing to me is is what's

3338
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,599
the right scope because some people

3339
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,040
would want more some people would want

3340
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,320
less and

3341
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,760
that that's always the hard line to

3342
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,080
watch

3343
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,679
yeah i think i agree what you're saying

3344
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:28,800
okay

3345
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,800
all right so i think with that uh we

3346
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,960
will declare this buff done and uh thank

3347
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,639
you to the presenters for bringing your

3348
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:37,199
problem space to us and it's an

3349
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:41,000
interesting one so

3350
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:49,159
that is a great question um

3351
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,360
yes

3352
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:17,639
okay

3353
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:48,599
okay

3354
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,159
there's a

3355
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:24,040
much of them
