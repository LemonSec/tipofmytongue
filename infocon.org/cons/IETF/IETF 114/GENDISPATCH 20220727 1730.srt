by participating here you are agreeing

51
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
to the ietf policies and procedures if

52
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
you do not know them

53

please go review them there's a list of

54
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
bcps at the bottom of this slide

55
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
you need to be aware that by

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,479
participating there are lots of rules

57
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
regarding

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
patents and patent applications

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,759
that are

60
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,639
controlled or owned by you or your

61
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,479
sponsor and you're going to have to

62
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
disclose such patents if those become an

63
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,600
issue

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
if you don't want to do that you should

65
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
probably not participate

66
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,560

um gen dispatch recommends next steps

136

for new work we do not adopt drafts

137
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,960
ourself

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
we do not do work on drafts in this room

139
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
except to discuss them slightly so we

140
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,400
understand how to dispatch them the

141
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
possible outcomes include directing to

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
an existing working group proposing a

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
new focused working group asking for ad

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
sponsorship if the ad in question is

145
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,840
willing and able

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
additional discussion or community

147
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
development

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
might be required and we might ask for

149
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
that before further dispatch

150
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
or we might decide to dispatch to the

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,159
trash can as in the ietf should not take

152

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
refresh oh well

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
we'll get there

176
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
um first well that was our

177
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
administrative part

178
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
lars is going to talk to updating the

179
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
dow

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
then we're going to have some discussion

181
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
about namco eligibility but martin won't

182
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
be doing that i will

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
uh because

184
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,720
there have been some changes afoot even

185
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
this week on that topic

186
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
and then we'll have a conclusion and

187
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
summarize what we need to summarize

188
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
any further things if there is time at

189
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
the end obviously we'll have other

190
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
business if people want to bring it up

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
are there any agenda bashes that need to

192
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
happen

193
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
the stairs and your computer screens are

194
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
delightful um then the next step will be

195
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,760
let me get lars's slides up

196
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
there we go just tell me when to move to

197
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
the next one

198
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
or actually you can do that from your

199
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
phone can't you

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,399
but i could do it that's fine

201
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
this was off now it's on uh my name is

202
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
lars eggert and uh i'm the itf germany

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
general area id and i have two topics um

204
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,600
first of one is uh

205
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
how we're going to go about updating the

206
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
dao in the future the dial used to be an

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,760
rfc can you go next slide

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
the tahoe

209
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,959
so the screen down here has a curtain

210
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
that makes you can't read the corners

211
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
which is kind of cute um

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
so the the dao was published as an rfc

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,399
up until

214
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,920
2006 i guess

215
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,240
um there have been five thank you five

216
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
revisions

217
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
um six revisions at a time

218
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
and then we decided that that was too

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,079
heavy way to process

220
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,360
and instead we decided we're going to

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
publish it as a web page and we

222
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,680
published rfc 6722 to describe how we're

223
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
going to do that and

224
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
the intent was to have more rapid

225
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
updates to the dao

226
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,640
that

227
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
started out well in 2012 we had three

228
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,760
revisions

229
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
but then it sort of slowed again

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
and by now we've had done two more

231
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,079
so if you look at the the counts

232
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,880
it's not significantly um improved our

233
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
rate of updates to the dao

234
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
and so this is an opportunity for a

235
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,279
different process i think um

236
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,480
but it's also the opportunity for a

237
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
broader discussion about maybe what do

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
we want the dow to be

239
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,000
next slide

240
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,320
so there's a bunch of processes with um

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
what 6722 says uh

242
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
we should do and i'm gonna i put them in

243
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
an email a while ago i'm gonna list them

244
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
here but first

245
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
although the dao is published as a web

246
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,639
page now revisions still require isg

247
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
approval

248
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,480
and the isg reviews and approves many

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
documents

250
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,519
and we use the data tracker for that but

251
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,720
the dollar revisions don't live in the

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
data tracker so they're really hard to

253
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
track

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and approve in a timely manner if you

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
overload it like we all are

256
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
um

257
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
and it would be overkill i think to add

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
bespoke tooling to the data tracker just

259
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,800
to deal with our revisions

260
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
um and craig guy's questions for

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
community is does the isg really need to

262
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
review these dollar revisions would it

263
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
be better or easier if somebody else did

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
so

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
we'll see next

266
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
slide

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
another problem is that old data

268
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
revisions are still available as rfcs

269
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
because we never change them and

270
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
unpublish them and that means they get

271
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
indexed by search engines and people

272
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
cite them

273
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
because people like to cite proper

274
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,680
documents over web pages especially like

275
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
when they write um articles and uh

276
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
things and so you know these old

277
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,279
revisions don't seem to die

278
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
which is a little bit of a problem

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
because the contents of the tower change

280
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,839
next

281
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,720
slide then

282
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,639
rfc 6722

283
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
is pretty prescriptive you probably

284
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
can't read this but there's

285
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
some text in section two that sort of

286
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
talks about the specific urls where the

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
tile lives and revisions that are under

288
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
review shall live

289
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,959
it has a process that again includes

290
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
some urls

291
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
and instructs the isg exactly how it

292
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
needs to sort of go about

293
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,920
publishing updates

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,279
and then it also talks about how you

295
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
archive the dao and again it's the url

296
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
scheme so it seems

297
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
it might have made sense at the time we

298
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
published this 10 years ago

299
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
these days this sort of restricts us a

300
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
little bit in how we run the web front

301
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
end so um

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
we might want to change that and give

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,760
the operations people a bit more

304
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,519
flexibility

305
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
next slide

306
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
so personal view uh for what we could do

307
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
here right and

308
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,839
basically there's sort of two broad

309
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,839
categories in my mind if there's a

310
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,040
desire

311
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
that the isg continue review

312
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
dar revisions

313
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
it would be awfully nice if we could

314
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
like publish them as rfcs again so we

315
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
can use the regular process in the data

316
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
tracker to

317
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,600
manage that review and approval

318
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
if we decide that we want to do

319
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,279
something else not to require the isg to

320
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,399
approve these

321
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,839
i don't really care what we do but it

322
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
gives us a lot more options

323
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
right and that's basically where i'm

324
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,560
going to stop

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,000
to have a discussion thank you

326
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
stephan

327
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
stephen wenger my first observation is

328
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
that these two things are

329
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
not mutually exclusive for example you

330
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
could decide that every three years you

331
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
publish an rc perhaps even on a fixed

332
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
schedule

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
and that rfc could say oh and by the way

334
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,120
for updates go to this webpage

335
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
document enthusiast i guess

336
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
um

337
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,360
so first point yes i'm somewhat

338
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,560
horrified to see in 2021 http only urls

339
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,839
like

340
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,959
some point

341
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,240
like

342
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
yeah my browser is about to stop

343
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
allowing those at some point so yeah

344
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
that's being this prescriptive makes

345
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,800
absolutely no sense in this day and age

346
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
so i fully agree with you lars that's

347
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,160
some that doesn't need to be this

348
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
strictly specified

349
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,639
like

350
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
no one's gonna actually follow you or

351
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,920
like no one discovers the dao by looking

352
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
at an rc that tells you what the process

353
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,560
for the dao is if someone's doing that

354
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
they're not the target audience of the

355
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
dao

356
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
um

357
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
but then my second point is

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
on this discoverability and target

359
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,639
audience

360
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,759
i kind of think of the dao as the

361
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,480
decodering of the itf

362
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
the

363
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
read this and you'll understand what the

364
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,240
hell all these words mean and why these

365
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
people are so strange

366
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
but

367
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,279
then i'm very confused because i don't

368
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
know much about taoism and

369
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,680
why is our decoder ring

370
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
has a name that needs to be decoded

371
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
itself it would be nice if we had this

372
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
like

373
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,959
front and center on with a name that is

374
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
useful that people can understand what

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
it is i know that the dao was a cute

376
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
name back in the day but if our goal of

377
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
this document is to help newcomers

378
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,240
understand how we are maybe a rename

379
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
could be useful

380
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
barry lieber is up this is barry lieber

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,679
and my uh now after david's uh comment

382
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
mine can be very short closer to the mic

383
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
please now that uh david has spoken mine

384
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
can be very short i agree with that last

385
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,079
bit of david's that we should be

386
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
targeting this to

387
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
beginners at the ietf and focus it

388
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,199
differently

389
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
jim reed

390
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
thank you very much pete jim reads

391
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,919
i think we need to keep publishing this

392
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
as an rfc um because as you said lars

393
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
this is how people make reference to the

394
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
style of documents and so on i think it

395
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,679
would be a key if we ended up having

396
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
that being referenced through a url or

397
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
something like that i'm also now keen on

398
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
the idea of sticking stuff in github as

399
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
far as the review process is concerned i

400
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
agree an ieg review is overkill so i

401
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,640
would maybe suggest that the chair of

402
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
the ietf does that that's why you get

403
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
the big bucks isn't it

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
i didn't catch the last part is that the

405
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,640
id the itf chair could do the review on

406
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
their own that's why you get the big

407
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
bucks

408
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,600
so if it's if it's supposed to be in rfc

409
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
on the itf stream it it needs to go

410
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
through isg approval there's no other

411
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,679
way to publish rfcs on the idea stream

412
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,960
we decided

413
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
long ago that that's the way we're going

414
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
to do it

415
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
karen o'donoghue

416
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
just a quick reference on

417
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
discoverability

418
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
it's on the newcomers page it goes out

419
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,679
in email to all of the newscomers and

420
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,480
it's in the newcomers tutorial so it is

421
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
actually sent to newcomers

422
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,360
for what that's worth

423
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,799
uh rob welton you're next in line

424
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,880
robertson cisco so i don't think the ice

425
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
team needs to get close to the mic i i

426
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,320
don't think the isg needs to review

427
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,760
something that's overkill i would

428
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,919
personally like to see this on github

429
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
and publish just as a web page and i

430
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,520
think it's again the comments that barry

431
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,039
and others have made that the focus of

432
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,160
this should be to newcomers and i think

433
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
trying to target this or even a

434
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
collection of pages more towards that is

435
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
better i i find this hard to read i

436
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
didn't read all this when i came to the

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
itf and i've managed i know i know other

438
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,760
people have done the same thing

439
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,840
all right uh ecker you're next yeah i

440
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
guess i'd like to disentangle two

441
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
questions um one what we have to apply

442
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
to newcomers and two what the fate of

443
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
this artifact ought to be

444
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,559
um this artifact is

445
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
not appropriate for the current era let

446
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
me just put it that way like

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
when people come

448
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,960
people the way people come to

449
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
organizations now is they expect to have

450
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
information presented in a layered

451
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
format with the initial page where the

452
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
initial page that is easy to read and

453
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,840
then you can go dive deeper and that's

454
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
like how the web works now and so like

455
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,360
the idea that they're going to wade

456
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
through like pages and pages of like

457
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
asking narrative with you know with like

458
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
history of like the arcane arcana the

459
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
itf that they don't need to understand

460
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
to do anything at all like many finances

461
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
and knitters is like i understand people

462
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
are attached to our history and like for

463
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
the dow to continue to like document

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
those historical arcana and our history

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
like it's a fantastic is like it's like

466
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
good i've read john peterson's books on

467
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
dnd i enjoy them this can serve that

468
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
same purpose but for the purpose of

469
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,159
bringing in newcomers you need something

470
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
else and

471
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
so i'd like to decouple those two

472
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,640
questions i think it's fine for the dow

473
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,159
to continue to be

474
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,039
and

475
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,240
some something that is published by

476
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
publishers in rfc and that is reviewed

477
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
by isg and people who think that that

478
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
kind of history is important or attached

479
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
to it and feel that feel like that's an

480
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,840
important thing to work on should

481
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
continue to do so but we should produce

482
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
a separate set of artifacts which are

483
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
targeted at newcomers that bring them to

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,159
speed quickly and the way that people

485
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,640
now expect and like that is web pages

486
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,799
it's videos it's tutorials it's like all

487
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,320
the material you go if you like if you

488
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
want to learn how to use like you know

489
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
if you want to learn how to like deploy

490
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
something on cloudflare or fastly like

491
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
that or like learn how to write node

492
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
code right there's like tutorials you

493
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,840
can read that and that's the kind of

494
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,679
stuff material you need and we should

495
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,880
like engage people on how to write the

496
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
material and we should put it out on our

497
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,320
website

498
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
thanks uh don easley you're up

499
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
uh hi donal he's like from uh future way

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,240
technologies i guess i wanted to

501
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,799
endorse at least periodic

502
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,679
publication as an rfc and uh

503
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,600
i don't know i'm fine with reorganizing

504
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
things so that it's more top-down and

505
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
has less

506
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
discursive stuff throughout but more of

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
the stuff you need most urgently near

508
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,840
the beginning of the document and stuff

509
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,799
and

510
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,280
uh things like that but i i'm in favor

511
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
of uh

512
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,120
solid uh permanent written documentation

513
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
and uh maybe uh people who are

514
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
are likely to be successful in the itf

515
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,480
can't absorb that kind of stuff

516
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
so hang on i've got a follow-up question

517
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
to you and there was somebody else at

518
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
the same idea so

519
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,559
can we talk a little bit how that would

520
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,000
work in practice right so if you'd like

521
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
say to do an rfc every three years would

522
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
we then in the meantime allow the

523
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,679
editors to push things to the web page

524
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
without review by the isg and then

525
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
after three years the isu reviews and

526
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,360
what if whatever the isg disagrees and

527
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,039
hopefully after three years the ietf

528
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,960
reviews uh

529
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
going through the isg but uh

530
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,960
i i think that uh

531
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
maybe this working group review i don't

532
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
know somebody else can review in the

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
meantime but

534
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,159
dispatch isn't chartered for that yeah

535
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,280
yeah well you can always change that but

536
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
i'm not gonna we will do nothing except

537
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
this one thing

538
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
or a new working group

539
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
thanks don

540
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
uh dave schnazzy again

541
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
is me again

542
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,159
uh web enthusiast

543
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,120
um now first i really want to agree with

544
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
ecker uh like i brought

545
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
uh three three newcomers with me to this

546
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
meeting

547
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,000
uh i didn't tell them to read the dao

548
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
first because like kecker says it is

549
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
somewhat inscrutable

550
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,880
um so

551
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
having a better format that is what

552
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,799
people expect is what we should do

553
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,640
because we should meet people where they

554
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,760
are

555
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,280
if we're looking to have more newcomers

556
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,679
which i personally believe we are

557
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,960
um

558
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,360
so that said if some folks feel strongly

559
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
that this should be an rfc

560
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,520
well the correct solution would be a

561
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,960
mutable i've seen but uh i'll avoid the

562
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
third rail over there

563
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,159
um

564
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,880
then yeah just have a thing that takes

565
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
the website turns it into text and then

566
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,080
have the ise publish it at once a year

567
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
like

568
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
get rid of as much process as you can we

569
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
already spent our enough of our wheels

570
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
and our time

571
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,720
naval gazing over here and you know just

572
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
having someone do it as opposed to

573
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
spending hours and hours sounds like the

574
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
right path forward i'd rather all of

575
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
that time and energy be spent on making

576
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,360
better tutorials for newcomers

577
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
thanks and

578
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,679
i'm going to close the queue in just a

579
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,400
moment

580
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
so please add yourself

581
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
now if you want to get on the uh the

582
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
bandwagon here

583
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,600
uh we should have plenty of time andrew

584
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
uh campaign

585
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
uh

586
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
yeah so just pick up another and tip the

587
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,720
mic down a bit towards your mouth sorry

588
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
is that better yes thanks yeah so pick

589
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
you up under the number of points i i

590
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,799
agree i think with what ekka said uh

591
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,279
about the naming and so on uh

592
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
that could usefully be modernized to

593
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,919
make it more obvious what it's actually

594
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,039
for

595
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,919
the process seems uh

596
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
not fit for purpose

597
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,200
however

598
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
looking at the stats on the slide it's

599
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,200
only been updated three uh five times in

600
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,559
a decade

601
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,720
is that because of the process or is it

602
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
because actually there was no need to

603
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,600
update it anyway um so

604
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
to be honest if it only needed to be

605
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
updated five times the process is almost

606
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
irrelevant

607
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,279
even though it does feel not fit for

608
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,480
purpose

609
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
um

610
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,279
assuming that it will be updated more

611
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,919
frequently if the process was different

612
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,279
then

613
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
so tying it back to an rfc may be

614
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
updated every three years to catch up um

615
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
but empowering someone to

616
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,840
sort of manage the the page in the

617
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
meantime would seem like a good way of

618
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,039
doing it

619
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,559
um

620
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,400
and maybe

621
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
since it's mainly for newcomers i would

622
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
suggest perhaps uh uh putting under the

623
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
responsibility of emodia as a working

624
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
group

625
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
um to uh just keep oversight uh of the

626
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
content in in the intervening three

627
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
years would sound like a good solution

628
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,159
didn't say that on the slides there is

629
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
an editor team for the dao that is sort

630
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,919
of maintaining it and and they are at

631
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,440
least sort of cross reviewing each

632
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,679
other's changes and i think it's been

633
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
done in github now

634
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,320
in a way that isn't congruent with 6722

635
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
but that also allows the community to

636
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,919
see the proposed changes and weigh in

637
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,000
and recently that's had has happened

638
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
more frequently so we have that team and

639
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
i didn't mention it

640
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
yeah there's a whole separate

641
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,919
conversation about github but maybe

642
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,039
that's for another place

643
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,679
um miria you're an action queue yeah me

644
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,960
i could even so actually one point i

645
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
wanted to make is about this like if

646
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
they need to update and yes there is a

647
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
need because it outdates very quickly

648
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,360
there's things that are changing and

649
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,279
just like not correct anymore but on the

650
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,880
other hand no there's no need because it

651
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,159
doesn't seem anybody actually cares

652
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,200
about it

653
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,559
so um

654
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,760
and

655
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,679
and like this is really not the right

656
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,679
document for newcomers there's very

657
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,279
little information that's helpful for

658
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,960
newcomers when i was a newcomer the only

659
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,559
information that i got out of this is

660
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,840
that i don't have to wear a suit which

661
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
was very helpful but it's a very long

662
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
document for that and i agree with ekka

663
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
it's not in the right format that like

664
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,279
the information is easily accessible so

665
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,640
this idea this is for newcomers we

666
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,159
should just like completely forget about

667
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,320
it so what's that what's the top down

668
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,279
for um i don't know i'm like i also feel

669
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,960
sad about this getting rid of it because

670
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,559
it's part of our tradition it's part of

671
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,559
our culture but on the other hand we

672
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
will never get rid of it because it's

673
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,840
it's published as an rfc and even it's

674
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
if it's like historic or obsoleted or

675
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
whatever it will be around people keep

676
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,200
eating it so it will be there forever i

677
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,559
think we should just do nothing and

678
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,240
forget about it

679
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,520
and not being able to get rid of stuff

680
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
is also part of our culture

681
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
uh and just to say georgios you don't

682
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
have to stand there you can't take one

683
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,120
of the seats we'll we'll call i swear

684
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,039
i'll call

685
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
jim fenton you're up next hi jim fenton

686
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
uh i think there's actually at least two

687
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,840
issues here one is the the structure of

688
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,960
the document or what it says and and um

689
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
you know is it like one long piece of

690
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,039
text like it is currently or do we break

691
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,200
it up into pieces or somehow make it uh

692
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
friendlier and easier i think ecker had

693
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
a lot of great points on that and then

694
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
there's the other question of how we do

695
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,880
uh uh configuration control on it uh it

696
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,520
seems to me like something github or

697
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,360
something of that sort is

698
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,520
very well suited to doing this you you

699
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
keep the history you it it accommodates

700
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
you know breaking it up into a bunch of

701
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
pieces that link to each other and so

702
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
forth so

703
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
i would i would recommend that we might

704
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,480
possibly want to publish one more rfc

705
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,840
that uh just you know supersedes or you

706
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,440
know uh updates the the the latest one

707
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
that was published that says

708
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
go look go look here instead of in

709
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
instead of for this text directly

710
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
just so that we have something that

711
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
people can reference although honestly i

712
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
think we should be focusing on

713
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
trying to

714
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
make the

715
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
the document as useful as possible to

716
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,919
participants

717
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,760
and if somebody wants to reference it

718
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
fine but i don't think we should really

719
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,639
have to focus on that

720
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,360
dkg

721
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,480
um hi uh i want to echo what everybody

722
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,679
else is saying about this not being

723
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,399
appropriate for newcomers for

724
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,640
the class of basically all newcomers who

725
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
might come to the itf i read the dao

726
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,159
when i started coming here

727
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
uh you know i thought it was interesting

728
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
but people shouldn't have to there was a

729
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
comment made earlier that people who

730
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
don't have the time or the patience to

731
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
read this kind of document won't do well

732
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,919
at the ietf which makes it sound like

733
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
this is some sort of hazing ritual

734
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,559
and uh i don't i don't like hazing i

735
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,399
think i mean i i enjoyed reading it

736
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,600
myself but i don't like hazing and um i

737
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
i have to agree with jim that we should

738
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,640
publish a tombstone that points towards

739
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
something that emo der can keep up to

740
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,000
date that's actually focused towards the

741
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,240
tasks that newcomers want to do

742
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,679
and is indexed in a way that's

743
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,159
accessible to people who are not

744
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
uh greybeards

745
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,480
jay it's so good that you're vertical

746
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,279
enough to join us you're up go right

747
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,320
ahead

748
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,279
thank you um not actually vertical

749
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,159
um

750
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,760
so yeah i

751
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,840
pretty much agree with myria and ecker

752
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
and others that

753
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
a lot of work went into this document it

754
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,840
was marvelous in its time but that time

755
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,279
i think possibly passed 10 years ago

756
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
that just to break down some of the

757
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,960
problems with it because i think people

758
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,279
may not necessarily understand it

759
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,399
the tone

760
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,120
the way it's written you the newcomer is

761
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,000
actually quite divisive in that um

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,559
it's full of things that say you might

763
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,679
think this but no actually we do this

764
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,520
um which makes me want to run to reach

765
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
out and you know each time i hear that

766
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,039
one

767
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
it's strangely enough it's a reference

768
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
from some stuff that is nowhere else

769
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,480
it's the only place that tells us how

770
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
what the dots are on people's badges

771
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,559
it's got a very odd set of content when

772
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,200
you read it it's reasonably unbalanced

773
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
in some ways

774
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
and it's got a lot of folklore in it so

775
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,600
i i think that we as ekka said we need

776
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,120
to take a very different approach that

777
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
is multi-layered i would not want to

778
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,559
lose

779
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
what people think is important in here

780
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,320
the folklore and other things i would

781
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,399
not want to lose the community input

782
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,880
into these things those are vital so

783
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
whatever structures we create going

784
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,399
forwards are useful

785
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
but basic well newcomers guides and

786
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,880
taking things forward i i would i i to

787
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
be entirely honest with you i cringe

788
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
whenever we tell a newcomer to look at

789
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,640
the dow it's going to put them off more

790
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,840
than it's actually going to help them

791
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
and so i really like us to take a

792
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
different approach there

793
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,640
thanks and and feel better uh martin

794
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
duke uh martin duke google and

795
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
enthusiast for the iesg having less work

796
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
um self-interestedly uh so number one

797
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
plus one to the uh keep it as a cultural

798
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,640
artifact don't use it for newcomers um

799
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,880
but the the two the two i think new

800
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,039
points i'd like to make is um

801
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,679
number one i don't think it's an actual

802
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,519
like metric how frequently this is

803
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,440
updated and it's not a problem that

804
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
hasn't been updated in x years if it's

805
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
fine it's fine

806
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,559
especially if it's just the cultural

807
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,760
artifact

808
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,080
and the second thing is um

809
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,399
regarding iesu review like it's an

810
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,640
informational document so you just need

811
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,440
one

812
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
yes ballot to make it to to move it

813
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
forward so it's i mean as an isg member

814
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
i wouldn't necessarily feel compelled to

815
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
review this document if i didn't care um

816
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,559
which is i guess the status quo

817
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,960
of which is the case for either like not

818
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,519
rc versus rsc and given your points

819
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,440
about just the ease of using the tracker

820
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,399
and all that

821
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,360
why not make it an rfc um

822
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
just to

823
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,559
just to simplify the paperwork without

824
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,000
actually causing any more work for the

825
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,519
isg

826
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
thanks

827
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
georgios

828
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
yeah thanks

829
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,039
sorry for staying in the in the queue

830
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,960
your comfort not mine yeah i have a um

831
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,480
some ideas on on what could happen

832
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,200
um for example if you look at other sdos

833
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,919
there are articles of associations that

834
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,679
are very important for a certain sdo

835
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,760
the tao is not hasn't

836
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,840
you could not consider it to be in the

837
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
same category but

838
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,159
there are some topics like

839
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,640
you know the operation of the work group

840
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,519
and working group and uh the chairs and

841
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,120
all these things that are

842
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,399
somehow formalizing the way of how

843
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,720
uh the process in groups and the

844
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,519
leadership of the groups are uh

845
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,600
have other document structures that

846
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,559
specify those yeah 24

847
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,720
years but they are for some not there

848
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,919
are some

849
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,039
if you look into some sections are

850
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,679
referring to some websites

851
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
so i don't know i mean

852
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,440
a little closer to the mic georgios they

853
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
say they're having a hard time hearing

854
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
you yeah so there are two types of

855
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,519
information one of these for informal

856
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,320
for you know for newcomers but other one

857
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,480
other information that's more formal so

858
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,200
i don't know if there is a way to

859
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,279
to to make the selection and for the

860
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,320
informal you know inform for the

861
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
information that is only

862
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,559
used uh you know by uh by newcomers i

863
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,120
don't know i agree with uh with media

864
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,559
and jay

865
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,799
but for the formal one we maybe we

866
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,399
should think fair further but

867
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,919
there isn't anything formal in this

868
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,519
document because it's an informational

869
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,079
document so nothing in it

870
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,440
carries any

871
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
weight when it comes to the standards

872
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,639
process it might explain things slightly

873
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
differently but 24 18 is the thing that

874
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
that matters when it comes to working

875
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,879
groups in 2026 obviously

876
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
for the overall process

877
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,359
but i will point out that as jay said

878
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,119
the dots are only defined in this

879
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,679
document which is an odd thing

880
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,560
right

881
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,839
they're also on the newcomers

882
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,639
orientation slides

883
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
okay but i thought by leaning in that

884
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
there is some you know some difference

885
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,520
in information

886
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,719
thanks

887
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,719
uh west europe

888
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
yep i i find it interesting that a lot

889
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,480
of people that aren't newcomers are

890
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
standing up saying that the document's

891
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
not useful because they're no longer

892
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,800
newcomers to a large extent

893
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,399
you know there are oddities in it i will

894
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,040
say that it is too long uh there are

895
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,560
certainly it could be trimmed the fat

896
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,200
could be you know trimmed we could make

897
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,359
it a better document i think it's up to

898
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,960
you know emodure to figure out how to

899
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
fix it

900
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,320
that being said with my guides head on

901
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,480
we refer every newcomer to it and we've

902
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
had a lot of people saying it's a useful

903
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
document so you know i'm not there seems

904
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
to be a discrepancy between this between

905
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,000
the people that have been around a long

906
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,359
time saying whether it's useful and the

907
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,720
newcomers that have told me hey that's a

908
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
useful document but it's you know too

909
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,520
long

910
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
um i think a rewrite is definitely an

911
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,720
order karen

912
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,160
waking up karen

913
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,680
karen hello

914
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
i i will say that i think one of the

915
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
things we should do is on the thursday

916
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,720
newcomer feedback session ask how many

917
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,400
people read it and get their feedback on

918
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,920
it i think that would be valuable data

919
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680
and i think that we can take on you know

920
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,119
doing that as well

921
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,200
but please don't get rid of it because i

922
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
need something to point to

923
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
it's it's they need to at least some

924
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
briefing material and yes there's

925
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
training slides and that might be good

926
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
too but some document that people can

927
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,480
read coming up even if it's a whole lot

928
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,000
shorter and a whole lot simpler which

929
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,920
would be a good thing i need something

930
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,480
to point to

931
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,078
peter thompson

932
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
hi it's peter from desec

933
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,680
so essentially i agree with wes and

934
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
i'm quite new to the itf i would say i

935
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,079
don't know a bit more than a year

936
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
and i did read the tower and i did find

937
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,839
it quite useful um

938
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,359
so i don't know perhaps it could be a

939
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,839
little bit more concise but i don't

940
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,440
i don't think that requires a change in

941
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,839
format

942
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,839
then the second thing i wanted to say is

943
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,720
that i

944
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
also agree with what somebody else said

945
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
that frequency and change is not a good

946
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,359
metric

947
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,000
for whether the format is right

948
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
or for whether the process of updating

949
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,520
it is right i think um the frequency

950
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,079
of uh updates should

951
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
correspond to how frequently we want to

952
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
update it and i don't know how often we

953
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,720
want to update it perhaps there is

954
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,520
i take this off because my beard

955
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
so um

956
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
if you want to update it let's say

957
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
three times a year and then we

958
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,400
are not able to actually do that because

959
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,839
of process then of course the process

960
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,359
has to change but for example it would

961
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,200
also be possible to

962
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,280
combine updates and only do it i don't

963
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,880
know every two three years because i

964
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,720
also don't think it's very important

965
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
that it's completely up to date i think

966
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
things that change are mostly details

967
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,280
and

968
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
even if a bigger thing should change

969
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,440
let's say we change the id structure or

970
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,119
something um

971
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,440
it's not so important for a newcomer to

972
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,400
have that update immediately i think

973
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
and

974
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,960
yeah then

975
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
if people don't read it

976
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
i think it needs to be advertised better

977
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
i think that's true for all kinds of

978
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
newcomer material so let's say we

979
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
replace this with something else let's

980
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,599
say we have a

981
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,560
video

982
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
you know a set of tutorial videos and

983
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,560
how the itf works or something like that

984
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,839
then people wouldn't consume that

985
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,480
necessarily either and it needs to be um

986
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
more prominent regardless of format and

987
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
if the the problem is that people don't

988
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,720
consume it then we should

989
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
um make it more prominent and if we're

990
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,440
trying to gather data like wes suggested

991
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
for um

992
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,680
who

993
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,280
thinks it's a good thing of those who

994
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,880
read it we could also ask the other ones

995
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,079
why they didn't read it perhaps they

996
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,440
didn't see it or they did see it it was

997
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
too long or they did see it they didn't

998
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
care and if they don't care then perhaps

999
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,000
they wouldn't care about other material

1000
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
too

1001
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,800
thanks stefan

1002
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,440
so stefan wenger

1003
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,960
i just

1004
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
i dug through very very very old files

1005
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,880
of mine and uh i did a little bit of

1006
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
expert witness work on the side and i

1007
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,839
remembered vaguely that this was that a

1008
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,000
version of the dao was actually

1009
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,520
cited yeah um

1010
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,440
in a lawsuit and it's indeed true that

1011
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,720
was the

1012
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,119
what

1013
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,160
4677 version yeah so don't suspect

1014
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,680
that's

1015
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
things that could be viewed as

1016
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
informal representation of process

1017
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
documents

1018
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,560
wouldn't be read by people who may have

1019
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,640
an agenda that's adverse to your

1020
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,880
employer's agenda for example

1021
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,440
and wouldn't be interpreted in a way

1022
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,960
that's adverse

1023
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
so i'm saying that for two reasons one

1024
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,160
reason obviously if we are if we are not

1025
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
maintaining this as an rfc we need a

1026
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
tombstone i mean that's that's a

1027
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,400
no-brainer but the other reason is

1028
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,079
don't take this thing lightly as

1029
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,480
it's for the newcomers blah blah blah no

1030
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,040
it's not yeah the people who litigate

1031
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
this type of stuff are kind of newcomers

1032
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,079
too and they put a lot of weight on or

1033
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,680
at least in one case that i've witnessed

1034
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,359
myself they have put a little bit of

1035
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,319
weight on this thank you

1036
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
all right sam you get the last word from

1037
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,359
the floor

1038
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
sam weiler not a newcomer lars thank you

1039
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,320
for the well formulated questions

1040
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
i heard some suggestions here that i

1041
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,400
really don't like namely that of

1042
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,119
snapshotting the updates as rfcs

1043
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,200
because i never want to go looking for a

1044
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
document and find two versions that look

1045
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
like they might be the most current

1046
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
right the rfc and the actually current

1047
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,160
one so i would say please don't go back

1048
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,280
to the rfc stream if you can avoid it

1049
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,160
i'm fine with saving the isg the work

1050
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,680
and if you need something less

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,880
prescriptive than 6722 gives you

1052
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,359
as i think you observed you can ignore

1053
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:28,240
6722 or go issue an update to it

1054
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
but please don't

1055
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,599
give us multiple current appearing

1056
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,119
versions to confuse people

1057
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
so

1058
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,160
i i

1059
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,720
have been trying to absorb whether there

1060
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
is some consensus about what the

1061
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,440
dispatch answer here is

1062
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,319
um

1063
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,119
i suspect that kirsty and i will have to

1064
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,520
go circle back and review all of the

1065
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,079
comments and the notes in the chat room

1066
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,359
um

1067
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,760
i mean yeah kirsty says uh uh

1068
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
you know there is some indication that

1069
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
people are in favor of materials for

1070
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
newcomers but

1071
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
not completely in agreement about what

1072
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,880
that what those should be

1073
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,040
um

1074
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,520
i think we'll try and discuss offline

1075
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,359
for a bit and see if we can

1076
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,520
summarize this

1077
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,000
uh do you have any

1078
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
further comments or did you get enough

1079
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,200
from that discussion

1080
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
want to see our summary first

1081
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,560
i'd like to see your summary because i'm

1082
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
similarly confused at the moment i need

1083
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,040
to read what was said oh yeah there

1084
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,520
wasn't any clear indication

1085
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,680
and there were lots of good suggestions

1086
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
of different things to do but it didn't

1087
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
seem like we were circling toward one

1088
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,119
particular one so

1089
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,480
maybe we have to

1090
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,240
boil down to a few

1091
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,839
sort of general

1092
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,079
suggestions and see where the group is

1093
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,240
pointing the other thing we might try

1094
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,599
and that we can do in parallel right

1095
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,359
would basically ask the

1096
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,440
editors of the dao to

1097
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,480
do a short you know half pager on what

1098
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
they would like to use as their process

1099
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
going forward because they're actually

1100
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,359
doing the work

1101
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,920
and and if that manages to you know

1102
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,839
capture consensus then we're done

1103
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,920
yeah that doesn't seem unreasonable to

1104
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,640
me

1105
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,000
okay um i think we have some work to do

1106
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
as as chairs and then we'll get back to

1107
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,200
the group

1108
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,640
thank you that's

1109
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,720
been good input

1110
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,520
so

1111
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,680
let me do a little refresh of the slides

1112
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,200
to make sure i have the most current

1113
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,920
and see if

1114
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,160
oops

1115
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
that's not what i wanted to do

1116
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,399
uh

1117
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,879
refresh there we go

1118
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
off

1119
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,680
on

1120
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,879
chair slides

1121
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,040
okay

1122
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,799
look at that things are updated

1123
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
all right

1124
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,319
so going on to the nom-com eligibility

1125
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,680
thing

1126
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,400
well let me first summarize where

1127
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,280
what happened this week so martin duke

1128
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,160
had uh written up a draft and had some

1129
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,760
discussion about

1130
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,280
uh plausible

1131
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,040
outcomes for changes to the nomicon

1132
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,560
eligibility

1133
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,760
for those who don't know the issue

1134
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,480
we have this experiment underway about

1135
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,640
dealing with remote participants and

1136
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,079
other

1137
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,440
qualifications for people

1138
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
to be um on the nom-com and of course

1139
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,800
now that we've gone back to hybrid

1140
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
meetings and this is going on for some

1141
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,319
period of time the question comes up

1142
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,400
well now we have to make adjustments to

1143
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,200
what we had said earlier um there was

1144
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
some discussion back and forth earlier

1145
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,440
this week a few people got together in a

1146
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,599
side meeting chatted for a bit

1147
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,720
and

1148
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
lars

1149
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,560
basically proposed that he would be

1150
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,319
happy with doing this as a working group

1151
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,640
a quick spin up spin down kind of

1152
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,920
working group that we've done in the

1153
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,119
past

1154
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,160
and

1155
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,079
so the

1156
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,040
dispatch question reduces more to

1157
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,119
does anybody in the room think it's a

1158
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,359
bad idea for lars to take that on he

1159
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,160
would still like our input

1160
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,200
so

1161
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,079
barry wrote up a

1162
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,319
quick charter proposal

1163
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,880
and uh you can see it here on the screen

1164
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,599
i'll give you a bit to read it over

1165
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,280
and

1166
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,920
we would like input on whether folks

1167
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,160
think this is a good thing to just toss

1168
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,040
off

1169
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
as a quick working group

1170
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,640
or have

1171
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,480
you know objections to such

1172
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,760
consider the queue open for discussion

1173
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,160
uh well ted's up there first so we'll

1174
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,720
let ted speak

1175
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,599
uh howdy i just point out that

1176
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,280
right now we use the non-come

1177
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,599
eligibility as eligibility

1178
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,119
criteria also for recall committees

1179
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,920
so i think we would have to clarify

1180
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,000
whether when something says only

1181
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,400
eligibility to volunteer for the nom-com

1182
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,319
we actually also mean all the other

1183
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,480
things that we use nom-com eligibility

1184
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,319
as a signal for

1185
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,440
uh or whether we really mean uh exactly

1186
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,599
this and only this

1187
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,520
i personally think it would be quite odd

1188
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
to have one for the nom com and a

1189
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
different one for recall committees not

1190
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,560
that we've seen one in the wild um but

1191
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,480
uh i think clarity would would be

1192
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,240
welcome here uh i do think that

1193
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,279
you dispatch your question

1194
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
sorry just to answer go ahead

1195
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,079
uh the dispatch question uh a

1196
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,359
short-lived working group certainly

1197
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,000
seems like the right thing to do

1198
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,160
sorry about that i was just going to say

1199
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,599
if you didn't see it in the distance

1200
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,359
barry gave you a big thumbs up when you

1201
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,920
suggested the change so

1202
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,720
anyway uh ecker you are next up in the

1203
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,880
queue all right just to add two things

1204
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,240
just to add a list of things it has to

1205
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,160
cover is also um

1206
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,240
uh recall signature eligibility not just

1207
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,000
recall committee eligibility um which i

1208
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,160
think it should cover all um uh saying

1209
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
they're the same the same it's the same

1210
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,079
essential electorate um i think this is

1211
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,400
this all seems fine um ordinarily i'd be

1212
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
here to like tell you that the 2011 was

1213
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,359
science fiction but actually i think

1214
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,040
it's achievable in this case um so yeah

1215
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,359
we've done a couple of really quick ones

1216
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,920
but yes um and just responding to both

1217
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,560
of those i i knocked this together

1218
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,800
just before the working group chairs

1219
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,520
form started in about three minutes so

1220
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,599
yes i left that out and

1221
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,560
that needs to be tweaked

1222
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,319
uh

1223
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,119
dave

1224
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,520
dude it's kenazi uh

1225
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520

1226
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,559
thumbs up

1227
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,160

1228
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,119
great

1229
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,040

1230
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,839
not up enough um yeah okay

1231
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,839
everyone else it should happen um it's

1232
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,480
gotta happen really quickly because

1233
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,040
there will be data tracker changes and

1234
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,319
robert's probably only got so much

1235
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,000
bandwidth to do them

1236
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,040
and

1237
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,559
that's it

1238
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,160
and for those who didn't notice rich's

1239
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,240
orange dot it's going to be his problem

1240
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,200

loop now because you've already

1243
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,720
published the list yeah

1244
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,880
all right uh well you're going to be on

1245

yeah so lars sorry go right ahead yeah

1247
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,800
larry sagar um i wanted to quickly get a

1248
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,280
sense of the the group whether we're

1249
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,359
comfortable with doing a

1250
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,800
a buff-less working group

1251
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,839
a fair question uh i see at least thumbs

1252
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,520
up in the audience

1253
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,400
uh does anybody want to raise a concern

1254
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,040
about that come to the mic

1255
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,160
put yourself in the queue

1256
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
we could do a poll but i saw enough

1257
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,440
hands go up

1258
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,160
that's fine

1259
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,880
and oh rand robert and russ both say no

1260
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,359
buff on the chat and olaf says plus one

1261
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,960
go ahead and charter looks good john

1262
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,680
says uh martin please go right ahead

1263
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,520
yes martin duke google so i just would

1264
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,280
like to state for the record that i'm

1265
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,599
i'm happy to be the author of the

1266
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,599
product for this um and for those of you

1267
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,119
who saw my gen dispatch draft i'm by by

1268
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,280
mutual agreement and the side meeting um

1269
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,839
i will strip out the criteria changes

1270
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,000
and use the 8989 criteria as a baseline

1271
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800
uh so if there's any controversy you can

1272
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,040
save that for the working group

1273
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,920
thanks excellent and by the looks of the

1274
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,440
uh chat room

1275
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,760
there there is uncharacteristic

1276
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,079
happiness and agreement

1277
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,960
so uh i think we're doing well any other

1278
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,119
questions you have lars

1279
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,800
no not a question but um i'm also

1280
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,960
looking for chairs i'm specifically

1281
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,720
interested in some former nom-com chairs

1282
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,640
that might want to serve again and that

1283
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,319
have significant cycles over the next

1284
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,960
six months because this will need to be

1285
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,280
kept on track like we need an rfc before

1286
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,599
the next bum come cycle right

1287
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,760
uh good point uh suresh you wanted to

1288
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
make a comment

1289
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,079
volunteer you're volunteering aren't you

1290
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,319
suresh he runs back no come on up that's

1291
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,480
okay

1292
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,240
uh senator so i just want to make sure

1293
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
like i saw very chatter right i know

1294
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,440
it's quick

1295
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,920
um but i think it needs to talk about 87

1296
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
13 instead right because the goal is to

1297
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,000
replace 8713 with this bcp

1298
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,839
not to continue 18 and 89 so i just

1299
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,359
wanted to make that clear it's like even

1300
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,640
reading the document it was not like

1301
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,079
totally clear that's what it's intending

1302
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,920
to do because i was trying to do a point

1303
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
update on 8713 but

1304
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,520
this would be probably like a full

1305
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,880
rewrite of that right so thanks

1306
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,319
yeah if martin if you want to just

1307
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,720
respond to that go right ahead so i'm by

1308
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
far by i'm far from an expert on this

1309
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,839
but my understanding was that 8713

1310
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,160
addresses a number of nom-com issues and

1311
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,880
there's like a specific section like 414

1312
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,800
that is about the eligibility

1313
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,400
and so

1314
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,599
88

1315
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,480
80

1316
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,079
80 90 thank you

1317
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:44,960
uh

1318
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,040
specifically updates that but as

1319
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,720
experimental so we essentially upgrade

1320
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,480
that to standard we continue to update

1321
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,079
87.13

1322
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,040
okay

1323
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,200
i would point out that whether this

1324
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,559
updates a point in 8713 or

1325
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,440
obsoletes or updates 89.89 to update

1326
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,000
that point in 87.13 seems like in the

1327
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,760
weeds of the process

1328
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,480
so this is barry i i i will take the

1329
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
action to

1330
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,319
adjust the charter text appropriately

1331
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,319
and we'll pass it back by the mailing

1332
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,440
list before we go further so excellent

1333
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,480
um

1334
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,400
becker yes i just meant to say i'm quite

1335
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,800
confident that like between barry and

1336
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,640
mars they can sort out which things

1337
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,279
update something

1338
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,280
thank you suresh you have another

1339
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,440
comment no like my content is really we

1340
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,040
don't want to go back to the kind of

1341
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,640
thing where like the norm comes of us

1342
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
strewn across multiple documents like i

1343
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,079
think like barry kind of worked on it

1344
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,920
like with murray and gang to kind of

1345
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,599
pull all these things together into one

1346
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,079
place and i think we should try to kind

1347
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,920
of keep it all together so it's not hard

1348
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,359
for somebody to find these things that

1349
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
was kind of why i wanted to push for

1350
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,680
that like a full update rather than a

1351
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,119
point update

1352
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
appreciated uh

1353
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,000
this is being discussed on eligibility

1354
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,760
discuss

1355
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
um and and i think that is the

1356
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,319
appropriate form to hash out what the

1357
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,520
charter should say um so yeah uh rich go

1358
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,359
right ahead okay i forget to handle it

1359
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,119
on eligibility to discuss that's great

1360
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,440
but this is a real small minor update

1361
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,880
for changes in modern global conditions

1362
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,440
like hybrid and remote so i really would

1363
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,800
hate to see us

1364
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
open up the whole nom com selection

1365
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,520
process hold.com

1366
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,240
process document i will read that as you

1367
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,839
recommend that the charter be very

1368
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,960
tightly scoped

1369
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,680
yeah

1370
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,839
martin duke uh google um yeah plus one

1371
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,559
of rich like 8713 covers a lot of stuff

1372
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,880
and if our scope is simply eligibility i

1373
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,400
don't think missing the whole thing is

1374
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,040
compatible with that

1375
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,079
suresh did you want to follow up on yeah

1376
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,319
no i i i fully understand uh rich's

1377
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,000
concern and martin's concern right like

1378
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,920
so uh it's kind of hard to find but i do

1379
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,920
understand like uh but uh one thing

1380
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,359
you've done is like kind of keep only

1381
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,960
this thing open for comment like that's

1382
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,160
probably the way to do it but i do

1383
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,839
understand the concern so i'm finding

1384
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,680
the way but like

1385
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,200
it i wanted to be easier to find all

1386
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,480
these things together in the same place

1387
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,160
that's it thanks

1388
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,680
maybe like a same bcp number going

1389
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,680
across this might make it easier as well

1390
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,720
but we can try that out too

1391
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,359
very good so lars i think summarize here

1392
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,280
i think what suresh is trying to say is

1393
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
um he's suggesting an update of um 8713

1394
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
whatever the number is um

1395
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
but basically leave all other sections

1396
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,400
unchanged and unchangeable

1397
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,559
so so do it do another patch document

1398
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,720
but do a full biz but but charter it

1399
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
such that nothing else can be touched

1400
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,640
other than that one section that would

1401
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,000
also be a way forward but we can discuss

1402
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,319
this on the list i i would suggest that

1403
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,040
you being the sponsoring a d of said

1404
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,000
working group uh can take that as input

1405
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,359
well

1406
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,720
um good anything else you need on this

1407
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,319
no this was super i got everything i

1408
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,040
wanted and we'll go forward with this

1409
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,280
thank you yay team

1410
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,839
uh rich did you have a follow-up yeah i

1411
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,079
just wanted to know what elegy stood for

1412
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,400
you just wanted to

1413
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,920
i just want to know what elegy stood for

1414
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,599
and apparently it's time to leg be a

1415
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,319
little yes okay

1416
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,359
um all right well i think we are

1417
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,280
actually ahead of schedule if i'm not

1418
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,400
mistaken

1419
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,359
uh we well we have five minutes left

1420
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,480
um

1421
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,760
so i think

1422
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,920
the summary from that discussion is

1423
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,880
clearly

1424
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,280
uh at least in the room we you've got

1425
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,119
very good support for going forward with

1426
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,960
this working group as

1427
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,559
you know uh charter with amendments and

1428
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,520
uh very tightly scoped um we'll get that

1429
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
summarized for you

1430
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
and

1431
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,160
get that out in the minutes

1432
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,880

1434
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,200

1441
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
term of things you had to cover much

1442
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,160

thank my co-chair for doing all of the

1447
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
background work that you all didn't

1448
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,200
notice that was going on in the

1449
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,440
background

1450
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,760
and we will get the summary out to the

1451

list as soon as possible confirm all of

1452
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,480
our decisions there and then

1453
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,400
i think in both cases forward to lars

1454
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,000

were on the two questions thanks

1456
